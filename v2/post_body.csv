That is the classic argument. [Americans for Prosperity](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/americans-for-prosperity-2/)!
They dont get as many juveniles. Thats punishment enough! Leave the corporations alone. This class warfare is ridiculous. They give and give and you entitled brats only take.
I wish this was an Onion headline. 
"This comment from the comments section of the article sums it up nicely: Republicans have been promising to shut down the government for 3 years. They have refused to conference on the budget for the past 6 months. The Senate agreed to a budget total they didnt like to compromise with Republicans. The votes are there in the House to pass a clean CR but Republicans have blocked the vote. This shutdown has been brought to you by Mr John Boehner, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Senate Conservatives Fund. "
"Its simple, really. Create chaos intentionally and then blame it on the other guy. "
"I like to consider myself a reasonable and measured participant in our nations politic, but I cannot find any way to describe what the GOP is doing other than directly hostile to the well-being of the country."
"Just compare Bachmanns Politifact rating with Obamas, or for that matter, Ted Cruzs http://www.politifact.com/personalities/michele-bachmann/ http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/ http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/ "
"Republicans dont like it when you correct them on this. I had this argument today already with a family member. I shut down their bullshit pronto by explaining the situation and dispensing with the fucked in the head talking points. It ended with blub blub blub, I dont want to talk politics.... "
They are like abusive parent see what you are making me do?
"Vote these people out and get the word out NOT just to the more liberal reddit people, but to the most conservative of the conservatives. The thing with voting is you need EVERYBODY on the same page. Talk to others."
"The Republican leadership are not brave enough to own this shutdown. They arent brave enough to compromise with the President on the deficit, to accept even $1 of tax increases for $10 of spending decreases. Instead of governing, they waste their time bravely showing off their conservative credentials through pointless, symbolic resolutions defunding Obamacare."
Pretty sure blaming him was also part of the plan.
"I think its time to enforce this. Seditious conspiracy (18 U.S.C. ? 2384) is a crime under United States law. It is stated as follows: &gt; If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seditious_conspiracy"
"Never mind the fact that Obama didnt vote for a shutdown. They did. And theyll get on TV, and say we voted to fund the government. And no one will ask them: You voted for a bill that you *knew* would not make it through the Senate or off the Presidents desk. You voted for a bill, you *knew* would lead to a shutdown and refuse to vote (or even bring to a vote) for a bill that will actually pass and will actually re-open the government. So how exactly are you not responsible for this shutdown? How exactly is this anyone elses fault but your own? How can you drive the car until the empty-gas light pops on, switch seats, and pretend its anyone elses fault but your own?"
"What I cant understand is why they have to blame anyone. According to them, the vast majority of the country wanted a shutdown."
The irony... we have been fighting our longest war against extremists abroad only to find them growing strong right here at home. The cancer that is the TeaPartyTaliban is now under our constitutional protection.
"Crazy people say crazy shit...again. Tide goes in, tides goes out, you just cant explain that. ;)"
"This is not about Republican vs. Democrat at this point. Its about money and personal power. This issue easily goes beyond Obamacare. Think very carefully about this... If Congress can stop the country and default on our debts to overturn ANY existing law, then NO law is really law. The Democrats have no choice but to take it to a default. No choice whatsoever. If they let it go to the brink and then cave, the Tea Party will know they can do it again and again and again. From that point on, any time EITHER PARTY wants to apply supreme pressure they would have the tool available to do so. It is crucially important that this new brinkmanship tool that is being tested... must fail, it has to Edit: Wow Reddit gold, thank you kind stranger!"
Its kind of like the Why did you make me hit you? logic of a domestic abuser. 
The problem with being pathological liars is that the Tea Party destroyed its credibility with the American people long ago. Theyve alienated everyone in the country.
"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-republicans-blame-obama-20131006,0,2739790.story Tea party Republicans blame Obama for the shutdown they planned "
"?It?s exactly what we wanted, and we got it,? Bachmann said to the Washington Post. So she blames the president, of course."
"Yes, the echo chamber is in full swing. Conservative friends on facebook are posting all sorts of rightist Bullshit claiming that it is Obamas fault. "
"Using the Presidents name in such a way is meant to evoke a Pavlovian response among their loyal dog pack. Notice its rarely the President or President Obama but simply Obama? Its meant to strip him of the dignity of the office so they can belittle him and look down upon him. Im reminded of a scene in the West Wing where President Bartlets in the Oval Office with his old priest, and the priest asks how to address him -- as Jed or as Mr. President, and he says to call him Mr. President, because he was acting as the office, not as the man. It seems Republicans are too quick to treat President Obama as ol Barry, the cantankerous son of a bitch that no one likes. I wish theyd just start treating him with the respect a President is due."
"What I find interesting is that most Republicans -- perhaps realizing that their sides position is flawed as shit -- opt to throw their hands in the air and say, *Both* sides are being ridiculous. They need to figure this out! Anytime you blame both parties, you come across as the neutral and fair person.... even when its clearly one sides fault. Politicians are despised, so the more of them you blame, the more people are like Yea, this person is reasonable."
We need to pass resolutions that take the money out of politics so the Koch brothers can stop trying to run the country. The fact that wealth = political power is disturbing. 
"That was the plan. Ted Cruz said it back in [July](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/cruz-government-shut-down-no-big-deal-because-it-happens-every-weekend). He also said that the shutdown would be just like the weekends. &gt; Now thats inconvenient, Cruz admitted, before adding but we actually see that every single week on the weekends"
And this surprises anyone how?
Its Obamas fault for being black!
If I were to ever meet bachmen I will kick her face in. The nerve she has to use a verterns horrible memories of a war to make herself and her party look better is heinous. 
Because thats how they planned it. Make shutdown happen then blame the other poeple for it. They didnt just plan the shutdown and say well I hope it works out. Gotta have plenty of ammo to try to knock out the ACA when pretty much everyone in the country wants it.
"To every single Redditor: its up to us to set the record straight every single time a tea bagger spreads this bullshit. I ask you to fan out and hit up every message board, every web forum, every chat room, every blog, every class room, every talk show, and every news reporter. Seize every encounter you have with a tea bagger. Keep repeating the truth. *The tea party caused the shutdown.* *The tea party caused the shutdown.* *The tea party caused the shutdown.* Team Reddit: You know what to do. *You know what to do*. Engage."
"If the shutdown hasnt affected how you will vote, why should the shutdown affect how Congress votes?"
&gt; Tea party Republicans blame Obama for the shutdown they planned What if part of their plan was to blame Obama for the shutdown they planned? Everything is going according to their plan then.
"Facts dont matter. You just need enough shitty people, to go on TV, with enough gall to confidently spout a lie, over and over again, until it sticks with some people. But since thats kinda long for a tagline, they went with Fair and Balanced."
"The teahadists are in a fact-resistant bubble. At this point they seem to have completely lost touch with reality. There is no possible way for the president to back down from this. If he did, it would be like Lincoln allowing the southern states to just break away. We simply cannot allow government by extortion. "
of course they do
"coming from the bible belt, heavily republican area I can confirm they all truly believe Obama ordered and caused the shut down. Its kinda disturbing. "
I really wish Congress would try another track on this. How about they take ALL funds sent to other countries and re appropriate the money to fund a truly free healthcare system for all Americans. There might even be a surplus. 
Thats a basic rule of propaganda: accuse the other side of what you yourself are doing.
TIL Tea Party Republicans tend to spend too much time on /r/thanksobama 
Bunch of morons
I just hate the term Obamacare. No its the Affordable Care act. We didnt call the No Child Left Behind act Bushisanidot. Also was watching Jimmy Kimmel and [hilarity ensued](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx2scvIFGjE).
"These people are insane, there is no denying it, or sugar coating it now. These people running the US into the dirt are mentally deranged assholes."
"Is this not the exact same logic as She made me beat her, its her fault or She was asking to be raped?"
"What a surprise, Republicans making a huge fucking mess and then blaming Democrats. Better call Ripley!"
This was their plan all along. They have been doing it for years. Sabatoge the economy and then blame the other side.
"Hey, if anybody wants to get together and protest the government shutdown, Im trying to organize some stuff over at http://www.reddit.com/r/DoYourJob/"
The sad part of it is that plenty of people are stupid enough to believe it.
"In other news: Rapist blames victim for him having shot her: I told her to just play along, but she didnt listen. Shes the criminal here!. "
"I hate the GOPs look what you made me do! attitude. Its an abusive relationship between not only both parties, but also between the people they are paid to lead. Vote them all out."
"Insane. Absolutely fucking insane. Republicans are sitting there saying; You wont defund a bill that has already passed both the House and the Senate, that has been signed in to law to provide health care for millions of people? Well, fuck you then, American People. Were going to run this country in to the ground, and youre going to suffer because we want our kickbacks from big pharmacy! This is the issue with a two-party system. Theres no tie breaker. For those saying that the Democrats are at fault here? Sure, they are. As much fault as the other lot of morons? Not even close! It would be different if the Republicans sitting up on the Hill were not essentially using terrorist, hostage tactics to get their way. And thats exactly what this is: Republicans being terroristic and taking the American economy hostage. And you know what? We dont fucking negotiate with terrorists."
Obama didnt roll over with his feet in the air! Its all *his* fault!
TIL Financing Debt is hard :(
"Seen that on the news this morning, with a clip of John Boner.. The president just needs to call us. He wont talk to us. Really, Boner? What the hell happened last week then?"
Fortunately most Americans disagree
Why is everyone surprised? The house voted to strike down the ACA 40+ times. Each time the senate voted against the House. Defunding it was planned because it was the last resort of house majority. Literally everyone in politics saw this coming. 
This just in: water is wet.
Bachmann is fucking retarded.
fuck the teabaggin morons. we blame you!!!! GOP shitheads.
I checked the entire thread... and it wasnt here yet so... Thanks Obama
"No politcal party has been a permanant fixture. Federalists, Jeffersonian Replublican, National Republican, Anti-Masonic, Whig, Liberty, Free Soil, The Know-Nothing, and Greenback parties have all become extinct due to becoming obsolete, or representative of minorities that were too small. If the Republican party doesnt begin to represent a larger portion of the people, its quite likely theyll join that list in the not-too-distant future. "
"I was watching Boardwalk Empire the other day and there was a scene where Al Capone and his gang goes to a political rally of a candidate they dont like and beat up the voters with bats. At first I thought damn, that probably happened back then and thats brutal. then I thought though it would solve the Tea Party cancer in this country..."
No shit
Ams republicans. Ams always rites
Too bad the majority of the populace sees right through their antics. This will cost them them 2014 elections and possibly the House majority. 
"Its called messaging, and the Republicans are brilliant at it."
"Before this, the Republicans had a shot at the Senate; now theyll be lucky to keep the House. If a Republican ever takes the White House again, itll be a fluke."
"It is Obamas fault. If he wasnt elected President, they never would have had to plan it! "
"I remember being mad about this kind of stuff in 2000. This is nothing new. This is their strategy, counting on the notion that their followers are too stupid/apathetic to know any better. And it works remarkably well. I will never understand the mindset of someone who cares enough to support a policy/person but not enough to understand what the thing/person they are supporting represents. Theres gotta be a line drawn where ignorance crosses over into evil."
I cant help but hope that they lose all credibility with anyone ever.
This is the best example of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) I have ever seen. Except I would change the word incompetence to stupidity.

So bad that this belongs on /r/notheonion. What is wrong with these people? Its no wonder so many people in America have given up on politics.
Accurate
"Water is wet, grass is green."
They absolutely have the ability to point at the sun and tell you its midnight. The last person I knew that could do this was named Kyle. He could break one of my toys and tell me its better that way. 
Its hard to imagine a more dishonest and despicable bunch of people than these Tea Bagger politicans
its time our 2 party system moved to democrats and green party. or something like that.
"As a swede watching this from the outside - this is how I see things. 1. A bunch of friends get together and decides to go out for dinner. They pick a restaurant and everyone orders lobster, drinks, blow and some hookers. 2. The check arrives and all of a sudden 20% of the dinner party starts screaming: No! We will not pay this bill! We dont care if this destroys the credit history for everyone! We need to save our money and should have stayed home eating bathtub minestrone instead! 3. The other 80% seems very confused and tell the 20% that since theyve already finished the meal, the blow and the hookers they really need to pay the bill and get out of there or else there will be dire consequences... 4. The 20% refuse to listen and one guy, lets call him Warfare Dazed Curl takes everyones wallet and burn them over the table candle while screaming that this is the only way. 5. Everyone in the party is pummeled by pimps, hooker, waiters and drug dealer that really wanted to get paid for their services. 6. Warfare Dazed Curl is stabbed to death on the senate floor."
"They are trying to. But Obama isnt asking for any additional funding for anything new. The left arent asking for anything, just funding for things already passed. And actually some house dems have offered to cave on the medical devices tax for a short term funding of the gov.. which is totally retarded. AS A. it will cause obamacare to go from reducing the deficit to increasing it. And B. The right will just extract more when this temporary measure is over. "
"Republicans love power, what is a bigger show of power than holding the most powerful country in the world hostage? They are ecstatic right now, drunk with power and giddy as can be. "
"You know what the best part is? The republicans will still control a large part of the house if not the majority, after the 2014 elections. For every informed voter there are a dozen morons willing to believe whatever they hear at photo ops like this. "
She is a true republicunt!

"wifebeater to wife: why do you make me hit you by wearing that dress! for a certain kind of psychology, this demented reality makes perfect sense "
"All they need to do is keep repeating we didnt want this and its Obamas fault and nearly half the people in the Country will believe it. Its not stupid if it works, but its certainly pathetic."
It blows my mind that people still think the shutdown is ALL about politics. Its articles like this one that fan the flames if racism and hate for fellow Americans. Why cant we all get along.
And the /r/politics circlejerk continues without a comma.
"America, your government system is flawed if something like this could happen "
"Thats the most inane first line. They did what they planned to do... Well ya, thats what people do who have plans."
When will we start openly calling the Tea Party what they are? ...they are domestic terrorists. The USA does not negotiate with terrorists. 
&gt;Tea party Republicans blame Obama for everything. There.
For a republican party whos been preaching smaller government for the last 6 years. They found a way guys! They won! This is Boehners America!
"Lets say for a moment that Im happy the government shut down. (Some libertarians actually think that more of the government should be shut down.) Why in the world would the Republicans then go and say that the shutdown was all Obamas fault? If thats the case, thats terrific and Im glad he got elected so he could do that very thing! Why would the Tea Party want me to feel SUPPORT for Obama because he did something I ultimately wanted?"
I dont know how this is news. They were blaming Obama for the shutdown before the shutdown.
They planned it so they could blame Obama. Simple.
"Correct me if Im wrong, but doesnt isnt the executive branch completely left out of spending decisions? I thought the senate was where the house was hitting a hard place."
"Oh man, as a European i love watching the clusterfuck that is US politics. I mean sure, our politicians are fucktards as well. But these people just take the fucking cake. Ha-ha-ha."
Taking the Thanks Obama meme way too far! 
"I dont see why were still debating this point, their whole plan and the way they marketed themselves was about shutting this mother down, and they were actually able to do just that. It would almost be impressive if they actually had a plan that went further than yelling yeahaw."
"Can you guys please do a switch, and throw the Tea Party in the water?"
I cant help but think that this is partly the 35 and under demographics fault because we are not nearly as vocal in our opposition to these types of tactics. We cant expect to just show up once every four years to vote and think that is enough. 
"As someone who spent most of his life as a republican, I reach out to my fellow right wingers and beg them to get their shit together and stop putting up with the lunacy that is the GOP. The party has gone to complete hell. And the Tea Party is smothering it while you sleep. This isnt your favorite football team. Dont stick with it out of loyalty."
Self-claiming legitimate news source publishes loaded article.
Its like Boehner wants to reenact the Clinton shutdown exactly. Griping about a snub didnt work out for Rush.

"What about this idea?: In the future there is a deadline in the event of a government shutdown. If that deadline is not met and there is indeed a shutdown, ALL members of congress are immediately put up for re-election and the issues that they cannot agree on are put up for popular vote by the citizens to resolve?"
They are hoping that the American public will collectively get Stockholm Syndrome.
They want smaller government and are getting smaller government. 
"These people are deranged, mad, insane, delusional and in a position where they control your life, that of your wife, your children. They have seated themselves at the table that decides what to do with the sick and dying, what to do with the weapons of mass destruction. They are mentally stunted minds that read like a Lovecraftian Horror story where their view warps and distorts the nations. And the American system is build to ALWAYS require them to be part of the political process. I will say goodbye to the comforts of society before you find me in the Republic of America."
"Theyve been doing this since the whole Tea party was made. Federal government shutsdown because a handful of them wants it to? Its someone else fault since they didnt compromise with us. They demand money while everyone else gets screwed over? We are hard working, god loving, patriotic Americans. Always pointing fingers and poking someone else in the eye. "

"What Im somewhat baffled by is how matter-of-fact they are just lying about the situation ... theres absolutely no nuance whatsoever, theyre just misrepresenting simple, basic, obvious facts. "
"There must be a way to circumvent Boner and end this another way. Ive read that we have enough votes, including 21 or 22 re pubs in the house saying they would vote for a clean CR (we only need 17). Cmon, geniuses of Reddit... Lets help them figure this out!"
Dude the fact that you all think we still have a 2 party system makes me laugh. We have a 1 party system with super rights and lefts that are all in it for the money. Good day sirs.
Hunt them down and kill them all. All the money men. All the Tea Partiers. Im sure Seal team 6 has nothing better to do
To all the tea party republicans... Upvotes dont mean we support you.

"What I dont understand is why the ruling party has decided to shutdown all other funded programs when the only one not funded is the ACA. That is unless theyre trying to use those programs as bargaining chips. I dont see how you can blame a political pressure group composed entirely of voters for you know... petitioning their representatives to to follow through with a plan to oppose the ACA. Thats pretty much the definition of democracy and like it or not, nearly half of the voters voted Republican."
"Vote them all out, its all a game."
"One of my Facebook friends (close friends 13 years ago) started shouting this is the reign of Obama! the first day of the shutdown. I called her out on it and she proceeded to say that if Obama had never introduced Obamacare, Congress would be talking about other things so therefore its Obamas fault. You just cant argue with that logic. "
"Thats like an arsonist saying well, you HAD a house! What was I supposed to do?"
"Democrats passed Obamacare when they had a majority and didnt get any Republican support. They told the Republicans we won so deal with it. Democrats no longer have a majority and they need Republican support to pay for Obamacare. Republicans now consider it pay back time. I personally blame the voters for the stalemate, they keep re-electing the same incumbents. "
Did anyone expect otherwise?
I say Obama should hit the GOP where it hurts; shut down all military purchases from the MIC until further notice. 
Next year: government shutdown until Protestantism is taught in every public school. The following year: government shutdown until liberalism is punishable by a life sentence of hard labor in southern cotton fields.
"as if it made any difference whether republicans or democrats mess up, eventually they all dont give a fuck "
"I dont know whats worse: The lack of shame with which the Tea party lies, or that the average American is so stupid that if it gets repeated enough they will believe it."

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.). ?It?s exactly what we wanted, and we got it.? &gt; On Saturday, conservatives rallied House Republicans around a plan to fund the government but ***delay the Affordable Care Act, President Obama?s signature health-care law, for a year.*** &gt; http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bachmann-denies-saying-shutdown-exactly-what-we-wanted-wapo-and-obama-misquoted-me/ &gt; ?That quote in The Washington Post you weren?t referring to?you didn?t want a government shutdown?? Blitzer asked. &gt; &gt; ?No, absolutely not. The quote was wrong and the president had misquoted me as well, probably taking it inadvertently from the The Washington Post that got it wrong.? Now I really am not defending the Republicans or the Democrats in either case. (And I really dont care to be on the MB defend train) Both majorly fucked this up and the problems are continuing to build. But Jesus Christ get your heads out of your asses for every chance to jump on Republicans for a misquoted story from a biased source. "
"Why arent Democrats being blamed for failure to negotiate a plan that would include support by Republicans? Is this purely a matter of the reddit community saying, We dont like what you want, so its your fault? Is this a legitimate alternative perspective?"
"I think whats really meant to be noticed is how the Republicans are holding the debt ceiling hostage. Later this month the US will hit the debt ceiling again. Congress will have to vote to either extend the ceiling or abolish it (hopefully) otherwise there could be another recession. The fact that the Republicans blame Obama for this is more than ridiculous, its monstrous. "
Too bad they apparently need the president to be their baby sitter. Also do people in the house and congress know there are other bills they can get rid of other than Obamacare? 
The fact they are able to do this really points out the flaws in the American Political system. It is broken.
Im truly amused at how the same community can hate the president for the overreach in internet surveillance even to the point of hoping for revolt and revolution but still be perfectly fine with the government forcing you by penalty of law to buy a product. On top of this its a product they have exempted themselves and colleagues from. If you are going to circlejerk at least do it right and have the goddamned common decency to finish with your mouth.

It became something my family would say when we encountered anything peculiar or out of step. I can see the tea party Congress members now. Locked behind their closed doors, adorning sacrificial robes, a dead lamb oozing blood from its throat. Koch Brothers laughing ominously via Skype. When out of a whisper the chanting mantra begins Popcorn monkey sitting on a duck once upon a manger again Popcorn monkey sitting on a duck once upon a MANGER! until the whisper turns to form a deafening battle cry.

David Horsey blames Tea party Republicans blame Obama for the shutdown they planned
So who else is ready to dissolve this atrocious congress? 
"*If you hadnt made me mad, I wouldnt have drowned your dog. Its your fault.*"
"*The government shutdown has revealed the impressive skill of tea party Republicans to say untrue things with sincerity so convincing that they almost sound as if they believe what they are saying. Michele Bachmann, with her toothy grin and startling wide-eyed stare, is especially adept at this.* Michelle Bachmann may be a sociopath. "
ITT sheeple that Democrats are glad believe whatever bashes Republicans The only people happier than the Republicans about this shutdown are the Democrats. And thats why our two parties suck. Both of them. The are both happy about something that does not benefit the general population that voted for their worthless asses. [We are winning...It doesnt really matter to us how long the shutdown lasts.](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303492504579113781436540284.html?mod=mktw) And it wasnt a Republican who said that. The Democrats are as non-negotiating as the Republicans. It is literally impossible for an argument to be because of only one party.
Classic doublethink.
"Sigh. Stories like this must be what let the Dems sleep at night. It sure isnt taking care of kids with cancer. The Tea Party didnt plan this, but they arent flinching from it either. The fight to bring some sanity back to DC has to happen sooner or later; might as well be now."
"LA Times calls Tea Party racist. Yes. In an article decrying reactionary politics, the lead image is someone wearing a Tea Party shirt is blaming the Black Guy. And ITT, circle-jerking, circle-jerking everywhere, not realizing that the real irony is the news article itself. I expect more Reddit. If I wanted this sort of blind reactionary bullshit, I would be on a Gaw**r media site."

Funny how the banks are too big to fail but the us government isnt.
They blame Obama when they step in dog shit. Litteraly anything is his fault
"I pulled this out of the comments for LA times. Sums up whats wrong with the article. Hunter St. James Tampa, FL NYT Pick.. Mr. Krugman, Youre egging on readers who are already strongly partisan. As such, you become part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Some of the policy positions of the Republicans are reasonable. For example, there are so many things President Obama could do to help ensure the long-term fiscal health of the country. He could address long-term entitlements, reform our tax code and fix Fannie and Freddie. If President Obama seriously addressed some of the reasonable policy goals of the Republicans, then youre opinion would make sense. But, he hasnt, so President Obama (and Harry Reid) and the Republicans all look childish. There is bad and stupid leadership and fierce partisanship on both sides of the aisle. None of this does the country any good. I wish President Obama had done more so I could agree with you, but he hasnt. So were all in a big mess, and there is plenty of blame to go around. Tempers need to cool, and youre not helping."

"Regardless of what side you are on, when will this country get serious about fixing the issues (specifically spending more than we bring in)? I want to see real plans on how to get back in the black - this never-ending crisis management environ simply puts us all in a worse situation than we already are in. Im all for taking care of people when they are down and out, but is there any reason why we should be handing out money without any expectation of return on investment? If you want something from the government (ie your fellow citizen) why wouldnt you want to give something back (ie your time)?"
Background: The Senate had passed the clean Continuing Resolution in September. Source:http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/vote_menu_113_1.htm Next step: The Republicans now need to allow the House to vote on it.
the entire lot of them need to be locked in a room and gassed
"I wish there was a way we could oust this fools. I dont care whether your a liberal or a conservative, these Republicans are a threat to America and are standing in the way of this nations recovery. To blame President Obama for this is *insane*. I dont care whether you like him or not, Obama is definitely not to blame for this. Hes not giving in to the will of people who wish to hold the economy hostage in order to get what they want. We dont negotiate with terrorists, and frankly, I think these people are just that. Political terrorists. The word asshole doesnt suffice, these people are actively trying to worry the American people with a shutdown they brought on and use our frustration as tool against those contradicting their will. It wont pan out well for them, I dont think were that stupid. How is it that politicians have to resign over dick pics yet people pull this evil stunt and they expect to be heralded as heroes. Theyre so disillusioned that they think that. I mean, like, shit man. If these people had tried the a similar thing 400 years ago in say... Japan, theyd be ordered to commit suicide. Somebody just needs to say it... Get. The. Fuck. Out. I hope they face *some* sort of consequences. How is this okay?"
*You Made Us Do It*
Can we shoot these people now? We seriously need to be rid of these poisonous elements.
Am I the only person that is absolutely enraged by this fallacy and play on their voters emotions? I mean COME ON.
"So closing off open-to-the-public memorials that arent closed on nights or holidays ([Open 24 hours a day 7 days a week](http://www.wwiimemorial.com/)) was not intended to inflict as much pain as possible? I hate Bachman, but I dont blame her calling out bullshit like this. Yes she was doing it for political gain, and yes Obama was closing it for political gain. Her political gain was doing the right thing, while Obamas political gain was doing the wrong thing."
"If you vote for any of these people, its your fault and yours alone. If you do not vote, its your fault and yours alone. Vote. you cannot complain if you do not vote. "
the republicans only shut down aca in the house. the democrats have refused to intriduce CRs for the rest in the Senate. please downvote these unpopular facts.
"Look what you made me do Where have we heard that before? Oh right, abusive husbands."
How about a boycott of businesses in Tea Party Caucus congressional districts? This shutdown seems to be driven by no more than 50 Representatives out of some 430. Surely it couldnt be too difficult to compile a list of businesses in these districts and publish?
"In their defense, what other defense do they have?"
Look what you made me do
This is like watching a scumbag husband beating up his wife while crying WHY DO YOU MAKE ME DO THIS?
Blame the black man. Thats the true American way. -_- this country need a revolution! 
Insanity knows no bounds
Wait a minute... This website may be biased!! *gasp*
"I dont think this is very difficult to understand. The Republicans wanted to shut down the government, if Obama didnt do what they want. Therefore, they are putting the onus Obamas actions. That is their line of thinking."

"I know Im going to get downvoted to hell, but is anyone going to mention that this is an editorial displaying someones personal opinions rather than an unbiased news article? If you agree with what the writer says, Im happy for you, but honestly, the way this article is presented almost makes it seem like its supposed to be an actual news article that is balanced, unbiased and serves to display the complete and not partial truth. I believe that having a multiple parties in the government is healthy because the party challenges each other to improve and keeps each other in check so that no party cant abuse their influence over others, but honestly I think that some people just let partisan loyalty and pride just ruin politics."
The tea-baggers blaming Obama is like kidnappers blaming their captives family for the kidnapping because they didnt pay the ransom.
"Interesting. Im subscribed to WSJ, and the commenters there hate Obama and the democrats, and Redditors (because opinions dont count as official reporting) hate the republicans."
"I do not support the ACA in its current construct, but this certainly goes too far. I would rather lose with dignity than win with deceit. Republicans have lost my vote for a while."
The only way this makes any sense at all is if the 80 members of Congress holding the US hostage are really Democrats hoping to regain control of the House.
This party of Hypocrites will soon be part of historys dustbin.
Why is the shutdown a bad thing?
Thats cool I blame Obama for not having toilet paper in my bathroom right now. :P 
There hasnt been a budget in years. The entire time we have used piecemail legislation to fund the government. Now Dems refuse to do so because Reps want what is clearly an unpopular and flawed piece of legislation amended before implemented. So the shutdown of everything other than Obamacare is his &amp; Harry Rieds fault for kamakaziing it and not doing what weve done for years of dead lock. 
Its like a guy who wants to talk with his wife about whether or not to have kids while standing in the delivery room. Thats whats happening here. Republicans are fucking baffling.
"That they planned? They planned to refuse to pass a budget that didnt defund the ACA. That isnt the same as planning the shutdown. The Democrats also planned to vote against any bills that defunded the ACA, even if they would have prevented a shutdown."
How about we balance the budget while raising the debt ceiling one last time!
At least we saved billions on our car insurance by switching to bullshit.
I say default! If we cant borrow any more we will be forced to balance budget! 17 trillion in debt is enough!
"&gt;We told the President that we were going to burn the house down if he didnt give us what we wanted. Since he didnt give in, it is obvious that he doesnt care that America will burn down to the ground. "
"Oh look. Opinion section of a website. When a Fox News Opinion section is posted mods delete it. Oh, but wait. This article bashes Republicans so its ok..."
"Ironically they are right to an extent, both sides have been playing the my way or the highway game. Most of the Republicans have wanted various things proposed by Obama but the Republicans are trying to do what their voters want, their own version of it anyway. Government shutdown is not much of a bad thing but its risky. Sometimes there are benefits to it. Its not really about the ACA, Obama actually refused to negotiate about a lot of things regarding budget. Since the shutdown, everyone is witnessing what Ive witnessed in every election since I was 10 years old. Its like a kindergarten war on Recess, mud and insults flying. No offence but the Democrats have been really immature about the shutdown."
No doubt the blaming was also in the plan.
"What a bunch of spoiled, ignorant assholes."
"As an independent, this makes all politicans look bad to me. People blaming one party nearly all belong to the opposing party. I see 4 major facts/problems that are causing the shutdown: 1. The government continually spends more money than it takes in and this disparity has been increasing for decades. This why the debt ceiling must be raised every 6 months or so to avoid a default. The debt ceiling is rising faster than GDP. This cannot continue forever. 2. The federal Government (and most states) has been steadily growing faster (i.e. spending) than GDP or population growth. That is a problem because the governments contributions to GDP are grossly inefficient compared to private industry. Continued growth of Government also cannot continue forever. 3. The tea party faction within the republican side of the house has decried that the US government is on the brink of a downward sprial of increasing interest on all that debt. They think the entire system is going to collapse soon and result will be at best drastic austerity measures, at worst total mad max style anarchy. While this may not be that case right now, it could easily happen in 10-20 years if the government continues to grow at a logarithmic scal as it has the last 10 years. 4. As our first president warned, the two party system can lead to dramatic splits in congress. When the house is divided, they cant tie their shoes much less agree on huge fiscal issues. The dvisiveness between parties today is not unlike that which existed before the Civil War (slavery was a catalyst not the cause as taught by revisionist History in High Schools these days). I totally unerstand what the tea party people are saying. I also understand that we appear backwards to progressive thinkers (i.e. lack of social safety nets). That said, our system is different from Europe. The States have much more power in the USA than other Western countries and they are often overlooked when talking about benefits and social welfare. Overlooking the power of the States is a mistake and ignores the lessons learned during the Civil War (poor economy + unwillingness to work together + a catalyst issue). Ignoring History in this case, could lead to some really terrible consequences. Reading the comments on reddit, it sounds like a lot of people hold so much angst towards the other party that they would be willing to go to war. I just hope it is only talk and people will eventually start to shut up and listen to the real problems we are facing so solutions can be found."
Saddest part about this is that Newt Gingrich did the exact same thing years ago and was made a laughingstock. The GOP just waits until people forget and then pull out the same trick again. 
Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself! -The Republican Party.
We are surprised by this how?
"If only he would just give in to our demands! What hes doing is irresponsible. I mean letting us hold the country hostage, its just not right! He should be ashamed of himself!"
"To the people saying this is the fault of the democrats *and* the republicans, I agree with you that the Dems and Obama should hold some of the blame, the Republicans are the ones who made this choice, knowing full well what would happen, and they deserve the lions share of the blame. "
Anarchy. Im out.
"that is the case, but its a shame the article comes with an absofuckinglutely terrible political cartoon."
Why are you hitting yourself? Look at what you made me do. Assholes.
"I am a contractor for NASA. I dont get reimbursed for the time i spend on furlough. Ive tried so hard to understand all this and i think the GOP is destroying itself just by not wording thier comments correctly. Please correct me if im wrong, but isnt it the governments responsibility to stop spending when its apparent they have over spent? If i max out my credit card i dont get to spend anymore and if i get a loan to pay the card down, use the card while also paying the loan that puts me in deeper debt...right? Trust me, im not a fan of either party right now and i dont like what my next paycheck will look like. It just looks like this folks are trying take credit for something that should have been fixed a long time ago and being pompous about is ridiculus."

Why dont one of you gun-toting freedom-loving Americans kill the republicans for shitting all over your government? 
It says something about a society that puts hundreds of thousands of non violent offenders in prison and also adheres to government principles written over hundred of years ago. What happened to people advancing their minds. With the invention of the Internet and the speed at which we have knowledge at our finger tips and we still LET a handful of people control the majority of US!
Everyone blames Obama. Only you Libs try to defend him. That has to be getting old by now.
"Democrats refuse to compromise about ACA because it has already been voted on 41 times. Republicans refuse to compromise on anything else, shut down 19 attempts at an attempt to compromise, cause a shutdown, threaten to cause a default, and then calmly tell everyone that the Democrats are holding the country ransom by refusing to cooperate with the people who have been saying that they will shut down the country for ages. Someone explain to me how this isnt terrorism, please."
"Gotta love news, most covered subject Ive seen is whose fault is it? , who cares... fix it and then if you REALLY have to and its THAT important, point fingers. "
"Blaming Obama and the Democrats was included in the plan, No surprises here."
"As someone from outside the USA, this hate the right has for Obama just seems like thinly veiled racism. Is this the case or not?"
"Well they do have a point, if the president wasnt black and was a republican Im sure the tea party wouldnt have shut down the government. "
Republicans. Bringing stupid to new heights. 
Why is everyone scared of tea party? If they are such a non movement then how could they use this diabolical schema to shut the government down? You pussys are just scared you will have to pay your student loans back and be expected to contribute to society somehow. Shut it down and the only clean bill is one that goes through line by line by line. Shut it down.... Everyone is so afraid the people we see we dont need the government in every aspect of our lives. We are smart and dont need them making basic decisions for us.

So youre saying SS would be fair only if you got out what you put in?? Sorry but Im not really seeing what your point is
Idk if you were trying to make a joke or not but are you sarcastically implying that SS is not earned by most of the people that receive it??
"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/01/medicare-and-social-security-what-you-paid-what-yo/ &gt; According to the institute?s data, a two-earner couple receiving an average wage ? $44,600 per spouse in 2012 dollars ? and turning 65 in 2010 would have paid $722,000 into Social Security and Medicare and can be expected to take out $966,000 in benefits. So, this couple will be paid about one-third more in benefits than they paid in taxes. &gt; . A couple with only one spouse working (and receiving the same average wage) would have paid in $361,000 if they turned 65 in 2010, but can expect to get back $854,000 BTW I was not trying to imply SS isnt earned, but on average you do get more than you pay into it. I 100% support it tho because the average earner deserves to retire and have some safety net. If you assume the amount you get out vs what you pay in as interest.. 33% isnt exactly great vs a standard 401k so I still think it is a good deal being virtually safe (except if the republicans get to disband it and you are below the cutoff age).

He will never miss a holiday, a birthday, anything against his will. he will never break his back on duty. he will never blow out a knew on a long march. He will never work 20+ hour days for 6months to a year for far less than minimum wage. Ryan, and his ilk on the left right and center, can shove it right up their asses. He can take his expensively manicured hands and hair and fuck himself with them. Please pardon my language but strong language is specifically designed for strong emotions.

"That no longer makes one a maverick, it makes one a RINO, or in some parts, a traitor. "
"The definition of maverick has changed. McCain used it as a ploy to attract mainstream voters and sugar coat his right-wing record. However, to be fair, all it takes to be labeled a maverick in todays republican party is to disagree with party leadership on about 1 out of 6 votes. "
"It may have changed, but so have many of his positions. I used to really like the guy. "
I cannot think of the word maverick without simultaneously thinking of Palin. And I also cannot assess a maverick without putting it on an imaginary scale of how mavericky something is.

There are two alternatives: Those that provided evidence lied to save their skins (Google Softball) or the WMDs in question went to Syria for safe-keeping. I was an Intelligence Analyst - I can assure you that eight or more aircraft and several convoys went from Iraq to Syria just prior to and at the beginning of the war. It could have been beetroot and curry. Or maybe it was something else. Who knows? But Syrian wasnt known to have a chemical weapons program, but now has chemical weapons.

"&gt; Seriously? Every nation agreed that there were WMDs in Iraq. History doesnt change to fit your narrative. Dont you remember coalition of the willing and Hans Blix saying that they need more time? The reason they didnt find WMDs in Iraq was because they werent there, because Saddam destroyed them back in the 90s. And every nation except Britain and the US - almost forgot Poland there, silly me - knew that the war was a lie. Thats why NATO refused to commit troops.

Thanks repubes. That kind of action should guarantee the Senate stays in Democratic hands.
"Supporters of the bill, called the Paycheck Fairness Act, say it would bring transparency to worker pay by making it illegal for employers to penalize employees who discuss their salaries and by requiring the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect pay information from employers.

Now theyve shot down making it illegal for bosses to penalize employees for discussing their salary, as well as effectively making it impossible to study the problem by refusing to allow data to be gathered. Its just more screeching insanity from the right in place of thoughtful discussion about policy. Nobody denies the wage gap exists, at best the right disagrees with how its being liberally measured by the left. All parties admit that there is a persistent wage gap; one side simply wants to chalk that up to all that free time off women get for having babies. No, Im not kidding. That is how the right tends to explain away the persistent gap in mens and womens incomes. Women make less because they work less, and they work less because they have the babies and were like the only major country that does not give paid time off for such. In America, squeezing another human out your vag counts as leisure activity to some folks. Pay attention, ladies. This is what is at stake in 2014."

No such thing as a pay gap. Only a labor gap What democrats want to do is pay women more than men so them working less brings home the same amount of money. Which is retarded

ah....a sizable portion of that percentage earns NO income -- hence no income taxes wait...wait...I know....Im sorry to have replied with actual information rather than a meaningless sound bite....please continue spewing your fact free nonsense 
"&gt; Except thats not true, and you have no source for it yes it is true According to the Tax Policy Center, about half of those who owe no federal income tax are people whose incomes are so low that when standard income tax provisions ? personal exemptions for taxpayers and dependents and the standard deduction ? are factored in, that simply leaves no income to be taxed. Those are people who earned less than about $27,000 Meaning that the other half that paid no fed. taxes, did so because their earnings were so low. Another sizable portion paid no federal taxes because they earned no income -- as in a stay at home mother who files jointly w/ her husband wait...wait...i know...no fair actually thinking about how taxes are filed Source: your own source - Tax Policy Center "
"Except thats not true, and you have no source for it (as it isnt true). &gt;Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which found that in 2011, 46 percent of tax filers paid no income tax, vs. about 54 percent of tax filers that did have some federal income tax liability.

how many wage concessions have they made over the years? And why have they made those concessions?
Dont know and dont know. That would be awesome discussion material if you know it. [This says](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/13/spencer-bachus/big-three-wages-inflated/) line workers (normally the lowest paid) earn $29.49 in todays dollars with the [total cost of wages and benefits](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-18/mbdlhh0yhq0x.html) at about $59/hour. So I think its safe to say we can still compete while paying living wages.
"&gt; No, thats federal money that goes to the employees. Big difference, and should be weighted less. The employees are, in fact, citizens of that state. Not a big difference in terms of economic impact, unless the money is going to people who are so wealthy they have a low marginal rate of consumption. &gt; What does that have to do with anything. Last I checked we were talking about places where federal tax dollars go."
"It should be weighed equally because thats money that goes from the Federal budget to the states, I imagine, and benefits the states just as much as any welfare payment. This is particularly notable in the case of Texas because it has so many prominent military bases that spend a very great deal of money. How much of the Texas Miracle (which frankly isnt even particularly miraculous) is simply due to Department of Defense spending? Its hard to say if you arent counting it in your figures."

That being said, what does that have to do with Miss, New Mexico, and the rest of them?"

"&gt; This is politics 101 in our democracy. The three political maxims, from Immanuel Kant, Perpetual Peace, Appendix I: 1. Fac et excusa (lat.: Do it and then make an excuse): Instead of going through a process with debate, transparency and thus opposition, do it and then make and excuse. 2. Si fecisti, nega (lat: If youve done it, deny it): Shift the blame and/or deny until over. 3. Divide et impera (lat.: Divide, so you rule): Build a compartmentalized hierarchical framework only you can fully oversee. This was published in 1795 and I know, that Ive read about rule three in texts from Cicero and G.I. Caesar, so its at least 2000 years old. It has always been power 101. "
Deliver nothing? Obama has broken only 22% of his promises. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/ 
"No one really gives a rats ass about most of those issues. Obama was elected on the primary basis of changing the governments transparency, restoring hope in our economy and government, and basically undoing the mess GW Bush created with his patriot act, Iraq war lies, NSA spying and failing Afghanistan strategy. He has done the exact opposite and has only pushed GW Bushs agenda further down the road."
"If you wish to be a success in the world, promise everything, deliver nothing. -Napoleon Bonaparte This is politics 101 in our democracy. You only need to pretend to deliver until you are reelected for a second term and accountable to no one. Obama is a great politician and a smart man, however, we need to realize that the president is not there to protect our rights. Only we as the mob can assert our rights by power."
"&gt;This is politics 101 in ~~our~~ any democracy. This is why we were not established as a - [and our founders rightfully distrusted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmM7AhKNawE) - democracy. The point should not be mob rule... the point should be that the rights of the citizenry are paramount, and cannot be taken away simply because 51% wish them to be. "

"This I feel is something that has changed a lot over the last 20 years. I worked at McDonalds when I was 15...there were virtually no adults working there save for the manager and maybe one other person...it was all teenagers or maybe 21 and under. Now, when I go to fast food restaurants, it is rarely kids...it seems to always be older people. I dont know if this is a sign of the economy/wages where more older people cant find better paying jobs...or what it is I guess...just definitely something that I have seen as a change."
This guy is the poster boy for exactly whats wrong with America.
"&gt;?Did you ever go into a McDonald?s or Burger King?? he said. ?I don?t really eat there, but they don?t seem desperate and hungry to me. They?re young kids, they seem to be enjoying themselves mostly.? This is such nonsense that constantly gets repeated. There a plenty of older people working in fast food."
"Courtesy of the recession, the median age of fast food workers [is now 28](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/08/28/trying-to-raise-a-family-on-a-fast-food-salary/). But Ill bite. If youre worth what youre worth, and retarded people are worth very little, all I ask is that CEOs be treated fairly and equally. Did you run company that lost money, like the banks that needed taxpayer bailouts, the former execs of the big three auto manufacturers, or the countless once-great companies who have been purchased, had their employees fired, production outsourced, and become shells of the companies they once were? The value you created for those companies is in the **negative** billions of dollars. If youre worth what youre worth, Id like to propose that youre worth negative billions of dollars, and you should be responsible for the debt incurred by the company you ran. Perhaps all of your worldly assets could be seized to pay for your destruction? "
"In well off areas there are rarely people who arent kids working in fast-food, and the people who have a need to say something like this are generally going to be wealthy so they could actually just believe thats how things are everywhere."
"I dont understand the reasoning there. Even if they were all young people, why should we pay them any less? They still have bills and loans to pay. Just because theyre having fun at their job doesnt mean that the wage is automatically a fair one. Their age or level of fun isnt relevant to a debate about minimum wage."
I dont really eat there Proceeds to give his opinion on the subject of who works there.
"&gt; There a plenty of older people working in fast food. Former BK crew member, and current fat ass. yes, there are plenty of older people and mentally handicapped people working there. The older folks were generally crew/shift leaders or managers and actually made a decent pay (28-35k/yr). The mentally handicapped people generally got paid shit. Which is a shame because they were by far the best workers. Seriously they never complained, they did their job well, were always friendly. Loved the 3 or 4 we had at bk when i was there. // note: no one was all that happy to be working there. "
The average age used to be 19. That was a decade ago. Now the average age is 29. These free market people are stuck on the notion that only teenagers are working fast food jobs. The free trade agreements that people like Schiff (who should change his name to Schill) support have caused the exodus of good paying jobs to third world countries. So now instead of a manufacturing job adults are flipping burgers or bagging groceries.
&gt;They?re young kids... Who might want to go to college without having to take out student loans with insane interest rates from his financial sector buddies. What a moron.
The biggest nonsense you can say about someone who suggests that fast food minimum wage jobs are only for young people and teenagers is that these businesses typically operate 18 hours a day. Whose staffing these places when the teenagers are in school? Whose working at Wal-mart 3rd shift shocking shelves? Not kids.
"If employees appeared hungry, desperate and unhappy they would be out of work. "
"Here in Colorado, were giving our elderly jobs trimming weed sitting down at a nice table. Truly a silver lining...."

It always breaks my heart seeing a senior working in fast food. I wish all seniors could be retired comfortably and enjoying their golden years.
"In LA, almost everyone that I see working fast food is a middle-aged hispanic woman."
"Have these people never actually worked such jobs? (Never mind, I think I answered my question already.) Ive never met such a pile of miserable people in my life. Its awful."
"&gt; There a plenty of older people working in fast food. And even if they _were_ all young, that isnt a good reason to take advantage of them."
&gt; This is such nonsense that constantly gets repeated. There a plenty of older people working in fast food. Absolutely agree. Old people without high school diplomas or college degrees. Why should they made $10-15 an hour? You guys are truly delusional if you think the COLA wouldnt increase right along with the minimum wage prices.
"I dont really eat there and I dont know what Im talking about, but let me talk about it anyway."
You ever go to a Congressional hearing? Nobody there is working and they look miserable. We should fix that.
Few teenagers work there anymore. Why would you hire a 16 year old who doesnt want to work when you could hire a poor desperate-for-rent 20 year old with no school obligations?
http://thefederalist.com/2014/01/28/11-facts-about-the-minimum-wage-that-president-obama-forgot-to-mention-during-the-state-of-the-union/ The majority of minimum wage workers are either high school or college age kids. 
"I recall yelling at my TV in an attempt at a counter-argument when I saw this segment. What actually came out was a string of incoherent sounds. Afterwards, I determined it was just as good a counter-argument as any."
"[Stats:](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/fast-food-workers-2013-08.pdf) Summary: 60.7% of fast-food workers are &lt;24. Not all teenagers (not close), but certainly a lot. "
"Even still...part of your job while working there is to seem happy and friendly. No one can say welcome to Wendys, this blows ass. What do you want and keep their job. "
I worked at BK through high school and college. Many coworkers were older and a few elderly who didnt really have anywhere else to go. Just trying to get by the best they could two weeks at a time. It hurts knowing most of America lives paycheck to paycheck. But a lot of folks wouldnt have to if they would act their WAGE. The world is about status and looks so it makes everything a competition. Were fed materialistic crap that we buy to impress people we dont even really like. Then a lot of those same people cry because they dont get paid enough. I understand some people have legitimate problems getting ahead and I respect them for doing everything they can. But sometimes the world and especially this country need to realize that they wouldnt be in such a bind if they stopped worrying about everyone elses opinion. 
I believe the latest statistic is well under half of fast food workers are teens. Much more than half are older citizens. 
A slave owners blood runs strong in this guy. 
the older people dont work the counters or the kitchen that you can see over the counter
Here there are what appears to be outdated software engineers operating the cash register at McDonalds.
" Outside of large cities, most fast food work is teenagers. The problem is not how low a part-time job wage is, but how many people are trying to live on part-time jobs. But, the original point is accurate: You are worth (in salary terms) what you are worth."
"According to a resent study, he is 30% right.... (note: this is not my agreeing with him) Does anyone have a better source for this data?

Yes, we are well aware that Obama has lied to our face, but the difference is that Obamas lies did not cost America its credibility as a global leader and definitely did not kill thousands of innocent lives."
What lies of theirs started $2 trillion wars?
"Im all for calling people out for lying. But get back to me when these same loudmouths, many of you included, get angry at Obamas and Hillarys lies. Or do their lies not matter to you due to them being in your party?"

This is a very good point.

Regardless of what one thinks about Hugo Chavez this a great example of what would probably happen here if someone that the establishment hated was close to winning. This is how I knew that Obama was a big fat faker and Trojan horse. I didnt see any of the people or organizations that stood to lose billions if the status quo were threatened complaining about him. I judged the man by his enemies and not his words and I was the only one of my friends that didnt get fooled. Now I feel that I may have been fooled by Warren and am none to pleased.

"I was very pleased with Obama, and the insurance companies were not happy about Obamacare so much that the Republicans voted 27 times to have it removed and the 2008 Republican candidate swore to repeal it on his first-day.

&gt;Youre full of shit. I was ready to have a reasonable conversation with you up until you said this. I will not respond to you again.
"Your hope in Warren comes from necessity. You want to believe shell live up to her hype. Just as others wanted to believe in Obama. Because when you take away hope, theres nothing left but a gut-wrenching void. No one can fault you for it. We all end up hoping, even if its unlikely anything will come of it. Which is precisely why modern politics is structured the way that it is. As long as the public buys into the perception there will be change, real change remains illusive."

The author did as much fact checking as Fox News. 
Its almost like a random internet magazine didnt do their research / just lied through their teeth.
"Good point, its a shitty article if they thought that was a real quote. On the other hand, Ashcroft did spend thousands of the taxpayers money for purple drapes to hang in front the statue of Justice in the Justice Department because the sight of one aluminum tit on a statue that had been there since before he was born offended his delicate sensibilities. The author could have come up with dozens of real quotes that would also illustrate what a POS he is."
This is about the quality of reporting that I expect from ANY partisan news source
"FTA: &gt; ?I feel the best way to ensure Americans? freedom is to tighten restrictions on that freedom in any way possible. Only through wiretaps, illegal searches and seizures, unfettered government intrusion, a controlled media and a complete crackdown on free speech can we ensure the liberties of all people.? ? Attorney General John Ashcroft Uhh yeah. That was a quote from an SNL skit about Ashcroft, not Ashcroft himself. Edit: There may not have been an SNL skit (the Snopes comment may not be accurate) but theres no evidence that Ashcroft said this, and its clearly parody no matter the source."
"While I dont believe the quote is legit, I dont believe its from SNL either. I googled it (as I expect you did) and found [this Snopes forum post](http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=25290) where someone said they thought it was from an SNL sketch, but [the clip he linked to](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BKbMkP_XEw) doesnt have that quote, nor does it appear in the [full transcript of that sketch I found](http://snltranscripts.jt.org/02/02chardball.phtml). Do you know what sketch its actually from? Because all I could find about it was a bunch of left-leaning Top 20 dumbest Republican quote lists and the like..."

That doesnt dismiss the other quotes or the entire point of the article. 
The author is as clueless towards satire as the conservatives are. Wow.
Yeah that line was way too ridiculous for someone of Ashcrofts status to have said. I cant believe the author missed that.
Youre absolutely right. I googled the quote and found the Snopes page. I didnt follow up to the linked video.
"That quote was obviously bullshit, I didnt even have to fact check it. The Attorney General advocating illegal searches and seizures? That doesnt even make sense."
I tried finding the original and could not even find it as an SNL quote. Do you have a link to the sketch?

"The FCC is a independent regulatory body. While it is under the executive branch, Obama does not have complete control over it as he does with other executive agencies that are not independent. FCC Commissioners can only be removed for cause, whereas other heads of executive agencies can be fired at any time because they serve at the pleasure of the President."

"Do phone calls, emails, and letters even work? Thats what everyone always seems to suggest, but doesnt it take something a little more erm, violent, to enact lasting change? "
"That wont change a thing. Why would Obama give a shit? He supported ACTA and SOPA for fucks sake. His political career is basically over in a couple years when he walks out the door and he clearly doesnt care about his legacy. No politician in position to help is willing to help. Honestly, our country is too damn corrupt to go through the proper channels. Wed need to make the lives of these people miserable to see change, but nobody will do that because that would require action. We need either more Edward Snowden-esque people or someone/thing willing to physically or financially (Google) intimidate these institutions. Being an armchair activist wont change anything regarding this and people need to quit thinking that a few emails or phone calls will reverse any ruling that involves net neutrality. "
How can we help? 
"He is a corporate apparatchik, though. At least, thats what his current lack of action on so many things would suggest."
"No. We need to actually show up in person for this one, at the doorstep of these attorneys."
There is only one way to purge the FCC and democracy has nothing to do with it.

"&gt;Did you know that 96 percent of all U.S. businesses are specifically exempted from Obamacares employer responsibilities? Yes. &gt;We dont have to provide coverage and we dont pay any penalties.

How is it lowering costs exactly? The tax credit doesnt cover all the costs of paying for your employees health care coverage.

Yep. No employer is going to have part timers work over 25 hours a week. 25 hours might as well be the new cutoff between part time and full time. 
Money paid to bureaucrats doesnt just disappear.
My point of ignoring taxation and bureaucratic costs remains valid. 
"&gt; Food stamp money is re-spend more in the U.S. (on average) before it goes overseas or into savings and thus it is better government spending Savings provides capital for investment. You cant expand production without investment, so spending is not what drives the economy. &gt;The USDA says the Food Stamp multipier is 1.79 meaning $10 dollars in spending provides $17.90 in stimulus - not great, but better than many other programs. The government entity whose budget is determined by the success of its programs claims its programs are successful."
"&gt; Are food stamps effective? -economists say food stamps have a high multiplier i.e. the money is re-spent before it leaks out of the country. That ignores the source of funding. Theres the claim that a dollar spent on food stamps yields a $1.73 in the economy, but that dollar didnt come from nowhere. It came from taxes(and borrowing/printing is taxation too, just delayed taxation), and theres a bureaucratic cost to distributing that dollar. So, lets say theres a 30% tax rate and you need $1.25 to spend a dollar due bureaucratic cost(some evidence suggests its higher than that, but whatever). So you took $1.25 out of the economy in taxes and got back .3*1.73, or 0.52. Youve created a loss."
"&gt; Youre assuming $1 dollar is removed from the economy via taxation No, Im assuming more than a dollar is removed for each dollar spent because of bureaucratic costs. Printing and borrowing are ultimately taxation as well, just delayed taxation. &gt;Your equation would essentially mean that any use of money by the government inherently is chipping away at the economy absent of a 300%+ return in identifiable tax revenue The subjective theory of value requires voluntary trade to create wealth. Since this isnt voluntary, you cant actually say youre creating wealth. &gt;Youre comparing the tax revenue required for funding to the money returned via taxation from spending. Not only is this a fundamental misunderstanding of what an economic multiplier actually is(or is useful for) and how it is applied to food stamp benefits compared to the lost business revenue, Im not misunderstanding it. Im *criticizing* it. &gt; but you manage to mislabel the Food and Nutrition Service as some form of bloated beauracratic waste while in reality it is one of the most efficient federal programs in terms of benefits to administrative costs ratio There is more to the bureaucracy than just the spending portion. Theres the collection and transfer and taxes as well. &gt;Even if you consider fraudulent gains of benefits, meaning people are receiving a benefit they do should not be eligible to receive, or the even less common selling/trading etc., that money is still positively impacting the economy due to the inherent velocity of the benefits compared to other economic activity. Only by ignoring where the money came from. Taking money from one place then putting it somewhere else at a nonzero cost by force doesnt create wealth, unless you create an equation that ignores numerous aspects of reality. "
"&gt;&gt; lets say theres a 30% tax rate The taxing definately has a negative economic impact. But what I was discussing was forms of government spending. Food stamp money is re-spend more in the U.S. (on average) before it goes overseas or into savings and thus it is better government spending. The USDA says the Food Stamp multipier is 1.79 meaning $10 dollars in spending provides $17.90 in stimulus - not great, but better than many other programs. "
"What...? Youre assuming $1 dollar is removed from the economy via taxation. That taxation leads to $1.73 in economic activity. There is a net gain in spending of money over the absence of taxation, despite taxation removing that money from economy to fund the program. In actuality this method of removing money from the economy is also false, since you cant consider an individual tax dollar and program spending is simultaneous to revenue, but thats beyond the point. Youre comparing the tax revenue required for funding to the money returned via taxation from spending. Not only is this a fundamental misunderstanding of what an economic multiplier actually is(or is useful for) and how it is applied to food stamp benefits compared to the lost business revenue, but you manage to mislabel the Food and Nutrition Service as some form of bloated beauracratic waste while in reality it is one of the most efficient federal programs in terms of benefits to administrative costs ratio. [Some info is found here, debunking lies from Michelle Bachmann](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/19/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-70-percent-food-stamp-fundin/) Furthermore, the end result of the program isnt only concerning tax receipts, but national economic health as a whole. The program is providing benefits exhibiting enhanced monetary velocity which has further reaching implications than your simplified equation purports, from immediate employment levels despite losses in revenues due to taxation, health of program enrollees, crime levels, the list goes on and on. You will be hard pressed to find a program more worth its weight in the federal government, and imagining that it must have some immediate and simple deficit-neutral budget impact is absurd even if you consider the incorrect assumption and math you use in your post. Your equation would essentially mean that any use of money by the government inherently is chipping away at the economy absent of a 300%+ return in identifiable tax revenue, which is actually a common but completely baseless argument against federal spending in efficient programs. If anything SNAP is too restrictive in its enrollment, the only major complaint that has basis in reality since the program is limited in the actual impact of fraudulent behavior. Even if you consider fraudulent gains of benefits, meaning people are receiving a benefit they do should not be eligible to receive, or the even less common selling/trading etc., that money is still positively impacting the economy due to the inherent velocity of the benefits compared to other economic activity."
Thats some fail math there.
the republicans in congress represent republican voters and donors. that is how they got there and that is how they stay there. you just made their case to continue the stubborn shutdown. ps - obama endorsed the obamacare lingo.
"&gt;the republicans in congress represent republican voters and donors. that is how they got there and that is how they stay there. you just made their case to continue the stubborn shutdown. Soooo, you are defending vilification and intentionally misleading constituents. Go ahead and cite a Democrat doing it if you can because Im sure they are out there, but there is a whole laundry list of Republicans who have intentionally misled the public to have an aide backtrack for them. Problem with that strategy is that it works.

I like how you put endorsed in quotes. That is quite accurate. It is used as a derisive term but has also become ubiquitous. There have been a number of polls asking the same questions about the legislation and when it is refered to as Obamacare it gets negative reviews where as the ACA gets primarily postive feedback. If Im making the argument for the Republicans then I am endorsing ignorance. However, I am not. Also, please disregard the man on the street polls that both sides are doing. They are specifically edited to reflect the goals of the poster. However there are a number of legitimate studies. "

"&gt;Key Measurables of Success - IMHO: &gt;* Significant decrease in bankruptcies caused by Medical bill debt * Preventive care leading to less Short Term and Long Term disability in the workforce * More solvent insurance portfolios - leading to a slowed rate of growth in premium costs * Reduction in the number of disabled people, relying on SNAP and other assistance programs, due to untreated conditions like torn ACLs, rotator cuffs, etc... because they were able to receive proper treatment and rehab * Overall increase in workforce efficiency, something large and small business owners should love! &gt;These are all long term. With the exception of the folks that havent had insurance but now do, I dont see how either side of the issue can claim Success or Failure now, or in the immediate future. These are the *goals*. Ostensibly. The reality is that this legislation, and especially this administrations selective enforcement and nonchalance in illegally changing the requirements and exempting specific parties, has resulted in: A) fewer Americans actually being covered than before its passage due to the dropping of insurance plans B) less coverage for more money C) the removal or reduction of hundreds of thousands of full time positions D) a health insurance industry that is defunct due to its inability to keep up with near monthly changes in requirements E) the inability of many small businesses being able to maintain profit margins and meet legal requirements while remaining competitive vs. larger corporations. Thats far from all its done either."

"Popular votes are mostly irrelevant, because that doesnt decide the winner of the election, the Electoral College does. Heavily-populated states are outweighed on a per-voter basis by less-populated states. The voters of Wyoming have more say, per capita, in the election than the voters of New York or California. "
"Yeah, and I think that instead of picking a likeable candidate, theyre going to pick Hillary, and this will seal their demise. The voters in both parties already have a terrible history of picking the shittiest candidates possible during the primaries, and passing over the better ones. "
"&gt;The first serious woman candidate will excite the hell out of the electorate btw. Youve got to be kidding. No one likes Hillary except the Obamabot crowd. The right-leaning voters certainly dont, and even many of the left-leaning voters dont trust her. If another serious woman candidate came around (Elizabeth Warren perhaps, she seems to be fairly well-liked and not despised like Hillary) and got the nomination, then I could see that happening. But this is unlikely to happen. My prediction is that Hilary will win the Dem nomination because of some Dem voters and the Dem leadership believing as you do (the first serious woman candidate!!!!), and then shes going to lose the general election because only Obama-lovers and the like actually like her, and everyone else either distrusts her or despises her. The right-leaners will vote for whoever runs on the other side, and the progressives will be so disillusioned after 8 years of Obamas BS, and will see that Hillary will be even worse than Obama, so they wont bother to show up. I know I wont. Ill just send in a vote for the Green party. &gt;Based on the enormous unpopularity of the republican party According to your preferred news sources, perhaps. From what I see, theres a lot of support for the Reps and even the Tea Party out there. Fox News didnt get where it is for nothing. I predict people like you are going to get a real reality check when a Republican is elected in 2016, and things in this country go from worse to even worse over the next 8 years. "
&gt; Maybe well get lucky and get a Republican like Nixon. We call those Democrats now.
"&gt; o it seems unlikely that Biden will be elected in 2016, or that any other Dem will; the voters just arent very excited by them. The first serious woman candidate will excite the hell out of the electorate btw. Also GHW was voted out by his own party for raising taxes. Based on the enormous unpopularity of the republican party and the demographic changes that keep chugging along (electorate will be 4-5 points less white in 2016 compared to 2012 and 8-10 points less white in 2020) Hillary has a HUGE chance of win AND be reelected. The whole point of 2012 was that the traditional model is now gone. The Nixon-Regan southern strategy is dead and the repubs. are basically screwed until they moderate which they show no signs of doing. "
Thats one of the reasons I think Hillary is the only Democrat who could win it for them.
"I think we can look forward to a Republican President in 2016. The reason is simple: we have a Democrat Pres right now. They tend to alternate. Were getting 8 years of Obama (D); before that, we had 8 years of W (R). Before that, we had 8 years of Clinton (D). Before that, we had 4 years of HW (R), and 8 years of Reagan (R) (so there was a break in the pattern there). Before that, 4 years of Carter (D), 8 years of Nixon/Ford (R), 8 years of JFK/LBJ (D), etc. Basically, we keep getting two terms of one party, then switch to two terms for the other party. The only exceptions are if someone is really unpopular, usually because of a lousy economy (Carter, HW), or if someone is really really popular but term-limited their Vice will get elected (HW). Of course, several of these 8-year terms are shared (JFK/LBJ, Nixon/Ford) because of the first guy dying or resigning and his VP taking over. In one case, the VP was re-elected but was so unpopular he didnt bother running for re-election after that, and in the other case the VP lost his only re-election bid. Obama is not really really popular by any stretch, in fact his approval ratings are pretty lousy, which is shameful considering how popular he was in 2008. So it seems unlikely that Biden will be elected in 2016, or that any other Dem will; the voters just arent very excited by them. This doesnt mean theyre all going to switch sides and vote Republican, but instead many will just stay home. The Republican voters instead will turn out in high enough numbers (because theyre sick of Democrat policies, and actually believe all the stuff the Republican politicians tell them), and a Republican president will be elected. Hopefully itll be a more moderate one; perhaps even Rick Perry, who recently said something in support of allowing carmakers to sell directly to customers, something that most Republicans are against (despite all their free market!!! rhetoric), and which I dont hear much from Democrats about either. You never know though; people could get angry enough to vote for some third party, and we might end up with a Green president. Dont count on it though; the last time we had a President from a new party elected was in the early 1800s when the Whigs fell by the wayside. Maybe well get lucky and get a Republican like Nixon. That would be much better than Obama; wed get far more progressive policies. From Wikipedia: Although Nixon initially escalated Americas involvement in the Vietnam War, he subsequently ended U.S. involvement by 1973. Nixons visit to the Peoples Republic of China in 1972 opened communications between the two nations and eventually led to the normalization of diplomatic relations. He initiated d?tente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. Domestically, his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from Washington to the states. Among other things, he launched initiatives to fight cancer and illegal drugs, imposed wage and price controls, enforced desegregation of Southern schools, implemented environmental reforms, and introduced legislation to reform healthcare and welfare. Though he presided over the lunar landings beginning with Apollo 11, he replaced manned space exploration with shuttle missions. His policies sound far more progressive than Obamas. "
Actually Democrats have won 5 of the last 6 popular votes in presidential elections - so theres your pattern right there. And Hillary Clintons early polling numbers make her a good bet to make it 6 out of 7.
"Democrats have a electoral advantage, already starting with enough votes to win the presidency counting only the states that voted Democrat in the last 6 elections consistently. http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/10/george-will/george-will-paints-dire-electoral-picture-gop-says/ That goes a long way, all theyd need is a candidate that could be likable enough to attract voters and its a done deal. Then again, the political environment may be way different by the time 2016 rolls around, who knows."

In that case you should side with Obama http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/
Who do you view as being the most honest leader?
I think you want the impossible.
Cant trust the current lair in chief.
You can keep your feckless lying president.
"So with Obamas 22% promise broken rate, you are pretty safe--in betting terms--when trusting Obama"
Honest leaders are the best. Lying leaders suck.
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/
"So, Obama is feckless. Obama has not kept his promise to protect net neutrality. Obama is still Liar-in-Chief. Obama has a disapproval rating on par with Nixon."
What do you expect from our feckless Liar-in-Chief?
"Well to be fair, the left wing has radical feminists and new age anti-vaccination hippie types, eco-warriors etc. But I suppose left-wing right-wing is an overly simplistic model of politics. Hell, its downright misleading."
"Hey go ahead and include yourself on the ignorant list. Im so far from a republican that its not funny...however...Sarah Palin never said that she could see Russia from her porch..that was Tina Fey on SNL...Palin said there is an island here in Alaska where you can see Russia from the shore and that TRUE. In a speech about foreign policy dealing with Russia. Also Im going to go ahead and guess that you fall in the 25 and under group of Americans who for some reason have grown up to really despise their own country and people. Always willing to cast aspersions on their own country and people while not comprehending that the entire fucking World is filled with humans who are quite similar in intellect. The total disdain for Right wingers,conservatives,republicans is another ridiculous notion that your generation seems stuck on. Falling for the divide and control trap set up by the rich and corporations. Believe it or not there are plenty stupid assholes with left leaning ideas..just as many as the idiots with unwavering right leaning ideas....and the politicians left or right ALL work against our interests. Keep up with the ignorant selfish idiocy. Keep disparaging your own country and people and glorifying the rest of the World where by and large life is far worse than here. Keep taking retarded left/right stances and insulting the other side while your rights, freedom, and money are all stolen from your dumb ass."
"You are correct, and I apologize for the error. Given the large number of truly stupid things Sarah Palin has said, its easy to forget that I can see Russia from my house wasnt one of them. It is true that you can stand on a chunk of rock thats technically part of Alaska, way out in the Bering Sea, and from 37 miles away, if the weather is perfectly clear, you can see bit of an uninhabited part of Siberia. To imply that this in any way gives you a greater understanding of Russia is ridiculous, at best. Some other dumb things Palin actually said: He who warned, uh, the British that they werent gonna be takin away our arms, uh, by ringing those bells, and um, makin sure as hes riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that we were going to be sure and we were going to be free, and we were going to be armed. In re: Paul Revere, since she evidently didnt remember he supposedly said The British are coming, which I doubt hed need to tell the British. But obviously, weve got to stand with our North Korean allies. In re: what the U.S. should do about tensions between North and South Korea. Too bad she cant see Korea from Alaska, I guess. So, I think I might be forgiven for mistaking a stupid thing someone doing an impression of Palin said for a stupid thing she actually said. I do apologize for the error, though."
The difference is that everyone in AU thought Stephanie was a fucking moron while a sizable group of Americans thought Sarah Palin was the next coming of conservative leadership.
"The latest anti-vaccination fiasco involved a right-wing Christian church in Texas, whose stance against measles vaccines led to the first measles outbreak in the United States in over a decade. Anti-vaccination delusionalism isnt confined to, or even associated with, a particular political stance. Eco-warriors? Radical feminism? Defending a sustainable ecological balance or opposing gender-based privilege are not signs of low intelligence, whether you agree with them or not. Stupid is not a term that means I disagree with this. But, yeah, anti-vaccination nuts are pulling an indefensibly dumb move."
"Actually, Im over 40, not that its any of your business. And loving my country doesnt mean forgiving the willful ignorance of its citizens. And I say, and mean, willful because we have access to so much information and education in this country. Being ignorant of basic geography, history, etc. in America is either a lazy mistake (like the one I made not double-checking the Sarah Palin reference, which I am truly embarrassed about) or a deliberate disdain of knowledge. I have disdain for willful ignorance and deliberate delusion. It seems to me that there are more examples of that on the right than the left, though Ill concede confirmation bias could be shading my perceptions there. Young earth creationists, Tea Party anti-government zealots collecting Social Security, the overwhelming majority of Republican Presidential candidates in 2012 stating they dont believe in the validity of the theory of evolution. I could go on and on. I have heard mind-bendingly stupid things on the left, too. I remember talking to a black minister who is a local civil rights leader of long standing, hearing him spout off several homophobic sentiments, and asking him if he shouldnt oppose all forms of prejudice. He just looked at me and, completely sincerely, said, Im not prejudiced. Prejudice is hating black people! No part of the political spectrum has a monopoly on ignorance. It does seem to me that one end of it seems to be welcoming and encouraging it currently in the U.S., though."
&gt;We had Sarah I can see Russia from my house Palin No we didnt. When are people going to stop crediting Palin for this fucking quote? Tina Fey said that on SNL as Palin. http://www.snopes.com/politics/palin/seealaska.asp
"&gt; As an Australian its been my experience that many Americans (and an increasing number of right wing Aussies) dont know the difference between social democracy, socialism and communism. As an American, its been my experience that you can end the phrase many Americans dont know the difference between with a huge array of things and still have it be true. Sad, but true. Right-wingers seem to be fairly stump-dumb worldwide, though. We had Sarah I can see Russia from my house Palin, you had Stepanie Im not opposed to Islam as a country Bannister. Between them, they have herped a world-spanning amount of derps. Edit: Tina Fey, impersonating Sarah Palin, said I can see Russia from my house. It was a shorthand parody of Sarah Palin saying that it was possible to see Russia from Alaska in response to a question about her lack of foreign policy experience. Technically, on a perfectly clear day, with binoculars, from a rocky island in the middle of the Bering Sea thats considered part of Alaska, you *can* see some bits of an uninhabited part of Siberia 37 miles away. I apologize for the misquote."
"Yeah. About that Debt Ceiling. See that big gap after the 1980s? A thing called the Gephardt Rule raised the debt ceiling automatically when Congress passed spending. No muss, no fuss, no threats, no posturing, no deadlines, just functioning government. Who removed that rule? Newt Gingrich and House Republicans."
"Even with the Gephardt Rule, you need to pass a budget to extend the debt ceiling. [Guess who hasnt done that in 4 years?](http://www.politifact.com/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/28/bob-corker/bob-corker-says-senate-has-not-passed-budget-more-/)"
"You are misremembering. There were no flights in US, but military ones (excepting a medical flight involving the delivery of snake anti-venom) until September 13th. Some of the bin Laden family left the US on a charter flight on September 19th. They were probably fleeing due to fears that dumbfuck Americans would try to lynch them. "
.
I remember it clearly. There was one civilian flight in the US on Sep 12. It was the evacuation of the bin Ladens.
Nope. Didnt happen. http://www.snopes.com/rumors/flights.asp
"&gt;I remember it clearly. There was one civilian flight in the US on Sep 12. It was the evacuation of the bin Ladens.

Many were terrified, fearing they could be lynched, after hearing news reports of sporadic violence against Muslims and Arab-Americans."
"this blows my mind, is this documented "
Politifact is owned by the Koch brothers
ITT: liberals twisting this in some way to make it seem like this isnt a simple fact that has been heard probably a hundred times on video.
Cancellations only affected a small % of people. All the NSA lies revealed by Snowden are what we should be focusing on.
How does this lie outweigh any of NSA revelations???
The real lie of the year is that this is the lie of the year. Politifact has been paid off by Koch shills and our feudal oil barons. Theyre bought out garbage and you cant trust a thing they say because they try to look so unbiased. Dont trust what they say unless its something bad about Republicans. 
"So Politifact notes that nothing in the new law prevents insurance companies from offering the same old plans indefinitely - that it was entirely their choice to cancel any plans they cancelled - and then calls Obamas statement a lie, as if he, and not insurers, was in any way responsible for the cancellation of plans. Okay."
"Politifact is garbage and this is just proof how bad it is getting. It was determined that there was in fact, a grandfather clause which allowed people to keep their healthcare plans. The problem was a select few insurance companies (you wont find competent providers offering these types of plans past the deadline after March 23, 2010) chose to continue to issue plans that did not meet the minimum criteria set forth by the ACA after the deadline were set. These were the poster-boy plans the media circus danced around. Basically just more manufactured problems from those trying to mentally justify their own preconceived biased beliefs. It is so easy to cherry pick ones version of reality when there is so much information to choose from."
What if you dont like it? I suppose thats the one they force you to have.
"Its horseshit, but its not quite as horseshit as last years Lie of the year. I understand the impulse - youve called pants on fire on Republicans day after day... after day... and you dont want to look biased for siding with reality, so you pick a mistaken assertion (in this case) or a debatable assertion (last years winner) and you trumpet it as proof of your non-bias. But theyll never love you because 364 days out of the year you call bullshit on bullshit. And they *hate* that. Because bullshit is all they have."

"http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/obamacare-s-unlikely-winners-20131217 Sue Spanke of Missoula, Mont., was highly displeased this fall when she learned her health insurance had been canceled....After angrily calling her state auditors office, Spanke, a self-employed artist in her 50s, found she was eligible for a federal subsidy. Her new insurance will cover her for a mere $30 to $40 a month with a deductible of only $500. She had been paying $350 a month for a Blue Cross policy with a $5,000 deductible. I went from a horrible policy that didnt cover anything, that was breaking me, to the best policy at the best price Ive had since I was in my 20s, she said. Finally, the reality is destroying the GOP myth about this. Lie of the year, my ass. "
Finally an award he actually earned.
"Bullshit. Democrats dont lie, they spy."
I can count on this subreddit to bury this article deep? very deep. 
"A year ago, politofact rated it true. Six months ago, mostly true, now its the lie of the year. Thats what happens when you base your case on talking points."
"So between the government shutdown of Ted Cruzs and the Obama administration lying about spying on Americans in numerous ways, this managed to be the pathetic right-pandering horseshit they thought mattered most? Politifact continues to be beyond worthless."

"Out of the multitude of lies told this year, even those by the Obama administration, I think this is not the lie of the year. Perhaps maybe the administrations attempt to say that the NSA was not spying on american citizens, or collecting cellphone data, or going after AP journalists to expose leaks, or about the drone programs, if they wanted to go the healthcare route, saying that the website for healthcare.gov would be fixed in a month... and these are just the ones with the Obama administration. There are plenty of lies out there, even ones put out by the Obama administration. To go after this seems a little weak and I think that if they wanted to focus on the white house in particular, there are *plenty* of other lies that could have been focused on that would have been much more beneficial to bring to the forefront than a lie that most people have already accepted as a lie and something that will generally be glossed over by the public at large. Again, if they really wanted to make an impact, they should have chosen something with a little less press coverage already because those who know it is/was a lie already know it is/was a lie, those who think it was a slip-up will continue to think that and those who have thought that the big bad government is out to kill them and their family will continue to think so. TL;DR: I could think of about 10 different lies, all by Obama, that Id rather have as the lie of the year than a story that has been run in the media many times already."
"Once it was Peg-the-Needle True. Now it?s Lie of the Year. And all it took was the merest exposure to reality. There are facts, and then there are PolitiFacts. "
Not even fucking close.
"For discussion: This article mentions that some radio talkshow hosts compare this lie to I am not a crook or I did not have sexual relations with that woman. But I dont think thats quite right. It seems to me more on par with Read my lips, no new taxes Thoughts?"
"Just goes to show Politifact is staffed by jackasses. They downgrade things to mostly true *when things are in fact even worse than the person claiming something was*. Which, to most of us, means extra true, not mostly true. As for this whole debacle - what has really happened with that statement is that the spirit of that is alive and well. The President may have said those words and been wrong, but if instead he had said ... you can keep it, unless it is so bad as to become illegal. In which case, you are guaranteed to get a new, better and cheaper plan explicitly it wouldnt have been a lie at all. And that is the reality today, people who lost their plans did so because the insurers - not the government, the *insurers* - cancelled them. And all the people who were taken off those plans can get *better and cheaper* plans now thanks to the ACA. Politifact is clearly staffed by babbling idiots who probably have issues tying their own shoelaces in the morning. Theyre not helping. Picking that as lie of the year is laughable."
How is this Lie of the Year over Nobody is listening to your phone calls
Politifact is such a joke any time they call a lie of the year spoken by a Democrat. They try *soo* hard to appear non-partisan/give equal airtime that it is embarassing. 
Politifacts Lie of the Year: that the president has direct control over the insurance companies internal decision making process.
"not to interrupt the political war but according to the polifact website the lie of year was determined by readers in a poll. We offered readers 10 finalists for the Lie of the Year for 2013. It?s the fifth year in a row we?ve asked readers to weigh in via an online poll. We received 14,278 votes this year, a record turnout. First place among readers overwhelmingly went to President Barack Obama, for his repeated statement, If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-readers-poll-results-2013/ So they arent pushing the lie of the year bit off as Fact. Its merely a popularity contest at its core"
Didnt he say this in 2012? 
"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/ Politifacts Lie of the Year 2013: If you like your health care plan, you can keep it "
The thing is: That is *exactly* what the republicans asked for and got. The insurance companies are the ones revoking the plans. 
2008s True Statement has becomes 2013s Lie of the Year RIP Politifact
"I think this is the biggest lie told by a majority of republican ever let alone 2013 - ?I, (name of Member), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign or domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.? "
"Obama fan or not, I dont understand how you can disagree with this: Obama knowingly lied about being able to keep our healthcare plans. Look, I get that some of these plans were shitty,skeletal,didnt have emergency care, etc. and those people are probably better off being turned to different and better plans. BUT thats not the promise Obama made, thats not the point he argued, and thats not the message he sent. He *could* have argued that during the election, but he didnt. He merely said, if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it. Id respect the White House a lot more if they just admitted their fuck up and moved on, rather than spinning the whole, I know what we said, but heres what we meant and youre better off anyway. Politifact is completely accurate on this one: bold-faced lie."
"Holy crap! An article in /r/politics which recognizes that Obama was a fraud is actually getting upvoted? What is this, opposite land?"
"Politifact: Romney lie of the year 2012. Top spot, front page with over 2200 upvotes. Politifact: Obama lie of the year 2013. Less than 150 up votes. Politifact is garbage anyway. And people wonder why this sub was delisted."
"This is Bullshit! The lie of the year was when my ex told me that he was just a friend. Where is my insurance against heartbreak Obama, WHERE IS IT!!!"
"yeah.. that was a fuck up... for a guy so good at talking you wouda figured hed have gotten that right. Obama fucked up his whole presidency with this. oh sure it is a legacy program and will someday prove invaluble to this country. but he let congress fuck arouund with iit for way too long with the stupid gang of six, each one of whiich was worse than the other. then the insurance companies wrote the law and he kowtowed to the republicans making multiiple changes to attract their votes and they just kept stringing him along until flipping him the bird. and he pushed away his allies and let the tea party funded by koch domiinate the summer recess. and then god damn pelosi. who really is a good leader, had to say she had to wait for the senate to pass the final version to see whats in it. omfg we wiill never.see.the end of that. oh well...still no death panels though."
Politifact is a pretty terrible organization though. They routinely label things partially true or mostly false that are really true or false. They do this to say see were fair to both sides and continue to say both sides are equal in terms of lying about the other sides position.
Wow. Im always amazed at the amount of bullshit on Reddit trying to defend Obama on this one. Whatever helps you sleep at night I guess. 
"To be fair, its better than Some of you are eating a big fat shit sandwich from the insurance companies and loving it, and you will be forced to stop paying for your shitty plans that youd know were a joke if you were smart enough to read the fine print, and instead you will have to choose a plan that actually provides medical coverage."
Politifact: Still not good at picking lies.
"... Unless your plan is really, really shitty. "
"its always the same thing in politics. its never the crime that gets you, its the cover-up. obama said what he said. whether he thought it was true or not, the reason people got dropped was not directly caused by the ACA. if he would have just explained it that way it wouldnt have been so bad. but then came the backtrack, and the what we really said was comments. now it looks like a cover-up and everyone gets pissed. should have just owned it and moved on."
I think to call plans that could lead you into bankruptcy in the event of a major accident or ill eat insurance is the lie of the century.
"Under the reforms we seek, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan Barack Obama, August 8th, 2009 He said this before the law was passed and explicitly said under the reforms we seek. Is there another example of him saying this after the law was passed? I am seriously confused how this is being construed as a lie. I want someone that doesnt believe in death panels or deny Obamas birth certificate to respond with how this is a lie."
"Obama made the mistake of lying, in a case where the lie would be very clear, and harmful to people. Most politicians lies dont have this level of impact on peoples lives. It now appears that on Jan 1 more people will have their insurance cancelled then will have gotten insurance via ACA - in other words, the number of insured people will go down due to ACA. Holy shit!"
"I think the underlying falsehood here is that the market will work for the consumer. This whole debacle proves that the market only cares about profits, and will literally let people die if it doesnt help their bottom line."
hahahah suck it Obama
Politifact is nonsense. 
Well isnt it just like PolitiiFact to pretend there was no government shut down and no Republican Ted Cruz calling to erase the government and start over.
"they really have to bend over backwards to make it look like both sides are as bad with the facts, dont they ? "
"The real problem here is that when presented with the facts, she declared that cant be true and her mind immediately shut down. Unfortunately, there are lots of people out there with this same mentality and trying to reason with them is a waste of time. AFP knows this too. More importantly, they also know that there are lots of people who will only see the ad on TV and will never see any news follow ups that prove it to be false. Does anyone here think that Fox is going to point out that her story is incorrect?"
"I couldnt get the link posted to work - if anyone else has a problem, link below"
I think that this blog is completely ignoring how the insurance companies are now using these huge drug costs to dump the sick people.

"Ive always wondered about these prices. I have a great health care plan in the Netherlands, high health, max dental, and a yearly own risk (same as co-pay?) capped at 500 euros. I pay 160/month. It covers all my meds, physio, consultations, and any therapy or surgery I might need. For those who pay over $1000/month, what are you getting... free blow jobs? "
"So here is the link to the lie of the year, 12.12.13 Politicfact http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/"
"The fact that this lady, who clearly wont be swayed by facts and numbers, is the best they could come up with is very telling. Youd think theyd be able to find a few real Obamacare horror stories, right?"
My favorite Nugent moment was [the response to his tweet](https://twitter.com/boring_as_heck/statuses/266201701919387648) about Obama being reelected.

What do the numbers next to them mean?
Thanks I was too tired last night to find that link. Ill add it to the OP though.
"Perfect! A simple voting guide that anyone can understand and commit to. For real, thanks OP!"
"Well, at least no one in my district voted for it. However, nearly half of my states House members and both of the senators (D and R) voted to renew it. Goddammit, North Carolina."
Mark Warner is not really a Democrat...been saying that for years. (VA)
"Do the world a favor and go to http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ , find your representative, and send them an email regarding your thoughts on the lawlessness of this surveillance. Just type in your zip code, and the name of your representative will come up along with a button that leads you straight to their email. "
"Wow, check out my home state of Texas. Kind of makes all that no gun registry talk a lot of bullshit when theyre all cool about snooping in your business. "
I see no evidence that a significant percentage of americans have come out against the Patriot Act. Politicians arent going to be more evolved on an issue than the general public. Convince your friends first. 
"Only 1 from Oregon, woo!"
Just as an update Im working on a response to this and the other FISA comments.
"Fuck yeah, Massachusetts! Only one person voted for it and it was our alcoholic!"
"My interpretation of the purpose of the article is to: 1. Call out all the legislators that voted for the renewal, and 2. Highlight the fact that most of them were Republicans. Of course, both liberals and conservatives will secretly read this as: *Finally, something we can leverage to get the other side to vote against their own party!* In other words, nothing will change. On a side note, thanks to Kieth Ellison, Tim Walz, Al Franken, and (my rep) Betty McCollum for voting against the bill!"
Thats the wrong list for the purposes of Snowden/NSA. [This is the right list.](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll569.xml) EDIT: And [this is the Senate vote.](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00236)
http://gauchnomica.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/patriot-act-vote-record/ List of every Congress member who voted to renew the Patriot Act 
"Fuck yeah, Hawaii!"
Im very thankful my rep isnt on this list.
Nobody from New Hampshite!
"Not only that, but it was one of the *only* things both sides agreed on... besides more defense spending."
"He is currently preparing a lawsuit against the NSA. Also, he voted against the Patriot Act in 2011. source: http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/senate/1/84"
Manning? Snowden? No. These are the real traitors.
Nice! Glad to see no one from Connecticut on there. 
"Massachusetts, with only one out of twelve, had the lowest proportion of their representatives voting for the Patriot Act. Oregon was next with just one of our seven. Ive been saying it for years, Oregon has great representation in Congress."
"Happy to live in Massachusetts where only 1 person voted for it. I dont live in her district, either. "
"Youre right I was being foolish. Thanks, I fixed it now. "
"I didnt see Vermont on the list, did you miss it?? Oh yeah, that is right"
Bill Nelson D-I practically grew up with him as my congressmen. And hes sooo bad. All they really do must be scheme to stay in there job...
Classic Israel... Steve Israel.
He is retiring for 2014. Doesnt mean he shouldnt be shamed out of office first though.
District while I used XX-0 to mean Senator so that it could be organizable by spreadsheet. 
Hawaii (not) in the hizouse! What what! 808 repreSENT!
"How much irony is there in the fact that for 50+ years we Americans were told that the Commies were out to destroy the American way of life, only to have it turn out that one of the only members of Congress to reliably oppose the creation of a massive KGB-style government program of spying on its own citizens would have been classified as a Commie in those days? Sinclair Lewis knew what the fuck he was talking about when he said, When fascism comes to America, it will come wrapped in an American flag."
"Please add all the senators who voted to renew FISA Amendments Act last year, until 2017. I believe there were 92 of them."
Please dont tell me Francis Underwood is on that list.
"Congress investigated and spent months on Roger Clemens, I wonder how much time and effort they will spend on investigating the NSA. According to this guy, NSA has been lying to congress about their activities."
"I want to relink this in my Facebook, but that typo in the very first word makes it looks stupid."
"Yup, and people laughed at Ron Paul when he warned people of the surveillance state. "
"So, what are the numbers after each name?"
"Its important to point out that the current Patriot Act is not the same as the Patriot Act as it was originally enacted. Before asking our legislature to resign en masse, do some research on it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_act#Reauthorizations"

hang em high please
I dont see Rand Paul on this list.
we really need to move on from this two party system... its destroying us.
Wow. 3 Democrats and 13 representatives total from California in the House. Out of 53. And yet *both* of our Democratic Senators voted for it? Idiots.
"God dammit, Texas. This is why we cant have nice things."
"As a resident of Oregon: Not sure if proud of other state reps, Or ashamed of mine (Walden, you tool). Edit: formatting"
Who says congress cant work together in a bipartisan fashion!
Fuck yea! Oregon only has one.
"As a Canadian, I have no idea what this list means. Honestly, I tried understanding it... can someone elaborate. (I do have prior knowledge of the patriot act)"
Notice how Montana isnt even listed. We know what the fuck were doing. ^Even ^though ^we ^only ^have ^three ^members ^of ^congress...
Tennessee Lamar Alexander R TN-0 Bob Corker R TN-0 Chuck Fleischmann R TN-3 Scott DesJarlais R TN-4 Diane Black R TN-6 Marsha Blackburn R TN-7 ah yes the Sinister Six of course they voted for it 
"But I completely understand why. If they vote to rescind this power, and an act of terrorism occurs, its political suicide. Its a black mark on their record theyll never be able to erase. Governments are governments. Its in their best interest to have as much power as possible. I dont like it, and you might not like it, but its the truth"
Print the list lets go hunting! Ps: if I dont post in 5min nsa got me
"Too bad they only list current members. Lets not forget [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_career_of_Hillary_Rodham_Clinton): &gt;[Senator Hillary] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she worked to address some of the civil liberties concerns with it,[28] before voting in favor of a compromise renewed act in March 2006 that gained large majority support.[29] "
"Barbara Mikulski why?!? You were my favorite old dyke, and now this. Im hoping her and Ben just did this out of some political necessity, since the senate is so crazy anyways. I can still hope."
"Well, at least Al Franken didnt vote for it."
FUCKING SAXBY CHAMBLISS.
Looks like around 95% of Repubs and 1/3 of Dems. The one time theres close to broad bipartisan agreement...... Can the SCOTUS void this? Its probably the best and only hope for civil liberties.
"Wait, what? Arizona didnt even make the list? Da hell?"
"You dont see Ron Paul in there, do you? All this Hope and Change sure is working out swell! Thanks for voting!"
Maybe I should send another thank you note to my representatives. They never seem to be on these shit lists. Seattle FTW!
Thats because they all got gerrymandered out. a 51/49 state and it has 4/12 for Reps. Not to mention Kasich is bounding for reelection. I wouldnt be too happy about Ohios politicians right now. Senator Brown and Rep. Ryan seem to be the exceptions.
I am so proud of Jared Polis! Im extremely biased but I think he is one of the best reps out there. He seriously cares about the needs and desires of his constituents and doesnt vote for bull shit like this.
"I remember watching the original Patriot Act getting signed into law and I said to myself this kind of methodology is a bad fucking idea and a horribly slippery slope. When it came up for renewal I knew it would pass, though I hoped it would not. I feel it does far more damage to our individual liberties than the guise of protection they say it promises."
What is troubling to me is that Feinstein is the Chair for the Intelligence Committee. Which means she is not only one of the most culpable in all this but has been one of the most ardent defenders of the NSAs conduct. 
Usually Alaska (AK) sneaks on most Arkansas (AR) lists. There are quite a few Arizona (AZ) reps on this one.
"Just to clarify, CT is only not on the list because Joe Lieberman is (thankfully) no longer a Senator. Thats still better than almost every other state though. "
Fuck you Niki Tsongas D MA-5!!!!! 
Booya no Vermont.
We should be able to impeach congress members.
Of course feinstein would vote that way. Cant stand her. Unfortunatly I dont think she will be leaving anytime soon. Great list by the way.
"by the looks of this list, the only thing republican and democrat lawmakers can seem to agree on is taking our rights."
"As an Arkansan, Im just stoked we picked up McCain."
"What. The. Fuck. This country is in serious decline and approaching a crossroads where the populace will make the choice of if this goes on or not. Almost regardless of how much bullshit some of the shit that various government agents are doing, if the population allows it, we will end up like Winston Smith in an INCSOC dystopia."
hey cool! mine didnt!

"Yes that may be true. However, it doesnt change the fact that they are suppose to be aware of what they are voting on and it was precisely their ineptness and demagogueing that got us into this mess. They should all be held accountable."
"So when republicans realized 76% of the vote came from them, and it was an entirely unpopular act, they did something that worked extraordinarily well: [ignore Obamas civil liberty revisions to the patriot act](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/179/revise-the-patriot-act-to-increase-oversight-on-go/), then blame him for it. Youll notice reddit is very anti-Obama when it comes to the patriot act, even though he tried to fix it "
"Does not make a difference if a Senator or Congress person is on this list, an complete overall haul is required. VOTE OUT all current sitting senators and congress people, those that will run who have pervious experience do not vote for them. "
"Did every single politician in office not swear under oath to protect and uphold the constitution? &gt; I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.

"Anyone who voted yes on the PA or NDAA should be actively opposed in their reelection bids. If your congressman is working against you, fire him/her."

Obama fails Benghazi victims time to impeach http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/9/benghazi-killers-still-on-the-lam-after-9-months-m/
Alex Jones was right! 
Am I the only one who thinks that the vote was done only to keep up the illusion that Congress has any power anymore? Let?s assume the reauthorization went down in flames instead of being continued by Congress. It should be obvious to anyone that the executive branch and the alphabet military/intelligence community would simply ignore the vote anyways. And since every legislator knows full well these groups knows all the dirty laundry of them and the people they care of. These politicans will not dare to even try to go against them anyways.
IBS HABBEDIG! http://i.imgur.com/d1L6VTi.jpg
"PATRIOT Act was only one part of legislation that allowed this to happen. If overturned, these kinds of programs would not be impacted."
It would have been more useful if they just gave us the names of those who did NOT vote for the Patriot Act. Were there any?
"Yay, my district didnt renew it :)"
How dare they have opinions.
DAMN YOU GREG WALDEEEEEEN
Fuck yeah Vermont.
"In Washington State Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray, and Reps. Rick Larsen of Everett and Jim McDermott of Seattle voted against."
"These men are traitors of the American people, and deserve to pay the iron price."
Booyah Vermont
Now we have The hitlist
America is such a dumb place.
Ron Johnson voted on behalf of WA and WI. ;)
"Thanks, fixed."
I will be writing the representatives from my state and strongly encourage others to voice their opinions.
Warner!
Fuck Ken Calvert. I mean Ive never liked him to begin with but still
Thats a lot of republicans and democrats voting to take away our freedom. Any bets that in the next election cycle we elect more republicans and democrats? And we will wonder why nothing changes.
It made me proud to see my representative wasnt on the list.
"Yeah I fixed that, it was a formatting issue. The word Arizona just wasnt in bold. "
"All of these democrat representatives/senators should face progressive primary competitors. This is the only way to a party that represents us. If you think primaries dont scare the living shit out of elected officials, look at the republicans. The threat of tea party primary competitors has moved the party to the right of Reagan."
"Ha, None of my represenatives or senators are on the list. Guess Im in the right zip code for this one."
I really wrote this list for the purposes of 1. I really dont care what happens to the Democratic party anymore and Im embarrassed to say how much I worked on the 2012 campaign. The only thing I really drew from the party breakdown is that Democrats are a pile of shit and Republicans are 3.2 piles of shit. Quantifying it at this point doesnt really matter.
"It did. It was a formatting issue so that Arizona wasnt in bold but everything was still on the list. Thanks though, I already fixed it."
"Just to clarify, I only included the vote in 2011 which extended several of the key provisions in Title II. "
67 Democrats and 214 Republicans to be precise. I would say 0 Independents but Bernie Sanders was the only Independent that was in both the 112th and 113th Congress.
Lot of r and and less d on that list. 
"&gt;I encourage all 281 legislators to resign in disgrace. This guys a little full of himself, isnt he?"
"Yup he probably is. However I was conveying a point with a little humor. Or as the French used to say, soyez r?alistes, demandez limpossible. Be realistic, demand the impossible!"
its strange how they agree on things that take away citizens rights and disagree on everything that creates stifling in government.
call your congressman to repeal the patriot act and sections 1021 and 1022 of the NDAA today !
"Wow, my congressman voted against CISPA and against the patriot act. That guy has my vote next election."
Dont you just love when both parties work on something together? 
"Joe Lieberman did, but (thankfully) he is no longer in Congress."
Who the fuck would sign that shit in Connecticut? Oh? No one? Fuck yes for my tiny ass state doing something right.
murder list
That was on purpose because it seemed pointless to be upset with a bunch of politicians that have retired. There are lists easily found that have the historic vote tallies. There is some news article that has every Patriot Act vote complied in one place. I cant find it at the moment though.
"The Nuremberg Trials were held between November 20th, 1945 and October 1st, 1946. The Washington trials will be held...when? We have the list already. -America"
The problem with this is everyone wants to blame their elected officials for the patriot act but public [opinion](http://www.pewresearch.org/2011/02/15/public-remains-divided-over-the-patriot-act/) has not always been so clearly against it. So many people so quick to forget how they had a part in deciding how much shit they were willing to put up with out of fear.
You missed Steve Cohen. Best representative ever. 
Steve Cohen(D:TN-9) voted Against it in 2011 so he isnt on the list. source: http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/1/376
"Great, now how do we get rid of them? Permanently."
Yes its very common. They want to verify youre actually apart of their district. Political offices love when someone out of district calls so they do not have to respond to them. source: Ive worked on both sides of calling offices as well as taking/responding to calls.
"Just called my representative, Scott Perry, and asked him to introduce legislation to repeal the patriot act. This was my first time calling and they asked for my full name and address. Is this common practice? Edit: senator toomeys voicemail box in both his harrisburg, pa office and DC office are both full! We are doing it, and I couldnt be more proud. "
"Hell yeah, go Connecticut."
Good guy Connecticut! 
"Haha, I fixed that btw. Arizona didnt get highlighted when I converted the list into document format."
"If you voted for George W. Bush, Barack Obama, or any of the politicians on this list, YOU are part of the problem. Down-voting me wont change that fact."
"The political system is a joke. They have issues where they disagree, but they can always agree on which way to fuck other who they represent. When they all work together, its not a democracy any more; its a dictatorship."
"damn, thats like all of them that need to go"
Its 53% of 535 legislators so on the bright side were nearly half way there! But yeah in all seriousness 281 members of Congress is a lot to get rid of.
what do the numbers to the right mean? /blush
The 0 stands for Senator and the numbers are district number. Because House districts change at least every ten years they are assigned a number. For example if you live on the East side of Idaho youre in District 2 but District 1 for the west. However most districts are a lot more complex and look like snakes: http://pjmedia.com/zombie/2010/11/11/the-top-ten-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts-in-the-united-states/
"this also brings up a very important point...the president, no mater what stance he has...doesnt have the ability to control a whole lot. "
"What the fuck...why did so many republicans vote to renew this. I feel so betrayed!! Fuck Republicans now, to think I would vote for david vitter as senator. "
"Dont let them do it again, KS!!!! Jerry Moran R KS-0 Lynn Jenkins R KS-2 Kevin Yoder R KS-3"
"Ron Paul warned us about this, but I laughed because he is white and wealthy so I didnt take him seriously. Anyways Hilary is going to bring us back to where we need! Hilary is going to save us!! Hilary 2016!!!"
"Good ol vermont not on the list. Mass only had one mention. New Hampshire... live free or die huh.. tis tis. Rhode Island you lil butt munch, fall in line with the rest of us. Overall, good job New England. "
Every single one of my state reps voted for it........wtf. 
I took the vote tally from the 2011 Act to renew various provisions in the Patriot Act. I then went through the list to remove every member of Congress that had retired and is no longer a member. The votes are from here: http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/senate/1/84 http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/1/376
"Where can I verify this roll? Opencongress.org has no mention of this vote. [EDIT] I am concluding that this is just someone posting the roll from an old vote on the Patriot Act, not one that occurred recently. People really need to start dating their information on the internet."
Proud to be from Vermont.
"Here I am thinking, I live in the very blue state of Massachusetts, our representatives couldnt be stupid enough to do that. Tsongas you motherfucker..."
"&gt; It comprises of 61 Senators and 220 Representatives coming from 45 states and includes 67 Democrats and 214 Republicans. Yes, there is a difference between the parties."
Go south dakota!
I am disgusted with my representative (Sensenbrenner). Was almost positive he wouldnt be on this list as he was entirely against SOPA and PIPA.
my state: fucking everybody
"It gives me a little chill to see on this list names like Barbara Boxer, Harry Reid and Dianne Feinstein. I expected every R on that list. But the irony of those particular Ds is like sweet nectar."
"Shit I was hoping to not find Massachusetts on the list. Youre usually so good Massachusetts, what the fuck!?"
1.01E+27
At least my home state of CT still has congressmen with some common sense...
It has Senators included. Obama isnt on the list because he wasnt in the senate in 2011. 
Excluding the Senate so Obama doesnt show up on this list?
"as with everything, Maine voted no. You go Susan!"
"Im glad my representative was one of the few to not vote to renew it. Im ashamed of our other 2, Orrin Hatch always was backwards, he also supported SOPA. Jim Mathesons an asshat."
"Just curious, isnt it the Democrats who want a larger government? If so, why is it that Republicans want to spy on all our business, thus creating a larger government. Im assuming Bush had a large role in convincing Republicans, but I am still curious. "
"Where is Rand Paul? Ron Paul? Regardless of what anyone thinks of these guys, at least they are not on that list. Not like all the other sell outs running the show."
Nope its a list of 281 of 535 of them. Noting some of them werent in office in 2011 so they couldnt vote on the bill.
Without looking: All of them?
Montana didnt even make the list. Niiiiiice
i heartily approve of this form of marking elected officials for their stance on legislation that negatively impacts their electorate. ***lets make this a thing.***
"I dont know if I should feel happy that I live in one of Michigans few districts that didnt vote to renew, or ashamed that most of Michigans did vote in favor."
"On the contrary, Senators are listed and labeled(I used the notion XX-0 to indicate Senate so it would be organizable in a spreadsheet). Also from the 2nd sentence, It comprises of 61 Senators."
The list is of HOUSE votes only.
"Once again, Vermont is the role model for the rest of the nation."
VOTE THEM OUT!
This list should prove to Reddit that its not about the R or the D. Its about both. Remove both from Congress.
Wouldnt it be easier to list the ones that voted against it?

"&gt; SFGate goes on to report that the Proctors annual household income is $64,000 - about two thousand dollars over the line at which income subsidies phase out. If the Proctors income was a mere $2000 less, theyd receive more than $14,000 of tax subsidies to purchase insurance. Because theyre just over the line, they face an enormous effective tax rate on that extra $2000 of income. This is absolute, complete, utter bullshit. The subsidies are progressive. Someone making just under the 400% of poverty threshold doesnt suddenly get their entire premium paid for. No, they get a small subsidy. The subsidies get larger and larger the closer you get to 133% of poverty threshold. [Chart](http://www.communitycatalyst.org/doc_store/publications/Affordability_in_ACA.pdf) See, propoganda like this is why we cant have nice things.

And a lot of the rate shock stuff is insurance companies raising prices as much as they can before the limit kicks in. Obamacare requires approval for annual premium increases over 10% so companies were trying to jack up rates before then. "
The real problem there is that so many states didnt expand Medicare to help the people who were above the poverty level but still pretty poor.
"(1) It takes time to react to that, for jobs to be created, for people to get hired. Not only that but other places dont necessarily completely replace Walmarts prices. If I got clothes and food at Walmart for $50, but Walmarts gone and now it the whole $50 for just the food at the grocery store, it doesnt look like Im going to a clothing store (especially if the clothing store is more expensive as well). Also, Walmart, knowing they pay crap and therefore cant get great employees, hires people that others may not be willing to. (2) Sure it seems unlike Walmart. It has worked at some large chains though (as an example, Whole Foods has a form of profit sharing they call Gainsharing). Its also fairly unlike most small stores Ive seen as well. I dont see your point with this."

YES REPORTERS GET VICIOUSLY ATTACKED BY THE RIGHT WINGER MACHINE, IF THEY DARE REPORT ON AGW.. when they hadnt before.. they really are quick to threaten your life.. dont think so? WTF DID GUNS HAVE TO DO WITH THE HEALTHCARE DEBATE.. that shit about watering the tree of liberty while holding a gun, was a THREAT.. if you support healthcare we will civil war. THEY DO THE SAME TO SCIENTISTS AND REPORTERS and it makes them BOTH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.) But like i said, according to polling their appears to be hope for the GOP.. maybe in 20-30 years when these folks start taking office, the right wont be so radically right. They really are one of the most right wing groups in this planets history."
"Yet another concrete example of the failure of leadership in this country, and the poisonous influence of religion. A little lesson in reality for Jimmy Inhofe, humans put a hole in the ozone layer and we could have destroyed it completely if we wanted to. If we had done that, all life that the sun touches would die. We can cause a nuclear winter. And we are causing global warming. So for him to say humans lack the ability to affect the climate because control is limited to divine powers. shows that he is irrational, and dangerously out of touch with reality. He is many decades behind where the rest of us are here in the real world. He is the national equivalent of one of these religious nutjob preachers that tell their congregations not to vaccinate their children. He rejects reality, rationalism, and common sense because of his religion. He and other politicians like him are drunk drivers behind the wheel of a car."
Occams Razor isnt used by the Republican Party.
Duh. How else can they afford all those fancy bow ties
They invented that criticism *precisely because* they themselves are bought and paid for. Thats a basic propaganda technique ? accuse the other side of what you yourself are doing ? and the fucked up thing is that it works.
Liars think everyone lies. Cheaters think everyone cheats. Bought-and-paid-for politicians think everyone is bought and paid for.
"They *say* that, but do you really think they *believe* it? Stuff like that is just red meat for low-information voters. "
"The same phenomenon happens in other professions. Thieves are worried about being stolen from, fraudsters nervously check their bank balance, burglars have good locks, etc. If you have always been bought and paid for, like Inhofe, you would assume everyone else is on the take."
Its like cheating spouses. They assume their SO is cheating because they are. 
"Ive heard people say this, but never gotten an answer when I ask whos doing the buying. The DNC? Elon Musk? Has anyone ever heard who these conspirators are supposed to be and why--if theres nothing wrong with the climate--they would want to convince people there is?"
"Go with what you know. If we are paid for, than THEY MUST BE DOING IT TOO"
The irony is that most politicians are bought and paid for. 
"Perhaps some Republican citizens believe that, but I seriously doubt Republican politicians do. They know where the money comes from and who it receives it."
They also believe that every media source in the world other than Fox News is bought and paid for and is part of a global liberal conspiracy.
Yever have a girlfriend who always said you were cheating but then it turned out she was cheating? People suspect others of what they themselves are capable of.
"Dodgy, LOTS of dodgy shit goes down in getting grants and in academia generally. But generally, you risk being made an ass of at any 4 srs conference, so the science needs to stay clean. "
I bought my scientist at the corner market.
"its projection. hes paid not to think, but to speak and vote a certain way, so positions that others take are, in his and many conservatives view, just as shallow. opposing views must have a corresponding benefactor (to pay all the scientists), therefore conspiracy."
"A lot of the ones in Oklahoma are though, thats what you dont get. Theyre the ones telling us that all the earthquakes are in no way related to fracking, and that radioactive tapwater that catches on fire is normal. Oil and gas companies pay better than academic institutions."
"I think you should replace Republicans with idiots, kind of unfair to pigeonhole them all into the head up the ass category."
"Do republicans actually believe this, or do they just convince the plebs that they believe all scientist are bought by big money."
Were not all bad. Im^just^a^quiet^republican
Not the ones in office. Theyre just saying whatever theyre being paid to say because they know enough of the masses will believe it.
Republican conservative thinking appears to me to use projection frequently to understand other peoples motivations. It explains a lot in my experience. 
"The same argument could apply since they do receive funding from outside sources and its not exactly unheard of for companies to commission studies from researchers and scientists that end up being favorable to the companys objectives. The problem is that you dont know if thats his position because it has been purchased by these organizations or if they already knew his position and decided to fund him because of that, which is the exact same question we could ask of any scientist who published work that was favorable to a company who commissioned it."
"Why not? They figure *they* are all on the take, how could scientists not be? I mean, that would be stupid!"
"Maybe its just all politicians know, so they assume everything else works the same way."
"Pathological projection, Im bought, therefore other people have the same motives."
"If you are a whore, you believe everyone you meet is a whore. Everyone who works around you is a whore and that you are merely the purest example of whoredom."
Republicans dont believe that. They say that so that they can go on fucking the environment for money. Nobody actually believes it. 
"Funny you say this. My dad is a pretty strict Democrat against all the rich/corporations, but hes also religious and thinks scientists are all liars out for profit."
What else do you think they be doin rockin those titration devices and Erlenmeyer flasks and whatnot!?!?!?
"Like many Republican outcries, this is textbook projection. Try to accuse your opponent of all the wrongs you do, because hey, if you do it then surely they do, too."
"The difference is scientists get paid not for their findings, but for services rendered. Politicians are paid to not utilize scientific findings. "
Anything the Republicans accuse other groups of is something they themselves do.
They are assuming all people are like them.
This sounds like senator Mckenzie on Stargate SG-1.
Obviously not the 3% that speaks the truth. 
God damn big eviroment. Everybody is in thier pocket. 
"Yes, ALL Republicans believe this. /s"
"You would be surprised...the academic community is a lot more circlejerky than a lot of people think. Whether is it applying for research grants, finding a research job, or getting your worked published...it is a very political process."
"and republicans rape the white women, kill the gays and put all the brown skins in to slavery"
"Before everyone gets in an uproar remember that the supreme court isnt about justice necessarily. It is about constitutionality. If you want this changed write your congressman, organize protests, act to change it through the legislature since the courts hands are tied. "

"Good idea. I will get right on that as soon as Im done with my 60 hour work week, taking my kids to their after school sports, paying taxes, and yard work."
"The wealthy will always have disproportionate influence. So long as you allow free speech, the wealthy will always be able to promote their viewpoint. This is the entire reason media corporations exist. How can you reasonably have media companies capable of spending unlimited funds to promote a viewpoint via advertising or journalism (yellow or otherwise) and then not allow other forms of corporations not to espouse a viewpoint? The problem is, and always has been, the lack of expedient reporting. If corporations can (and have always been) able to espouse a viewpoint via journalism, this problem is not a new one; we only care now because instead of biased reporting, companies can now outwardly support candidates. So, in the case of reporting, promote monthly reports detailing donors (preventing anonymity, of course) and youve improved the system to better than it was pre-Citizens United. And guess what: This is in the Citizens ruling, where the Justices said it was Constitutional with appropriate oversight and reporting. Edit: thats why media corporations *exist*"
"@ Senator Sanders That is a very significant confirmation. Thank you, sir."
&gt;Now [the wealthy] will be the *only* influence on American politics. Not entirely true! We can still donate the $5 or $20 or $50 we can afford. ;) EDIT: A few of them actually understand that they would be better off if *we* were better off. Maybe the rest will learn that eventually. (I wont be holding my breath.)
"You mean like how 95% of the economic recovery has gone to the richest 1%, and we have a political party that steadfastly refuses to raise taxes on the only people making any new money?"
"Hey, you say that like it is a bad thing. [I for one welcome our ~~new~~ corporate overlords.](http://images.sodahead.com/polls/003846893/54481183_costco_2_xlarge.jpeg) "
&gt;What more proof is needed to show that our government is controlled by ~~corporations~~ capital The true culprit.
"Already, virtually no piece of legislation can get passed unless it has the okay from corporate America."
"Well a brief review of human history would indicate you are correct and that, no, they dont seem to understand that. Stock up on pitch forks."
If the game is rigged so much in favor of the wealthy the poor have only one remedy left to get justice: violence. I wonder if the rich understand that they make violent revolution a necessity. 
They will create a system? They have already created this system. Wages have been stagnant for the middle class in the last 30 years. Meanwhile the wealth of the rich has done nothing but skyrocket. Gonna be interesting to see how much more this country will take
Kind of amazing how Idiocracy is happening in the infant stage right now and most of us have our heads in the sand. 
Wait. Thats not what the highly-concentrated media owned by the very richest tells me. Now I dont know what to believe.
"This is the problem with improperly regulated capitalism. Money is the most important thing, those with the most money can redefine the rules so they get more money, and because of all their money, their voice is greater than ours. "
&gt; Welcome to Costco bitches. I love you. I like money.
"The wealthy already had a disproportionate influence on American politics. Now they will be the *only* influence on American politics. What more proof is needed to show that our government is controlled by corporations (owned by wealthy people)? I dont have a problem with wealth, but I do have a problem with wealthy people using their wealth to get more wealth *at my expense*. Do you think the wealthy are going to create a level playing field for everyone so that there is the potential for upward mobility? No. They will create a system that completely favors them at everyone elses expense. Corporate totalitarianism marches on. Welcome to Costco bitches. I love you."
Well it will be even worser!
&gt;They will create a system that completely favors them at everyone elses expense. They already have one.
If money doesnt influence politics then why does *anyone* contribute money?
"The idea that wealthy people are the only influence on American politics is absolutely absurd. Elections are won with votes, not dollars. The wealthy can spend as much as they want on campaigns, but ultimately nobody wins without the consent of the voters. What is your objection, exactly? Is it that the recipients of these funds will be able to sell the voters on their promises better than the other guy? Because thats what democracy is all about, at the end of the day. "
"I think the figure is more like 0.1%, but yes. I just have a hard time thinking people that make 350,000/year are evil empire rule the world kind of people. They are probably busting their ass running a business and just trying to raise a family."
&gt; What more proof is needed to show that our government is controlled by corporations (owned by wealthy people)? Why do you think the founders wanted a limited government to begin with? 
"&gt; Do you think the wealthy are going to create a level playing field for everyone so that there is the potential for upward mobility? No. Out of sheer curiosity, how familiar are you with income *mobility* data? Because I think you might be surprised. "

Despite my libertarian personal ideology (that should never be tried to be implemented on other people) I have to agree with you. Its just inevitable for money to concentrate into fewer hands as time goes on.
You act as though citizens cant simply pull another lever when they go to vote.
"&gt;I dont have a problem with wealth, but I do have a problem with wealthy people using their wealth to get more wealth at my expense. in my opinion,it isnt about wealth anymore. its about power. at this point people / corporations with that kind of money, while still wanting to keep their wealth and get more, are more interested in what kind of power they can wield with their enormous wealth. its simply the golden rule: he who has the gold makes the rules."
Great points.
"When a billionaires voice is so much louder than everyone elses and elected officials cannot hear the voices of anyone besides the billionaires then, in effect, speech does not exist for anyone but the billionaire. And that is how they want it."
&gt;Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech The First Amendment doesnt allow for laws that influence the type or influence of speech. Just because a billionaires speech holds more influence doesnt mean this country is being destroyed.
Ironically Costco has like the employee satisfaction ratings ever.
"It was a reference to the movie Idiocracy If you havent seen it, you would not understand it."
"I dont have a problem with wealth, but I do have a problem with wealthy people using their wealth to get more wealth at my expense. Thats the truth "
"&gt; I dont have a problem with wealth, but I do have a problem with wealthy people using their wealth to get more wealth at my expense. You kinda assume this without proving it"
"&gt; I dont have a problem with wealth, but I do have a problem with wealthy people using their wealth to get more wealth at my expense. what exactly do you think wealth is? "
[Wealth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth)
sadly The Constitution does not require a level playing field. 
"&gt;Welcome to Costco bitches. I love you. I know the reference, but I just wanted to point out that Costco is [fucking](http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/06/news/economy/costco-fast-food-strikes/) [amazing](http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/costcoceo.asp) about worker pay when compared to any other corporation. They really are one of the few businesses that understand that squeezing your work force for as much profit as you can isnt healthy, ethical, or intelligent."
Costco pays pretty well from what I understand. This is welcome to wal-mart.
As is said a lot in the cryptocoin trading world - Someone is always left holding the bag.

"Respectfully I disagree with this notion that only the wealthy will have an influence on politics. Yes, while we have seen wealthy aristocrats play a role in American politics since the inception of the United States government, this has by no means prevented the the middle or lower classes from contributing to the system. While a single wealthy individual can contribute millions to a candidates campaign, this has not stopped those with less money from pooling there resources together and attempting to get the bully pulpit to swing in their favor. So to at the moment limit the ability of a person to donate money as an act of freedom of speech when there exists no specific stipulation in the Constitution? That truly is an unjust act. For youre in a way stating that someones voice should count less all because you disagree with how they choose to spend their money. Its their prerogative to burn through it for all they care. That said, what can be done in this situation? For one, we respect the opinion delivered by the justices in this case, no matter who they were appointed by. Even if some areas of the law may seem morally grey, they are doing their best to make the standards of the constitution are met. Perhaps instead question how they may have approached that opinion, and above all dont simply label these five justices as conservative and unyielding regardless of the situation. I could easily do the same and claim the other four members of the court are only there to deliver liberal agenda decisions, but thats not what I believe at all. Theyre all there to deliver a decision and they all approach it differently through their interpretation of the Constitution. Remembering that, focus your efforts towards changing and influencing the legislation and amendments Congress creates. Have an interest? Great, now find a group of people with that similar interest, form a coherent group, protest/lobby, pool your money and/or raise money, and put it towards making the government do what you want. It may take work, but let it never be said that the American people dont have an equal share at pushing their government to pursue a certain course of action."
"Democrats funded by billionaires complain about Republicans funded by billionaires The left?s fixation with the Koch brothers is akin to CNN?s obsession with the Malaysian Airlines disappearance. It?s 24/7 speculation and conspiracy theories mixed with endless repetition. It?s hard to describe the nonstop onslaught from the Democrats? PACs and campaigns against the billionaire libertarian brothers. Democrats run ads, complain about them in mailers and jabber about them on cable TV shows. The brothers seem, in some cases, their prime issue. So far its been a frightfully expensive lark, not doing much to up the ante against Republicans. But the Democrats seem to think its the only way to boost their base. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid goes on tirades like this: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nev., faces reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 11, 2014 (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) The Koch brothers and other moneyed interests are influencing the politics in a way not seen for generations. Republican senators have come to the floor to defend the Koch brothers? attempt to buy our democracy. Once again, Republicans are all in to protect their billionaire friends. Not only have Senate Republicans come to the floor to defend the Koch brothers personally, they have again and again defended the Koch brothers? radical agenda ? and it is radical, at least from the middle-class perspective. We get it ? billionaires are bad, bad guys. Now, it wouldnt be so despicable ? anyone in politics these days can come up with a distracting, unsuccessful bogeyman ? if it were not for the sheer hypocrisy of it all. The Senate Majority PAC ads have gone up in Louisiana and Colorado harping on ?out-of-state billionaires? trying to ?rig the system.? It?s very similar to Reids assault on the Koch brothers from the Senate floor. According to reports, the Senate Majority PAC has only just begun. News reports tell us that the Senate Majority PAC is going up with a $3 million TV ad attack against Republicans in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan and North Carolina based on this message. But when you look at Senate Majority PAC and those taking their money, it is hard to miss ? you guessed it ? the out-of-state billionaires trying to rig the system. Who is the biggest donor to the Senate Majority PAC? Out-of-state billionaire Michael Bloomberg, according to the latest FEC filings. But he is not alone. There are a whole gaggle of billionaires giving to the Senate Majority PAC who hail from states which dont have Senate races in 2014. The list of billionaire donors to the outfit condemning out-of-state billionaire donors includes billionaires Eli Broad, Jon Stryker, Steven Spielberg and Dirk Ziff. Also ponying up money to the Senate majority fund are not-quite-billionaire Hollywood donors such as Jeffrey Katzenberg and the Weinstein Company. (All you have to do is compare the contributor list on OpenSecrets.org to the Forbes billionaire list.) The candidates the Senate Majority PAC is supporting also take money directly from out-of-state billionaires. Using the donor look-up search on OpenSecrets you can find, for example, Sen. Mary Landrieu ? whose campaign has been blasting the Koch brothers ? got money from a different out-of-state billionaire, Eli Broad. What about North Carolina Senator Kay Hagan? Her campaign gripes about the billionaire Koch brothers but she took billionaire money directly from television mogul Haim Saban. Not to be left out, Sen. Mark Pryor, who also decries billionaires flooding the state, eagerly rakes in cash from Colorado moneyman Charles Ergen. Sen. Mark Udall is upset about all that billionaire money but has his own billionaire donors ? Soros and Leonard Lauder, for example ? in addition to the benefit of the Senate Majority PAC?s billionaire-financed ads decrying the role of billionaires in politics. Billionaires also route money to these Democrats through the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Now, Ive got no problem with third-party money or with billionaires giving money directly to campaigns; neither do most Republicans. But it is Democrats who brought up the Koch complaint and who have been impugning the Koch brothers. In 2010 Democrats attacked the nefarious and non-existent ?foreign money? from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; now it?s two businessmen. But if it?s all that terrible to take billionaires? money then the Democratic candidates and the Senate Majority PAC should give back their billionaires? cash. If not, the next time the aggrieved Democrats are on a cable TV new show, someone should ask them: Why are your billionaires any better than your opponents billionaires?"
"It occurs to me that the reason money buys so much in politics is because it purchases propaganda in elections. Without this linchpin, moneys electoral value plummets, and the influence of money upon politics becomes drastically lessened. Would a comprehensive, widespread, non-partisan program of anti-propaganda education be of substantial benefit to the quality of democracy?"
Read snow crash I think you might like it.
You misspelled Walmart. 
"I had a very lengthy debate with a redditor who argued for the increased freedom of speech for corporations. His argument: You can only provide MORE speech, you cannot regulate equality of speech. That is, its okay that corporations get more speech and everyone else as a result receive less time with their voices. But to raise the voices of everyone else and equalize?Whoa buddy... Excuse me for trying to argue for a functioning democratic republic. The way I see it, youve allotted one person in a sea of persons to have a megaphone while everyone else is trying to yell out what they want to say. Certainly your representative cant hear you among the crowd, nonetheless the megaphone. And so while everyone has the ability to lobby for their interests, some have a megaphone while most unfortunately do not. This is a plague on our system."
"Unbelievable, people still think thats the fault of rich people. Sorry buddy, other way around, its called a single point of failure. I mean, no disrepect, I was an idiot too once."
"&gt; What more proof is needed to show that our government is controlled by corporations (owned by wealthy people)? Or labor unions? https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php Government has power, which attracts money from many sources. Power is the problem, not money, it is only a symptom."
"This is whats called a plutocracy. Ironically, Noam Chomsky talks about this on Democracy Now."
"This is why a proportional plurality vote is a bad idea unless everyone is required to vote, like in Australia."
"Ok, so first of all, your (and OPs) comments are completely out of line with reality. No one is buying elections. Money isnt anything like the only way to have a voice in politics. In fact, money isnt even that effective as a tool in elections: ...we can find no statistically observable relationship between the outside spending and the likelihood of victory. ([How Much did Money Really Matter in 2012?, Lee Drutman, Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/11/09/how-much-did-money-matter/)) If we look at the margin of victory for all incumbents who ran in 2012 with major party opposition, and compare it to the amount by which they outspent their opponent (or were outspent by their opponent), the relationship is statistically insignificant. ([Is the Value of Campaign Spending Overstated? Sean Trende, Real Clear Politics](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/11/14/is_the_value_of_campaign_spending_overstated_120667.html)) When a candidate doubled their spending, holding everything else constant, they only got an extra one percent of the popular vote. It?s the same if you cut your spending in half, you only lose one percent of the popular vote. So we?re talking about really large swings in campaign spending with almost trivial changes in the vote. ([Steve Levitt, as quoted in Does Money Really Buy Elections? Stephen Dubner, Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/12/does-money-really-buy-elections-a-new-marketplace-podcast/)) Just as importantly, youre choosing to completely ignore the legitimate concerns and opinions of the (on the whole, rather smart, educated, and thoughtful) justices who made that ruling. Consider that it is completely legal for me to buy an ad that says save the whales and run it as long as I like. Any law that prevented me from doing this is (I think) a pretty clear violation of my right to free speech. I care about saving whales, and I am spending my own money to tell people how I feel about it, and thats just fine. Well how about an ad that says: Save the whales! John Smith would save the whales - vote for John smith! Also my opinion. Also my money. Stopping me from spending my money to support something (or someone) I believe in seems to me a violation of free speech. Maybe it doesnt to you. Maybe you think ya, well kinda, but not really because... Fine. But dont pretend that people who think ya well maybe not, but also maybe yes... are out of their minds and from another planet."

But they are saving face...
"When its a Democrat, its mildly, and unintentionally, misleading. When its a Republican, its an out-and-out lie fabricated wholecloth meant to slander and incite. Seems a bit different in scale."
"Look, Politifacts [Lie of 2011](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/20/lie-year-democrats-claims-republicans-voted-end-me/) wasnt exactly a [strong example](http://swampland.time.com/2011/12/20/politifacts-semantic-distinction-of-the-year-ending-medicare/) of the credibility that theyve worked so hard to convince people of. It wasnt as if this year didnt have a plethora of things that Obama and certain Democrats *actually* misled us on, so it is pretty hard for me to view this as anything other than another hatchet job designed to prove their balance. "
"No, lets stick to the subject here. Were talking about Obama misleading the public. Lets not pretend that a site that is rocketed to the top every time it calls out GOP bullshit (which it should do) is all of a sudden wrong, or doing it to save face when it goes after Obama. "
"He didnt mislead anyone. When he made that comment, it was 100% truthful. The ACA allows grandfathered policies to continue. So, if I lose my insurance I had when he made the comment, it was 100% the decision of my insurance company. They can blame the ACA all they want, but no part of the law called for people to be dropped. How someone can then claim Obama lied is baffling to me. "
The whole point of me posting the video was to try to understand why she said what she did. Im not looking for a gotchya moment - Im asking people to explain what I found to be confusing. 
"She has shown commendable patience there. Id tell him to read the bill, and if its above his mental capacity level, he should rethink his career choice."
"Ok...but in the previous transcript (unless it was incorrect) it sounds like she is admitting that the bill cuts five hundred billion from Medicare. What confuses me is the exchange towards the end of the video: **Rep. Shimkus:** What are the five hundred billion dollars in cuts for, preserving Medicare or funding healthcare [ACA] law? **Secretary Sebelius:** Sir, the Affordable Care Act ads twelve years to the Medicare trust fund according to every actuary and the five hundred billion dollars represents a slow down in the growth rate of Medicare over the next ten years from what was projected at 8%...[unintelligible] **Rep. Shimkus:** So wait is it Medicare, is it using it to save Medicare or are you using it to fund healthcare reform? Which one? **Secretary Sebelius:** Both. **Rep. Shimkus:** So youre double counting. He asks her whether the cuts preserve medicare of fund the ACA. She responds, not directly answering the question, at which point he asks her once again it its to save Medicare or are you using it to fund healthcare reform? This question is further clarifying his original question of What are the five hundred billion dollars in cuts for to which she responds, yes She says that there arent cuts but it also sounds like she is admitting there are. I guess that is where my confusion lies. "
"You could read a few articles on the matter opposed to trying to find a gotcha moment from Sebelius. http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/may/15/us-chamber-commerce/chamber-says-bill-nelson-voted-cut-medicare-500-bi/ The $500 billion comes from the amount the ACA hopes to save and cut from slowing down the growth rate of Medicare expenditures in the future. They arent cutting $500 billion from the current levels, and in fact, those levels will still rise. ACA just says, not by as much now, and is not meant to cut any Medicare benefits. And Im not sure what problem you have with the answer both. They are trying to slow the growth rate of Medicare expenditures. That can very well be argued to be both good for Medicares longevity, and to help offset some of the costs associated with the rest of the ACA. It doesnt have to be one or the other."
"Unfortunately, Obama has done a good job of proving the crazies right. I openly mocked the NRA (as did [others](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKkD2VX-Jc)) for their characterization of Obama as a snake in the grass who was biding his time and secretly planning working [under the radar](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/14/national-rifle-association/barack-obama-coming-after-guns-under-radar-nra-say/) with Sarah Brady to work on gun control which would be rolled out in a second term. Seriously. Obama was solid as a rock, not pushing for a single restriction to civil liberties even after Aurora. Who could seriously believe Obama was simply biding his time after that? Well . . . they were right. The first major act of gun violence after the election and Obama and Biden launch an enormous push for gun control -- the most coordinated gun control push ever, with all major gun control advocacy groups playing an unusual supporting role for the Executive as he pushes gun control on a unified front. I hate it when the crazy and paranoid are right. I seriously do. It breeds paranoia and encourages people to separate their judgement from observable evidence. What sane person would estimate Obamas second term actions on gun control based on anything other than his track record of NO push for gun control in his first term? Well . . . we sane people were wrong."

"&gt; But for the last 80 years the conservatives have thwarted every attempt at universal coverage. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving us... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 40 million (mostly poor) Americans who were completely uninsured &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 million people had to claim medical bankruptcy every year &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 45,000 deaths every year from a lack of decent health insurance There have been zero attempts at universal coverage in the last 80 years so they couldnt have thwarted it. It was the left that gave us the HMOs, an original attempt to control costs and cover more people and it got to the point where you have your list. And even with the ACA in full effect millions of people will still not be insured, more people will still die from a lack of coverage (though factually no one has ever died from lack of coverage but for a lack of care). And even more factually correct on who held up the ACA was the two Dem Senators who had to be bribed with special medicare coverage for their respective states just for it to pass cloture in the Senate. Stop acting like your side of the aisle is the only one looking out for the middle class when in the next couple of months another 7-10 million people will be losing their health insurance because of the ACA and the HHS changing the regulation language. So how does that stack up to your view of what compassion is?"

You are correct, I should have said the last 110 years. **[A Brief History: Universal Health Care Efforts in the US](http://www.pnhp.org/facts/a-brief-history-universal-health-care-efforts-in-the-us)** &amp;nbsp; In 1906, the American Association of Labor Legislation (AALL) led the campaign for health insurance. In 1912, they created a committee on social welfare which held its first national conference in 1913. Despite its broad mandate, the committee decided to concentrate on health insurance, drafting a model bill in 1915. In 1917, the US entered WWI and anti-German fever rose. The government-commissioned articles **denouncing ?German socialist insurance?** and opponents of health insurance assailed it as a **?Prussian menace?** inconsistent with American values. In the Red Scare, immediately after the war, when the government attempted to root out the last vestiges of radicalism, opponents of compulsory health insurance associated it with Bolshevism and buried it in an avalanche of anti-Communist rhetoric. This marked the end of the compulsory national health debate until the 1930?s. FDR ? Wagner Bill, National Health Act of 1939 But there was one more push for national health insurance during FDR?s administration: The Wagner National Health Act of 1939. Though it never received FDR?s full support, the proposal grew out of his Tactical Committee on Medical Care, established in 1937. The essential elements of the technical committee?s reports were incorporated into Senator Wagner?s bill, the National Health Act of 1939, which gave general support for a national health program to be funded by federal grants to states and administered by states and localities.** However, the 1938 election brought a conservative resurgence and any further innovations in social policy were extremely difficult.** Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bills: 1943 and onward through the decade The Wagner Bill evolved and shifted from a proposal for federal grants-in- aid to a proposal for national health insurance. First introduced in 1943, it became the very famous Wagner-Murray- Dingell Bill. The bill called for compulsory national health insurance and a payroll tax. **Opposition to this bill was enormous and the antagonists launched a scathing red baiting attack on the committee** saying that one of its key policy analysts, I.S. Falk, was a conduit between the International Labor Organization (ILO) in Switzerland and the United States government. After FDR died, Truman became president (1945-1953), and his tenure is characterized by the Cold War and Communism. The health care issue finally moved into the center arena of national politics and received the unreserved support of an American president. Though he served during some of the most virulent anti-Communist attacks and the early years of the Cold War, Truman fully supported national health insurance. But the opposition had acquired new strength. **Compulsory health insurance became entangled in the Cold War and its opponents were able to make ?socialized medicine? a symbolic issue in the growing crusade against Communist influence in America.** Congress had mixed reactions to Truman?s proposal. The chairman of the House Committee was an anti-union conservative and refused to hold hearings. **Senior Republican Senator Taft declared, ?I consider it socialism. It is to my mind the most socialistic measure this Congress has ever had before it.? Taft suggested that compulsory health insurance, like the Full Unemployment Act, came right out of the Soviet constitution and walked out of the hearings.** **In 1946, the Republicans took control of Congress and had no interest in enacting national health insurance**. They charged that it was part of a large socialist scheme. Truman responded by focusing even more attention on a national health bill in the 1948 election. After Truman?s surprise victory in 1948, the AMA thought Armageddon had come. They assessed their members an extra $25 each to resist national health insurance, and in 1945 they spent $1.5 million on lobbying efforts which at the time was the most expensive lobbying effort in American history. They had one pamphlet that said, **?Would socialized medicine lead to socialization of other phases of life? Lenin thought so. He declared socialized medicine is the keystone to the arch of the socialist state.?** &amp;nbsp; This only takes us up to conservatives actions up to 1949, more to go but Im weary of this, and you, since you are wrong on almost everything you said here."

How much would they cost tax payers if they had no job?
This implies that if they didnt work at Wal-Mart they would be able to work somewhere else. Maybe the reality is that if they didnt work at Wal-Mart they wouldnt work anywhere and taxpayers would have to spend even more to take care of them.
I worked at walmart about 10 years ago. Im white and they started me out at 7.50 an hour. Horrible I know but I was desperate for a job at the time. Found out a black dude that had been there for like 3 years and was stocking the ever hated can good isle was making 6 bucks an hour lol. I told him what they started me out at and he clocked out on the spot and went home. Next day he had a raise and I got in trouble for talking about wages to other workers. But I felt like he needed to see just how shitty he was being treated. I quit shortly after that bc lets face it...... Walmart sucks. Edit - I was the only white guy in the overnight stocker position. Rest were black. And I started making more $ an hour than everyone else. And I didnt even ask for 7.50/hr. they choose to start me at that. Was a bit of an eye opener for me. I remember the guy that clocked out was bragging about making the big bucks and I laughed and told them all what I was making. I couldnt believe they were being fucked over so badly. Felt a little dirty too knowing that I was paid more just for being white. I was also the youngest guy on the crew by several years. Smh. 
How much do unemployed people cost taxpayers?
"If the minimum wage had risen with inflation, it would be approximately $12.20 or so per hour. If it had risen with inflation and cost of living, it would be nearly $20.00. Lets focus on that, not Walmart in particular. Businesses focus on the bottom line, and will pay employees what they have to or what they can. Every business. All those mom and pop stores around the country? They pay minimum wage too. Gas stations, convenience stores, dollar stores, furniture stores (plus commission in this case probably). Dont focus on the company or the store, focus on the minimum wage."
"Too many fucking people in this thread defending a huge corporation that HOARDS massive profits that never see the light of day in the U.S. economy. How you people can even think about justifying Walmarts low wages sickens me. Yes they return some taxes to the local economy, BUT THEY COULD STILL DO THAT AND PROVIDE A LIVABLE WAGE."
"This subreddit is trash, all that gets posted here is the same circlejerk content with inflammatory titles. Im unsubscribing now"
"The person that wrote this is fucking retarded and should never try to write about finance/economics again. Comparing capital gains on stock ownership to ordinary income? Saying that Walmarts COST money to taxpayers, when the workers would likely be taking more subsidies if they were unemployed? Everyone that thinks that Walmart is the problem is a fucking idiot. "
"So, why arent Republicans attacking this government welfare beneficiary? Oh, thats right...because its a **corporate** welfare check."
So were paying half the labor costs for Walmart to shovel us goods made outside the US. 
But I saved a nickel on my box of twinkies.
"The central question revolves around whether or not multi-national corporations should have a moral obligation to their workers to treat them as actual human beings that need to feed families or can they just treat them as costs that should be cut to the bone in order to improve profit margins which in turn gets their stock price higher. If you side with the costs argument, then how do you justify the humongous pay gap between upper management and lower wage earners of the company. Certainly the corporation should hold every cost to the same standard. Unfortunately this is not the case. Using a measure of CEO compensation that includes the value of stock options granted to an executive, the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was 18.3-to-1 in 1965, peaked at 411.3-to-1 in 2000, and sits at 209.4-to-1 in 2011.-Economic Policy Institute report http://www.epi.org/publication/ib331-ceo-pay-top-1-percent/ "
"Why the fuck has Wal-Mart become the rallying cry? Wouldnt EVERY employer of minimum wage workers be guilty of these same things? Wheres the Starbucks outrage? McDonalds? Lowes? Etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc. Im against anything that singles out specific companies/people. Theres never going to be a Make wal-mart pay more Act. "
Conservatives love to rail against the welfare state. The same welfare state that subsidizes the labor costs of all those corporate interests that conservatives love so dearly.
"No, it said a typical Wal-Mart *could* cost $1.7 million per store per year *if all the employees availed themselves of all the government assistance programs for which they qualify.* The study had no way to determine how many employees were availing themselves so they had no way to know how much it actually does cost."
So Walmart costs US tax payers about $8 billion a year. Nice...
"Ah capitalism. Isnt it just wonderful that we get to tell people get a fucking job, and then refuse to pay them a living wage, and then chastise them for not having a better job, and then complain that our tax dollars go to supporting their employer? Its almost as if Wal-Mart employees arent actually people too and we shouldnt care if they get paid shit because hey we get to spend very little at Wal-Marts. We obviously want them open and to get that end, we need to have people working them. But those people must not deserve a living wage and they are pieces of shit for relying on government subsidies. Its clearly their fault. Its so easy to just walk in and grab a CEO spot anywhere. What lazy bums. **Seriously, raise minimum wage up to a living wage.**"
"A serious chicken-or-the-egg fallacy. The same could be said of ANY minimum wage job. The reason theyre on the government dole is because they dont make enough money. The reason they dont make enough money is because they dont have any particularly valuable skills or education, and as a result, they get a job at walmart to help out somehow. "
"This type of analysis is trash. Lets look at whos really benefiting here. The top 50% of people in this country pay virtually all of the income taxes. 97% to be precise. So when we say taxpayers, were talking about people who make over $38k a year and over. Not exactly stellar, but not exactly poverty either. So now we know who this subsidization is costing, but lets look at who its benefiting and how much exactly. According to [this study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w11809) Wal-Marts low prices made consumers better off by 25% of food consumption. The poorest quintile in America spends about 26% of their income on food. In other words if youre in the bottom quintile, shopping at Wal-Mart will boost your income by 6.5%. So lets add all this up. There are 24,217 households in the bottom quintile and they make anywhere between 0 and $20,259 a year. Average that out to be about $10,000 per household times the number of households and you get $242,170,000 total income for the lowest quintile. Now assume that only half of them shop at Wal-Mart for groceries. The total income boost to the half of the lowest quintile that shop at Wal-Mart is $7,870,525 per year. TL;DR: The top 50% of households pay an extra $1.7 million a year to subsidize Wal-Mart which at the very least boosts the income of the lowest 10% of households by more than $7 million a year."
"I am a liberal but also a realist; if Walmart can staff their stores and pay these dirt cheap wages, why the hell wouldnt they? Because people will stop shopping there? No they wont. Walmart has zero incentive to behave any differently, and its their exploitive cutthroat approach that has made them as successful as they are. If anything is going to change, their hand needs to be forced, and not by natural forces but by government regulation that sets an ACCEPTABLE bottom level of living for employed persons in the US, and enforces it using minimum wage and safety net programs. "
This is what American capitalism is: socialism for the rich while the rest of us starve.
While this is bad for Americans One should remember that wages were high once upon a time and businesses were not laying off employees because of it. If the minimum wage were to be 11/hr then yes prices would go up but people would have more money so they could consumer goods at the increased price. Europeans pay much more for goods then we do as americans and their middle class lives more comfortably than ours... Must have something to do with the wages being higher there My biggest issue is that these corporations like walmart and apple now have so much money that they do not know what to do with it so they play politics and lobby. Increasing the minimum wage would be a good first step to stop that.
This applies to every minimum wage/low paying job. Not just Wal-Mart. 
"This completely ignores the taxes that the typical Walmart store creates, including millions in payroll taxes, sales taxes and corporate income taxes."
"Wal-Mart turned the notion of socialization of losses, privatization of profits into a science., gotta hand it to them."
"This article lacks any economic point. The price paid by Walmart is the market value for the labor. Walmart is not a monopsony. If other companies were significantly better, then people would work for them. Some may not have a choice (as Walmart will hire nearly anyone while others might be more selective in hiring), but most do. They make the choice to work at Walmart out of convenience or choice or for whatever reason. Apple profits are in no way related to its wages. Nor should they be. Apple is a luxury product retailer. It is selling goods well above the market rate because of its brand appeal. It is not selling normal goods. The profits are a function of this. Its higher status does not mean that the labor it buys is worth more. especially on the low end. Say I invented a machine to mine gold from sea water. The machine was completely automated. all it requires is someone to monitor it and replace modular components. It was very efficient and extracted all of the gold in the water it processed. I would make millions per hour. Would that mean that I should pay someone millions per hour to monitor it and replace its components? Of course not. The McDonalds example makes the least sense. It is highly automated with little room for advancement. Why would anyone seek it out as a career? It is tedious work with no value. At best, it serves as a way of offering experience. Nothing more. Why should the company pay more than it needs to pay? Does this Buchheit asshole pay twice as much when he goes to McDonalds because he can afford to? It would really help out the franchisee."
"Im 100% sure that Walmart execs know the exact statistics, and count it as a victory because its money that comes from someone elses pockets, and not theirs."
"You know what else is great about Walmart? When they open a new store, they demand incentives from the local governments, and their stores require road improvements to serve the store itself. Something else that taxpayers have to pick up on Walmarts behalf. "
They learned from the Oil Companies. Then they want tax breaks to locate stores in the District of Columbia and to retain the right to pay crap wages to their employees. What a great American success story.
"And if people gave a shit, they would stop shopping there. If you dont like what WalMart does, then take your money elsewhere."
"If money going to Walmart employees is the problem, why not just take away minimum wage laws and then take away welfare? Then, we can mow down child labor laws, truth-in-advertising laws, and health regulations, since all of these things get in the way of improving the shareholders bottom line. Because at the end of the day, arent they the _real_ victims?"
basically they are relying on the tax-payers to sustain their workers while they profit. VERY CAPITALISTIC.
How much does it cost the government to subsidize the unemployed?
they are the largest employer besides the US government... NO ONE trying to work 40 hours a week (and getting cut off at 38 to deny health care) should have to be on food stamps. yada yada about free market and all that- wal-mart is CREATING its own welfare state and a burden to the People. 
"Walmart drove out all of the mom and pop stores, and smaller stores that were their competition. Those stores also on average paid more to the line level employees than Walmart. Walmart can now pay what they want because there is nowhere else to go. Its also worth noting that the figures being used represent the average of full time employees. Many of their employees are kept an hour or two below full time and make much less than the $12.76/hr. they are also put on schedules that change often so getting a second job is quite difficult. Walmarts business practices have real social and economic consequences for the whole country. "
"And yet the GOP thinks business owners should get more tax breaks! Im glad u posted this, more people need to see this."
So... How many stores do they have in the US?

"The title implies that a WMT store creates new costs that werent there before. This isnt true. Without WMT, these employees would either be unemployed or working at other retail stores *also* paying a minimum wage. Theres very little other options. WMT doesnt move to California and steal Steve Jobs to work there. These people are unskilled labour. So we need to compare pre WMT to post WMT. Not current WMT to utopia WMT where they act just as you *think* they should, ignoring all laws of economics. Otherwise, with that standard being put in place, everybody costs the government some amount, because I can easily create a law or world where they would pay more. It doesnt make sense."
"but you see, thats the tax payers problem now, not Walmarts /s"
"Man people are blind... Without Walmart offering low skilled people jobs they would be even more dependent on the government. Its the seen vs the unseen. This is the same rationale that leads people to believe war, natural disasters and broken windows are good for the economy."
"Shouldnt the cost to taxpayers be compared to how much government subsidies these employees would use *if they werent employed at all*? Under the fantasy logic of this post, Wal-Mart could hire every unemployed person in the country and would suddenly cost taxpayers more money because of all those people using fewer government services than before. Heck, under this fantasy logic, I could give a homeless person a dollar and suddenly cost taxpayers thousands because I didnt give him more."
Government-assisted suicide: it just makes fiscal sense.
Sooo...what your saying is...im not saving money?
This is a good explanation on how to help the fast food and Wal-Mart workers. http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/how-to-help-fast-food-workers/
This is why I have never set foot in wal mart ... also I live in a town in NJ that stopped wal mart from opening a store here. Hate those fucking leaches 
"The modern US Corporate business model: Government subsidized costs, privatized profits. "
"The problem is less that of minimum wage, and more of the fact that we dont have a maximum wage. We should tie executive pay proportionally to worker pay. Limit the salary of a CEO to 200x (or something, thats an arbitrary number I pulled out of my ass) what the lowest paid workers in the company get. So, if they want to have people work at the $8 or so minimum wage we have now, the most the execs can be paid is 3.3 million. If the company is successful, then it can afford to pay its workers more, and it can raise the pay of the CEO accordingly as reward for good work. Thered still be a reason to improve the company, at every level, because the more successful it is, the more everybody gets paid, and if it is not successful, the CEO doesnt get to loot the company and escape with a golden parachute. Right now the CEO of McDonalds makes $20 million a year, and a *full time* minimum wage worker there makes $16,640 a year. Does the CEO of McDonalds work 1200x harder than the bottom workers? I can accept that he works hard. I can accept that he brings in enough money to the company that he should be paid a lot of money. But if they can afford to pay him $20 million, they can afford to pay everybody else a little more. And if you make it so its set in stone that as you get promoted within the company your pay will go up to a certain multiple of your original pay, like 2x for store manager, 20x for regional manager, something like that, imagine how hard people will work to be promoted. Maximum wage, not minimum wage. Lets make businesses a cooperative partnership between employees at all levels, instead of a system for exploitation."
"Thanks to the dictionary of numbers chrome extension, I now know that $5,815 is about what a CEO made in an hour in 2007."
"But they pay over $7B a year in taxes, so it evens out... Source: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=WMT+Income+Statement&amp;annual"
Fuck it all. Hail satan. 
"Alright, so Im open to arguments, but I dont know that this costing taxpayers $x per employee is a very fair claim to make. Now, to be clear: Im not referring to any shady hours-shifting to push people into part-time designations. The shitty nature of that kind of thing is a given. But, in terms of they pay so little that employees have to rely on government/taxpayer aid -- is that really a ***cost*** that Wal-Mart is ***creating***? I mean, if not for their employment at Wal-Mart, would these people not have to rely on ***more*** such aid? Given that, Wal-Mart would be ***reducing*** taxpayer costs to subsidize these people. The costs would exist regardless -- theyre just lesser if the person is working [at Wal-Mart]. Its not like if these people didnt work at Wal-Mart theyd suddenly disappear from existence; theyd still be reliant on government subsidies (and more-so). The aid is something that society is providing these people because they believe they should have certain needs met, expressed by a certain dollar value. If society is the relevant party looking to maintain such a quality of life for these people, ***shouldnt*** society be the one footing the bill for any shortfall?"
"OP should actually link the study, not some article that mentions it offhand. Indeed, the actual study claims that the cost is $1.7 million *per store*, not per employee. The breakdown is below: &gt;$58,228 ? reduced price lunches under the National School Lunch Program &gt;$29,588 ? reduced price breakfasts under the School Breakfast Program &gt;$355,350 ? subsidized housing assistance under the Section 8 Housing Program &gt;$165,000 ? for the Earned Income Tax Credit &gt;$251,706 ? for Medicaid enrollment under the BadgerCare+ Program &gt;$26,100 ? for assistance under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) &gt;$219,528 ? for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly Food Stamp Program) benefits under Wisconsin?s FoodShare Program &gt;$639,090 ? for Wisconsin Shares Child Care Subsidy Program benefits Without knowing anything about Wisconsin law, Im guessing that all of these government subsidies would remain if the employee were unemployed instead. Likewise, even if all of those Wal-Mart jobs magically turned into $10/hour positions at mom-and-pop stores, these people would still qualify for a lot of these subsidies. So its not that Wal-Mart is causing taxplayers a $1.7 million cost per store--its that poor people are generally a drag on taxpayers. (Not a value judgment, just a fact of welfare economics.) TL;DR: /r/politics really needs to read sources before upvoting."
This is called central planning in an economy.
Which is exactly why I am a proud member of Costco.
"Correction: the government offers the subsidies, so its their bad on that, and our bad for not voting people in that will change that, or not voting at all, more than likely....and its the employees bad for trying to turn a menial zero skillset job into a living....BUT.....thats what those programs are there for and Im happy to pay into them. Thats part of being a civilized society. You dont offer social programs and then bitch about them when its convenient for going after the boogie man: corporate america. Ive never been stuck working at a walmart. Im relatively sure it is a 100 percent voluntary process. Could someone crunch the numbers for me and tell me how much walmart employees would be costing us if walmart didnt exist and they had no job at all? Oh...look. I just did the numbers in my head and its fucktons more. "
"Replace Walmart with publicly traded big box retailer. Walmart is no saint, but they are not the problem. They are rational actors in our current system. "
"WalMart can apparently afford to pay millions in TV advertising to tell us how all their employees are going to be managers some day, but they cant afford to actually pay their workers enough to get them off welfare."
Thats crony-capitalism for you!
"On the other hand, if there werent Walmarts, there would be 300 unemployed people, requiring even more government aid. "
But... but I want the 60 cents off my family-size jar of peanut butter...
"In the last year, a super Walmart opened in my town of around 22000 people. In that time, no small local stores have closed and Walmart hired a few hundred people locally, including my son and many of his friends. As an added benefit, the only local chain grocery store had to lower their grocery prices because they now have competition."
"I dont get why Walmart is the big bad guy; a lot of places pay people low wages. Instead of turning this into an attack on an individual company to show how much of a villain they are, why not use this information to solve the problem and promote a higher minimum wage. Making Walmarts public image a little faction worse than it already is wont accomplish much change. Please note In my personal opinion our inflation devaluing the minimum wage is a bigger problem then the actual minimum wage. Inflation is the biggest legal heist ever. "
"Its all due to short term thinking: quarterly profit statements and bonuses, not long term investing and success http://www.businessinsider.com/why-economic-growth-is-so-slow-2013-7"
"Hooray for pseudo-science! Identify random facts, which when placed in a dubious context promote false conclusions! Have you stopped beating your wife yet Mr. Senator?!?"
"you mean people who make minimum wage cant have flat screen HDTVs, cable bill, cell phone, and buy weed?"
Loving the free market idealists defending these stores using the public coffers as their private piggy banks. 
What this study should say is all minimum wage paying stores are costing us per employee. The constant attempt to single out walmart is getting old. Mom and pop stores dont pay cashiers lavish salaries so focus on the wage gap instead of political targets.
Youd think the conservative factions in government would oppose this sort of government spending and take action to make sure that the taxpayers werent on the hook for exaggerated corporate profits.
Not this shit again. Tune into Reddit tomorrow for a study on McDonalds and minimum wage. I cant wait!
"and how exactly is this walmarts fault? Another way to look at this would be that Walmart serves the most needy, and that they actually provide jobs for the most needy - but hey..this is reddit. "
"They wouldnt be able to pay them such low wages if the fallback system (Food stamps, medicare, etc.) were more tightly restricted to those who truly need it. I have several scumbag family members who receive such benefits and they continue to work under the table jobs or low paying jobs such as these, the reason being that they will actually take a pay cut if the get a better paying job when the federal benefits are redacted. Its a catch 22, really, except theres no one to blame but us. I firmly believe that if we removed such aid (or capped it in some manner) then 1) people would have to get actual jobs that pay back into the economy, and 2) these jobs would have to pay more or people simply would not work them. "
How much would the same group of people cost taxpayers if they were unemployed?
Reading comments made me realize how MERICAN DREAM redditors are... and how much they want to blame the victims of poverty for their own poverty.
"I think my question would be to ask why is our tax dollars paying to keep Wal-Mart open and running, while I would guess the people running Wal-Mart arent even bothering to worry themselves with paying to keep it running themselves? Simplified; Why are our tax dollars used to keep Wal-Mart open and running while the executives &amp; owners of Wal-Mart basically have nothing to lose but everything to gain?"
"Microsoft does the same thing to the system but with contingent staffing rather than real employees. They recognize that each year, a contractor has to take 100 days off (http://www.directionsonmicrosoft.com/sample/DOMIS/update/2000/04apr/0400tf1b.htm). Now one might say it is the decision of the person to stay contracting, which is true. But you have to look at this from a different perspective. MSFT offers access to things that most other companies do not. Beyond the fun oh shiny, 100 days really is not a long enough period of time to land another gig once you have a few tours at MSFT under your belt. MSFT knows this and knows that people will continue to come back; there are plenty of times where an orange badge (temp) will be told about an opening coming up for a blue badge (fte) gig and that will keep them coming back year after year. When fte spots are traded between orgs as currency, and job security is used as a bargaining mechanism, there is little-&gt;no incentive for an employer to bring on extra headcount and expenses (they have to cover benefits, office space, etc) with a system in place they can milk. So what happens to the THOUSANDS of orange badges in the Seattle area who are without work at any given time because of this practice? Unemployment of course! Sure, there are many other ways these two do not parallel each other but it always shocked me that nobody tried to put an end to this cycle. Well thats not entirely true...MSFT found a loophole called vendors which allows for non 100-day breaks but I imagine its only a matter of time until a few vendors go after MSFT for the exact same thing as linked to above. I hated this process when bringing new people on my teams...I hated knowing that people busting their butts would never see an FTE role no matter how many open headcount spots there were. /rant **TL;DR** Walmart is not the only system leech. "
"Well, clearly the solution is to eliminate government subsidies for Wal-Mart employees. Those leeches."
Do people really shop here? 
So Im paying for about 5-6 Walmart employees. Who pays for the wars? 
"Firstly, how can the net impact of a business operations tax burden be calculated if you do not also consider the amount said business pays in taxes? Something the referenced article does not do as it was a piece more geared toward which company (of those they compared) pays the least/most. Secondly, you can argue all you want that part time employees or employees earning minimum wage create an increased tax burden in terms of the public services they might engage in. But why do they bear no responsibility in and of themselves? Why is there such a rush to label companies and businesses (who are paying their taxes as prescribed by law) as evil and not even question how the individual employee is making decisions that greatly affect their tax burden? How is there no culpability assigned to the individual? Lastly, it is not the role or responsibility of any citizen, corporation or business to ensure the income, health and well-being of anyone else. It is up to the individual to choose what path their life will take. What education they will obtain, what job they will engage in. "
"If you want to just give people money to live on, why the hell are you relying on a company to do that? Oh, big bad wal-mart doesnt want to pay more than it has to. DUH. The idea that we should look to fucking wal-mart or to politicians to make wal-mart fix the problem is mind boggling. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income -- Unconditional Basic Income. You give people enough money to survive. They want 2 ply toilet paper, an xbox and nice stuff? Well then they get a job if they can."
"Heres some random observations to throw out that can be taken however you want. Nobody is forcing you to work there (yet). Its not like there is a similar job that requires no qualifications, work history or degree/cert that is paying 15.00/hr and these poor souls happened to end up at the Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart can only pay so low because people are still lining up to work there. That being said, since the standard for being employed by Wal-Mart is ultra low, you usually get ultra-low quality employees. Now dont get me wrong, Wal-Marts business practices are transparently malicious, as to not hiring full time employees and the ultra-high turnover rate (which may be costing them more in the end). Anyhow, Im so sick of the sob story that Wal-Mart employees will never be able to afford med school on their salary. Give me a fucking break. If you can pass a drug test and know how to make yourself look somewhat presentable and are *actually a hard worker* (key point) there are jobs to be had where you can make well above Wal-Mart wages. Wages you can actually get yourself an education on. The only thing about it is it takes *lots and lots of hard work*. Something (judging books by their covers) that I dont think many hourly Wal-Mart employees are too acustomed to. Finally, The reason Wal-Mart is such a big issue is because when they build one the stores fucking *thrive*. My girlfriend and I absolutely disagree with Wal-Marts business practices. So ya know what? We dont shop there. Ever. People need to realize if you think Wal-Mart needs to pay their employees more, and really feel that strongly about it, maybe you should be paying Wal-Mart less. "
"But dont you see that this is a *good* thing? By allowing wallmart and other companies to pay their employees so little that they have to rely on government subsides, these companies are saving loads of money, which is *obviously* good, because the economy."
I love these threads where middle/high school kids on summer breaks discuss economics and how the largest/most successful retailer in the world knows nothing about running a company. I wonder how Walmart remains so successful even when it is screwing up so bad. Interesting.
"We need a bit of a shift so that we are taking from corporations profits instead of adding to the government deficit. The thing is, the government should be able to do something about it but they cant agree on what buttons to push so they end up taking the pitfall... Furthermore they probably let it happen since they get paid either way! Yikes man I hope in the future there is a bit of a better system."
"Wait....they employ 1.6 million low skill workers. Wouldnt those people need even more taxpayer money if they werent making $26,000/yr from Walmart? So how is that a cost to taxpayers? Also, does the cost they came up with include the taxes the stores pay? The stores pay sales tax, state taxes, property taxes and federal taxes. We can have discussions about minimum wage without having to make stuff up. This article was horrible."
"Mankind is divided into rich and poor, into property owners and exploited; and to abstract oneself from this fundamental division; and from the antagonism between poor and rich means abstracting oneself from fundamental facts. "
Wal-Mart CEOs campaign contribution paid off.
"Wal-Mart would say that they save Americans much more than 1.7 mil a year with their low prices. Ya know, turn it into a positive light for them, even though every one knows Wal-Mart is evil. So evil, Id bet they would throw shoplifters into a pool of sharks with laser beams attached to their heads, if they were allowed to."
"Simple solution, just stop shopping there. I dont and Ive noticed I really dont need to surround myself with cheap useless shit. Youre better off visiting /r/DIY and making the same products Shitmart sells and saving money over the long term because it will more than likely last longer and more importantly wont get sucked into their deals of more useless garbage."
"Not even getting in to the environmental cost of selling cheap shit made in China that winds up in the landfill before it ought to. Not getting in to the predatory pricing schemes they use to drive local business out, drive down taxable wages, and kill revenue to municipalities. The shareholders are happy though as business without a conscience is always profitable. All of this in the name of saving a few pennies."
"Really what this means is Wal Mart owes each of its employees a $6,000 annual raise."
So I dont have to feel as bad shopping there anymore since Im paying them indirectly anyways? ...is that how this works?
I JUST bought some cat food and cat litter at a walmart by my work here in wisconsin. Am I going to hell because it was the closest place to buy cat food near my work and I was only on my lunch break so i didnt have any time to go further. fml
Is anyone else like me and be all anti walmart online but then you shop there anyways cuz its just so much cheaper it wouldnt make sense to shop at whole foods or new leaf or target 
How much does each soldier cost us? Id rather subsidize a civilian corporation that is providing cheap nick-nacks than subsidize the bombing of brown people. Call me crazy. Im just not a fan of bombing brown people.

"What about the millions of people that work jobs that pay less than Walmart? I wonder how much they cost? I look at it the opposite way. Walmart and other low wage jobs are offering a service to our nation. They are employing many who have refused to educate themselves, stay out of legal trouble or refuse to conform to social norms (neck and face tats etc.) These jobs are doing a great service to our nation by subsidizing those who already receive government assistance."
"This reminds me, I am WAY behind on my shoplifting."
"Guess those prices arent so low, huh."
Why is it always Wal-mart? Damn near every major supermarket in America pays their employees minimum wage too.
Or they could just pay their workers.
So if the Walmart didnt exist and these people had no job the government wouldnt be paying anything? Retarded stat. 
"The giant, amoral, moocher corporations are a true blight on this nation."
"Why do people NOT understand...this isnt a problem caused by WALMART...it is a problem caused by the mentality, that a wal mart job is supposed to be able to support a family....this simply is NOT the case, and people need to understand this..."
"Wouldnt it cost us just as much if not more if they werent employed? Walmart is gonna sell shitty stuff, pay low wages, and haters gonna hate. Dont shop there if you hate the store."
This is all policy from Jesus/Republicans. They understand a good man wants to get rich off the backs of the poor and not allow them access to medicine.
"I love how these Nutters are defending Walmarts practices. These are probably the same people pissed that people get assistance in the first place. Which is it because it cant be both. Either Walmart is bad for providing work but not at a living wage so we have to pick up the slack, or Walmart is awesome because we pick up the slack where they FAIL and they laugh themselves silly all the way to the bank. Frankly when someone is screwing me, I dont ask for more of the same, and I sure as hell dont applaud them for it. "
"Im sure its just the cost of doing business - our cost, society suffers."
"Minimum wage increase or subsidies, doesnt matter, wealth re-distributed. Just sucks that tax payers that dont shop at wal-mart have to chip in."
"The real question is what would people rather pay, higher prices at walmart or higher taxes? Id rather distribute the cost to taxpayers if it meant lowering prices for stores where the poor mostly shop. Then again, how much of that goes to Walmart and not the employees?"
"Am I the only person that sees that the clear problem is that there are thousands of underemployed people and that the solution is to create higher paying higher skilled jobs? There will always be demand for unskilled low paying jobs, theyre called teenagers. The real problem is that grown adults *shouldnt* be working minimum wage jobs for extended periods of time. The reason they are today is because the economy is still suffering and they are underemployed. So, instead of making their lives easier flipping burgers (which generates almost no benefit for society) we should be finding ways to either give them the necessary skills to move on or create more jobs that require the skills they have."
"Its not directly relevant, but something this reminds me of is Chomskys comments on the hidden costs of privatization and/or cutting public services. It may look efficient on a state budget, but cutting corners that way can lead to unintended side effects."

"People are not responsible for themselves. Its the governments duty to protect us from ourselves by: *) being sure our employers are forced to respond to populist pressure instead of market pressure *) being sure we are paid more than we are worth which raises the cost of goods and lowers the standard of living for everyone who succeeded *) propagandizing us from childhood to believe that if anyone doesnt like something, they hate... that if anyone is successful its because of their parents money, their evil doings, and the color of their skin... that people who overborrow and overspend for their education in an unmarketable subject are victems... that if you fail... it isnt your fault. No one is responsible for themselves. I think its fine for people to talk about how Walmart should pay more, or McDonalds, or whatever else... What I dont think is okay is the willful ignorance of the statement a mother of two working full time at Walmart... If you work at Walmart you probably shouldnt be a mother of two. You probably should have done something with your life instead of breaching two welfare children before you could be worth more than $10 per hour. You should probably take a little responsibility for yourself. NPR had a gentleman on yesterday who works at Burger King and makes ~$9/hr and was protesting and demanding more money. He kept making reference to not being able to support the family of 4. He talked about his wife going back to school to become a nurse assistant. That is a job that requires very little training and is essentially a janitorial job... emptying bedtrays and giving spongebaths. Its not exactly going back to school. If you want to succeed, learn something the market will pay for. If you want to succeed, dont stay working at Burger King... Spend your off hours applying for jobs rather than complaining on the radio. If you want to succeed, take out student loans and go back to school to learn a real trade that pays real money at a technical college or inexpensive 4 year university. If you live somewhere (like MA, PA for instance) where 4 year schools are $30k/y+ THEN MOVE AWAY. Dont take out $120k in loans to pay for school that you could get for $30k!!! Its cheaper to move to SC and pay out of state tuition than to attend many colleges which is why my school is full of people from out of state. My school advertises in these markets for just this reason. There is a way. You have to be responsible for yourself. You have to wake up and decide to actually do something about it. Or you could just keep QQing."
"A better question is What is the difference in cost to the taxpayer if Walmart employees were employed by someone else? If they had a poorly paid job elsewhere, the problem would still be there, but some other mom and pop retailer might be getting the government subsidy. People work at Walmart because the market doesnt offer any better jobs. The little retailers that Walmart put out of business are just as crappy. [Mean hourly wage](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes412031.htm) of retail is $12.17, a tiny bit less than the $12.78 that Walmart pays. edit: [according to BLS, cashiers](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes412011.htm) get an average of $9.79 and a median of $9.12. Given that Walmart associates a mix of floor workers and cashiers, this makes Walmart look a bit better. "
maybe we should just cut away the government subsidies then.
So Walmart cant pony up another few million in payroll to get these people out of poverty? We should be ashed to shop there. 
"Anyone have the number of stores to extrapolate Walmarts cost to the tax payers overall? Id look but Im mobile. Edit: Holy damn, 4,253 stores total. So someone else said the realistic estimate was more like $900,000 per store on average so at 4,253 stores that would be $3,827,700,000 annually. That is quite a bill for the taxpayers to be pony up."
"If you cut the benefits, the wages would have to rise to where one could live at a low level on it or the local prices would have to fall."
Passing the savings on to themselves rolling back the economy
What revenues does each Walmart bring? 
Sounds like that is working as intended.
"So heres the $1.7 million question. Do we blame Walmart for hiring workers at market rate, or the US government for giving handouts to people who have jobs?"
"This suggests to me that the public should stop subsidizing Wal-Marts expenses by ending the provision welfare and government health care, so that Wal-Mart would be *forced* to bear the full cost of employing its employees instead of being *enabled* to offset their expenses onto the public. "
How much do single moms cost society?
Will raising the minimum wage eliminate these subsidies?
Republican answer? Get rid of the subsidies. 
"Next up, re-legalization of slavery, to improve corporate profits. "
Shouldnt government assistance be pegged to working 25 hours @ minimum wage or something...that would force them to either raise minimum wage so that these people dont rely on assistance or cut assistance down and deal with those consequences. This is ridiculous and allows these companies to game the system knowing that the government will pick up the rest of the tab.
"Odd how this thread assumes that everyone on the government tit is just dying to get off, yet the numbers of them keep rising. What to do? Blame the biggest guy in the room. Most people who collect from the government fuckin love it and they live in that system of barely give and plenty take. Why work extra hours or get a better job when that magic check just keeps appearing?!"
I wonder how much a typical Target store costs taxpayers. Or a typical Dicks sporting goods store? 
"From the first page of the study, the actual number was around $3,000, not $5,815. It says could cost up to 5,815. Whenever you see the words up to, you know somebody is blowing smoke at you. This was prepared by the staff of a democratic subcommittee of congress. Any idea what a typical democratic subcommittee costs the taxpayers? Hint: its a lot more than $5,815. "
"So, basically, we should shop at Walmart since were already paying for Walmart in some way. "
I only buy ammo at walmart. Everything else they sell is garbage. 
"Without walmart, is it possible the cost to the taxpayers would be even higher? Even underpayed make more than unemployed."
"Its gotta come from somewhere and if you dont produce anything, further anything or technologically advance anything, its gotta come from somewhere else."
"The crazy part is that even though I am currently sitting on my lunch break from Walmart (where I have worked full time for the last seven years) I have never been eligible for any state or federal aid. Granted I am a single male with no children. I agree that this company needs to pay its associates better and even in some stores treat them better (however the treatment of associates is very dependent on the management team). I have a unique perspective in this company because I have climbed the ranks into salaried management and through some health issues had to step down to take care of myself. I can honestly say that at least within most regions the stores and associates and management mean well as a whole. Some of the policies can be crazy at times but honestly I have been paid and treated worse at other companies. However, YMMV dependent on the management team involved."
Where else am I supposed to buy the cheap crap I dont need? Target? Fred Meyer? Costco? 
This is the kind of stuff that make people want to raise the minimum wage to outrageous levels. ...not that I can blame them. Id rather not have to subsidize EVERY SINGLE Wal-Mart. 
Whyd they have to test in Wisconsin? I have a feeling there is at least one comment bashing Wisconsin...
"the company pays extraordinarily low wages to its store workers, an average of about $12 per hour, or $24,000 per year for a full-time employee. In-store salespeople make up about half of the total workforce Apple pays its U.S. employees only $1 for every $8 in profits. Are people going to ignore this and continue to rip on walmart and mcdonalds because they are perceived as evil capitalists? But its a living wage!"
Seems like majority of our taxes help the very few and multi-national corporations and leave the rest of us in the dark. This on top of the recent study on how 121% of economic growth since the recession went to the corps and 1%. 
The problem is that if you try to fix some part another is going to break. There is no way to win... WHERES YOUR GOD NOW!?
Wow. So how much does someone who doesnt have a job at all cost?
Sometimes I hate learning these fun little facts.
"And in return for those costs, Wal-Mart gives us *Great Value*."
"Hows that expanded tax base, you moronic cities!"
Solution: Stop shopping there. Nothing else will change anything.
employees reliance on government subsidies does that mean welfare/food stamps?
This thread: People defending Wal-Mart barely paying their employees. I will never understand you silly americans.
"And every year, the members of the Wall family are on the very top of monied people in the world. Theyve gotten there with our taxpayer dollars and their disregard for their employees."
"Funny, at the same time this study was published, Walmart was advertising on every cable news network. Kind of neat how that works out."
As opposed to all those people being unemployed and 100% reliant on government? You know what costs taxpayers money - public sector jobs that pay 30% more than their private sector counterparts.
"Was this study from the same KU freshman that decided that doubling McDs payroll would add 60 cents to the Big Mac, that was TOTALLY debunked within 24 hours?"
"If I want to see intelligent responses to this, Ill just scroll to the bottom of the page where theyve all been buried by the reddits Wal-Mart employees."
"Whenever I hear A study... I tend to just assume its bullshit these days. Accountability in journalism has died off, its very sad"
"And the Teabaggers will continue to shop there. Low prices, low morals. "
"Well, but how much does the average unemployed person cost taxpayers? Its not $0, but is is more than or less than $5,815 (i.e., how much does this save/cost relative to an unemployed person). Not saying that Wal-Mart has any intention other than maximizing its profits, however, the most relevant statistic(s) arent discussed here."
"so this is pretty common knowledge but what continually mystifies me is that small business owners believe the GOP lie that whats in the best interests of the gigantic corporations that the GOP is bending over backwards for is indistinguishable from whats in their own best interests... ???? if anything, a small business owners interests are far more aligned with welfare recipients than they are with walmart! theyre certainly far closer in terms of revenue and profit taken in."
"I know this will get buried, but the math seems unlikely. In order for those figures ($1.7M per store and $5,815 per employee) to be accurate, each Wal-Mart store would need 292 employees."
"Is it possible that this is the sign of a functioning welfare system rather than an exploitative corporate system? Maybe the people who work at walmart arent contributing enough to the economy for the economy to support them, so the government is stepping in to make up the difference. Honestly I think this is probably a better option than doubling or tripling the minimum wage. As nice as raising the minimum wage that much sounds, do you really think that a Walmart shelf stocker should be paid as much as an entry level teacher or other professional? People should be paid based on how much they contribute, and if that isnt enough to live on, then its the governments job to step in and make up the rest so we all have a reasonable standard of healthcare, nutrition, etc."
And how much do those people being unemployed cost taxpayers?
But the prices are so cheap!! The real price tag is hidden from the consumer who doesnt have the brains to realize what is happening. Its why a free market isnt really fair when a large percentage of the participants are not aware of the true costs.
"I work there, I dont take any taxpayer money, but then again I live with a bunch of people sharing rent so yeah still a shit pay. "
I know we have lost a lot of freedoms in this country but you still have freedom of choice. People dont have to work at wal-mart. People dont have to shop at wal-mart. The market will take care of itself. And just for the record my daughter works at wal-mart.
raise wages now please
"For comparison, the economic impact of a Walmart store averages about $150 million (assuming a 3.0 multiplier)"
And yet people will still shop at WalMart
So when do we begin the uprising and kill all of those that prosper off of the backs of (almost) slave labor... ...just need a time and location of when I need to show up with my pitchfork outside of one of the Waltons homes.
"Wal-Mart is not the selective service. You are not drafted into a job at Wal-Mart, you apply for it."
"ITT: People still believe what they already did, based on political persuasion."
Am I the only one who thinks that the author used Apple in his article just to generate page views?
"Am I the only one who thinks being paid minimum wage to work at McDonalds and $12/hr to work at Walmart/Apple store is completely acceptable? I mean I get that theres people that get 100% of there pay from these jobs but lets be real people, fucken burger flippers get minimum wage, thats the rules of life."
"It seems like no one has addressed the point that Walmart paid $6 billion in US federal and state taxes in 2009 (for example). With more than 4,000 locations in the US, that works out to $1.3 million in taxes per location (guessing 4500 locations), which is $400,000/yr more than the actual guess this study puts forward of $900,000/yr in government welfare. Things should be put in context."
Just think how much more it would cost tax payers if Walmart didnt employee them. Stupid article. 
WOW a STUDY!!! it must be true
isnt this also assuming that the walmart employees are also full time?
How much do taxpayers pay for people in jail for cannabis? 
"The main point is, the Walton family is the richest family in the entire world while Walmart employees do all the work and dont even get a living wage for that work. That employees (that is all of us) pay the taxes that support them because the Walton family wont raise their wages. Something is going to give way -- and soon. Raise the minimum wage to a living wage before there is rioting and civil war. WE CAN STOP THIS! We can stop the wars to come. Just raise the minimum wage until people are able to survive. That is how you end rebellion. Listen, if you dont support the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013, the U.S. will be thrown into civil unrest by 2015. Ive seen this all before. Ive studied history. Raise the minimum wage or face the consequences. "
"I know this certainly isnt a popular opinion here, but businesses are not the ones who set the low wages for employees who work at places such as Wal-Mart. How much should an employee of Wal-Mart make? What true skills do these workers have that gives them a competitive advantage over another that would allow for a higher wage than someone else? If you pay someone at Wal-Mart $15 an hour, what does a teacher deserve to make? What does an accountant deserve to make? What does an actuary deserve to make? What does a soldier deserve to make? People are paid (for the most part) what their skill set permits. Wouldnt these increases in wages then allow for businesses to charge more for their products and then, proportionately, the majority would still be in the same position they are in? Goodbye sweet karma."
"Pretty much a bullshit analysis, but it is certain to entertain the low information liberals in r/reddit."
So if Wal-mart didnt exist these people would magically have higher paying jobs? Right.. Every economic study shows that when you raise minimum wage there are less jobs. So you want to permanently take away jobs from people that are willing to do it? How much does a permanently unemployed person cost to support? What does that do for their psyche?
"Anyone who thinks that raising the minimum wage will fix everyones problems is SADLY mistaken. When you increase the minimum wage it costs companies more to make their items, and guess how they are going to recuperate that? Exactly!! To the people that say but walmart employees are un skilled laborers, how much do they deserve to make? Well Costco pays its employess an average of 17/hour with benefits. Oh, and they let their employees work 40 hours a week so they can qualify for benefits. Walmart is NOTORIOUS for having employees work 36 hour weeks just so they dont qualify for health coverage...now that is scandalous. "
TIL a typical Wal-Mart store employs 292 people.... Yeah right... 
"Did they factor in the much lower employment rate were Walmart not there?...I, honestly, didnt read it...but I dont understand how Walmart literally costs taxpayers money (unless theyre cashing in on energy or something)"
"I was down South recently. In this poor town in Oklahoma, they were practically begging for employees, especially in Wal-Mart. Never seen this anywhere. There were tons of people shopping in there, but I think most of them were on welfare. I saw the same people working in the morning AND in the evening! I came back twice in the same day. Its sad. Wal-Mart is the worst run company. I worked for them a bit when I was younger. I lasted about a month. The people that kept working there after I left look like shells of their former selves. Every time I go shop there, its like going to hell and seeing lost souls. The smarter ones usually escape after a few years though."
Yeah. And our local governments give them MORE via TIF and shit like that. ARGHHHHHH
"&gt; Because of varying program eligibility requirements across states, extrapolating taxpayer costs for Wal-Mart stores in other states based on the Wisconsin data is difficult. Wisconsin?s poverty rate stands well under the national average, so it would be reasonable to assume that the households of Wal-Mart employees in other states would be more likely to qualify for public assistance. On the other hand, Wisconsin?s Medicaid program eligibility requirements are more inclusive than other states?, meaning many WalMart employees in other states could find themselves ineligible for Medicaid while their Wisconsin counterparts of equivalent incomes would be eligible. Um... yeah, not very good science here."
Why the fuck does everyone hate wal-mart so much that theyll upvote this without reading the study... which is blatantly biased and not based in good science? 
Well thats less money than having these people simply on welfare so whats the problem ?
I dont know why you are complaining. /r/politics seems overwhelmingly in favor of the government picking up the tab for everything anyway.
I get all my taxes back. Im poor too.
Why is using government programs considered a shameful thing? 
"Because the workers wouldnt rely on government aid if they didnt work at walmart, right?"
"And rather than suggest walmart pay more, the gop is trying to just get rid of the subsidies for the employee."
So lets say that Wal Mart could replace a lot of their employees with robots and automation at the check out aisle. Thats the plan long term anyway. At that point what does it matter how much employees are being paid when there are less jobs? Youre worried about subsidising workers? When the US has perpetual 15-20% unemployment we will beg for the return of the evil days of corporate employers like Wal Mart. Another thought is why doesnt a store like Target take a more social angle and pay their employees more and sell it that way publicly kind of like Costco? I think that would be a good move for them in theory. Maybe the real problem is that would not improve their sales at all and the consuming public in general doesnt care. 
"Maybe I missed it, but where is the study and who did it? Maybe Im blind, but I didnt see that information in there which is kind of important and interesting. "
Think how much they would cost if they didnt have Wal-Mart to work at.
"Wal-Mart is no different than most other big box stores in this regard, but in a normal economy, the people that should be working at Wal-Mart are high schoolers and college kids. I think that the conversion to robotics will turn those jobs into moderately skilled labor. Someone on site will likely be required to have the skills to fix it, so we should be seeing a wage bump soon... just not the one that people would like. The main gripe that people should have with Wal-Mart is their horrible service, most of the time. I dont shop there because of that, not because of what the market is charging for non-skilled labor."
"Im a bit late to the party, but have two links to share: Walmart isnt the only company guilty of huge profits while their employees take home squat, fast food companies like McDonalds and its wage war has been gaining publicity. Heres an enlightening clip from the Colbert Report I saw last month: [Colbert slams the laughable McDonalds budget](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/427948/july-22-2013/minimum-wage---mcdonald-s-spending-journal) which stipulates that if you get a second job, work 75 hours a week, pay $0 for heat, $20 for health care (that would be a government plan, as McDonalds insurance plan is closer to $60 if you qualify), and $0 on food you can even save $100 a month! While searching for that link, I also found this article. It has some good information while advocating against minimum wage increases: [Forbes on minimum wage nuances](http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2013/07/23/mcdonalds-minimum-wage-budget-ignores-tax-credits-food-stamps-and-reality/)"
mabey we should cut the subsidies?
We go into 1 trillion bucks of debt per year so... no biggie right?
"Doesnt take into consideration how much taxes Walmart paid ([$7.1 billion in 2012](http://www.forbes.com/2011/04/13/ge-exxon-walmart-apple-business-washington-corporate-taxes.html)), or how much Walmart saves consumers ([about $50 billion a year](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/27/AR2005112700687.html)). If anything, Walmart tends to disproportionately benefit the poor. "
"This is really misleading. When you say X costs taxpayers $Y per year the implication is that the budget in question *would have $Y more* if X did not exist. Walmart pays them very little money, sure, but if Walmart did not exist, these employees would make even less, and they would be *more* dependent on taxpayer funds. So Walmart may have awful wages, but it *is* a net benefit to taxpayers."
And thats where your low-low prices come from. I hear there appear to be a lot of empty wal-marts. I dont know how that works actually. How come these wal-marts are abandoned? 
"At a certain point, electoral politics starts to seem superfluous. There are really a handful of families bankrolling the republican party (Koch Brothers in energy/paper; Waltons in retail) to keep very particular forms of government regulation in place. Why not go after these people directly instead of going through the unwieldy process of winning control of all three branches of government?"
wish corporations like this that had employees on food stamps and subsidies were forced to pay the difference in addition to their regular corporate tax. Might encourage them to raise wages a little bit.
Walmarts philosophy seems to be race to the bottom. On employee wages and benefits. On American goods vs cheap crap chinese ones. [On providing a place to shop where one doesnt encounter feces.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtnhNVakqjQ) The problem with race to the bottom is that you reach the bottom. 
So each wal mart employes close to 300 people? I thought it would be closer to around 50 or 60...
ultimately this is all because of a miserably failed 30 year trickle down economics policy. the idea was to free up some money to corporations so they could better compensate employees. guess what? corporations simply decided to keep all the extra. these stories are the end result. it looked good on paper. not so much in practice. this bullshit has to end.
"Except that the very core of economic development is material wealth, inherently controlled by geography. Your statement requires a level of historical myopia that unfortunately is shared by most who agree with your opinions, and seems to be necessary to hold them."
I have a few friends who definitely DONT need food stamps and are perfectly able to afford food themselves. But why turn down free money? So maybe the common sense question this study brings up is: maybe we should take a good hard look at just how much were wasting on food stamps in this country. 
I read the study behind the title of this thread. It is 99% polemic and 1% unsupported facts. Walmart may indeed be bad for our society but there is no factual support for the assertion in the title of this thread.
"Have you been to Walmart? Are we assuming that without Walmart, those employees would have better jobs? Or that if Walmart just paid more....all their employees would be that much better off? Certainly Walmarts success is driven by their cheap prices. Do you think Id tomorrow they doubled everyones salary, theyd continue yo be as successful and employ the same number of people?"
Just commenting to keep this link in my history.
"This. In the 1970s the department of Housing and Urban Development, responsible for providing housing to the poor, *spent more money on administration and other overhead than they did actually building housing.*"
"Citation? A more relevant comparison, Medicare (a government-run healthcare service), currently (not 40 years ago) spends &lt;2% on administrative costs and overhead. Well below the 10-15% overhead of private insurers.[^(1)](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/30/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-medicare-overhead-far-lower-pri/) &gt; The trustees? summary listed total Medicare expenditures of $522.8 billion for 2010, of which **$7 billion was characterized as administrative expenses. That works out to 1.3 percent** - &gt; CBO cited data, compiled by the McKinsey Global Institute, that estimated administrative costs for private insurers at 12 percent [...] A different measurement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pegged the amount for private insurers at 11.1 percent for 2009"
"I cant dig up a citation quickly on the internet, its a factoid I learned many years ago in economics, when it was still a contemporaneous issue. As for your data - I dont buy it, because I dont believe that the numbers correctly reflect the inefficiency of the system, but instead paint the picture that the trustees wish to paint. Look - Im a business process expert, and I dont make that claim lightly. Ive done a lot of work helping businesses become more efficient. So I pretty much vomit every time I have to encounter the healthcare system (and note - I in NO WAY defend the employer-based private insurance system that preceded Obamacare). Ive worked with businesses so lean its hard to believe they are able to function at all - you walk in a factory and it almost looks like its gone out of business. So it doesnt take me three minutes of experience with the Medicare system to know that there is an enormous, unaccounted-for, heaping, steaming pile of waste - and fraud - buried within every Medicare payout. For instance I understand that for every hour of patient services, it requires 1/2 hour to complete the Medicare-specific paperwork - but this isnt accounted for by your numbers, since its assumed in the cost of the medical service being billed and simply appears to Medicare as a beneficiary payout. TL;DR 1. the employer-based insurance system is a bad system 2. but the idea that Medicare is not just more efficient than private insurance - but at &lt;2% overhead possibly the most efficient service-delivery business *in the world* - is so patently false that we should begin by fundamentally distrusting the numbers presented."
How do you get by every day while being so racist?
&gt; This is devastating news for the anti-gun crowd It can be viewed that way.

"Yes, Independents are more likely to vote for Republicans than Democrats in no small part because the Republicans have been driving them away from party affiliation in their demand for ideological purity.

The one Tides Foundation made a total of 2,627 grants worth $143,529,590 in 2010. Last, because the Kochs and Liberals see eye to eye on [various issues](http://www.mediaite.com/online/david-koch-supports-gay-marriage-pot-legalization-and-ending-wars-and-you-shouldnt-be-surprised/) So, its hard to take anyone seriously when they argue with the Kochs because these people dont have a problem with Money in Politics, they have a problem with Money in Politics that they dont agree with.

Getting upvotes for labeling some one a racist is pretty lame without at least citing some references to back it up.

"Have you read Buffets views on the ACA ? http://www.factcheck.org/2013/09/warren-buffett-on-obamacare/ He think that the ACA did not go far enough, but the scrap it comment was taken deeply out of context. His points are all reasonable - I get the impression he really wants single payer."

&gt;increasing government regulation on newly fired coal plants is making coal plants more expensive. The costs of govt regulation can be see as the true cost of coal where without it there are costs of damage to the environment and peoples health that arent considered.
"[They horde it.](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/08/one-wisconsin-now/just-how-wealthy-wal-mart-walton-family/) Think about it, if you gave someone who is living paycheck to paycheck an extra $100 a month, what are they going to do with it? Spend the majority of it right? Now if you give the Waltons an extra $100 a month, what are they going to do with it? Well considering that they are already sitting on a pile of money, I imagine its just going to go in the pile. Also, you say no wealth is created and thats a fallacy. If enough people start making more money, than they are going to buy more things and its going to increase demand to the point where companies will have to higher more people to make the things people are demanding which now means we have more people working, more money, more demand. This is how we grow the economy and create new wealth."
"&gt;You are discounting so many things like how an increase in wages for people who end up spending 100% of their money juices the economy in a multiplying manner. The minimum wage is a transfer of wealth, correct? We say walmart should pay more thus transferring the wealth from one party to another. No wealth is created and an increase in the minimum wage doesnt magically make money appear in the economy. So that being said, how is this any different than what is already happening? In other words, what do the Waltons (or whomever) do with their money that prevents it from juicing the economy in a multiplying manner? "
"&gt;Also, you say no wealth is created and thats a fallacy. If enough people start making more money, than they are going to buy more things and its going to increase demand to the point where companies will have to higher more people to make the things people are demanding which now means we have more people working, more money, more demand. This is what Im asking you to prove. You cannot use it as your conclusion and as the basis for which youve arrived at your conclusion. &gt;They horde it. Well unless they stuff it in their mattress, youre incorrect. &gt;Think about it, if you gave someone who is living paycheck to paycheck an extra $100 a month, what are they going to do with it? Spend the majority of it right? Now if you give the Waltons an extra $100 a month, what are they going to do with it? Well considering that they are already sitting on a pile of money, I imagine its just going to go in the pile. Yes youre right if you give someone living paycheck to paycheck more money they will spend it. If you give the Waltons more money they do not sit on the pile. What they really do with it is invest it or put it back into their company or put it in a bank. In all these scenarios the money is still going back into the economy. So it doesnt matter who you give it to. If the Waltons put it in a bank, the bank lends it to a company or a person who then spends it. If they invest it, the entrepreneur or company they invested in will spend it and it will still go back into the economy. So you still havent proven how it goes into the economy for one party and not the other. If rich people stuffed it into their mattress or something, yes youd be correct but a rich person who does that wont be very rich for long. So the argument that the economy is juiced is patently false."
"&gt;Socialized health care systems get better results This is subjective. There are certainly plenty of examples that we can cite where the US is exceedingly better. Something like 30,000 Canadians go to other countries and pay when they could get treated for free, 25% of people in Canada going in for surgery wait a month or more for that surgery and up to ten weeks for an MRI just to diagnose. In survival rates of cancer patients the US leads the world. We receive the benefits of the latest pharmaceuticals sometimes years before theyre available to UK or Canada. So again, I dont think the blanket statement better results applies. &gt;for cheaper If I walk into your grocery store and you try to charge me $10 for a bag of apples and I flash a gun or badge or something and tell you, Well Im only going to pay $3. That doesnt mean it was *cheaper* for you to provide those apples to me. The cost is the cost. Just because we let guys with guns and special privileges tell us what to buy, doesnt mean the cost of providing that service changes. Its really not as cut and dried as everyone in this subreddit, and every other liberal for that matter, would like to believe. This is a matter of fact."
"&gt;Stupid fucking argument when in the neighborhood of a million Americans go out-country every year for healthcare tourism. Relevant argument considering Americans dont get it for free. Canadians do. If you get it for free, why choose to pay? If you have to pay then you choose the best mix of price and quality for you. If you dont have to pay then it would be completely irrational to opt to pay, right? &gt;For non-emergency care, yes. How does that compare to the US? I dont think it matters if its emergency or non-emergency care. In an economic transaction resources have to be rationed and I would consider getting care quicker to be maybe, just a little, tiny, benefit of health care. &gt;My god you are hitting all the highnotes on bullshit lies about single payer healthcare. Do you read from a playbook or do you actually believe the shit you are spewing? Where is the lie? The source you cited says what I said, no? From your source: &gt;It?s certainly the case that we have higher survival rates than the United Kingdom and other countries with nationalized health care. Across the board, the United States boasts a higher five-year relative survival rate than the European average, according to a 2008 study in the British medical journal Lancet. For breast cancer, for instance, the U.S. survival rate was 83.9 percent, the U.K. rate was 69.7, and the average European rate was 73.1. Thats what I said. I didnt say anything about insured vs uninsured so your article does not address the claim at hand. Then they make the argument that the US is only better because it catches it earlier by saying this: &gt;Thus, countries with more advance screening will have higher survival rates even if they don?t have better post-diagnosis care. Well I would consider more advanced screening to be higher quality. I think the source you cited actually proves my claim. Thank you."

"Id rather have a Clinton than a Bush in office, but lets not give him a complete pass. He did sign [the law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm?Leach?Bliley_Act) repealing the Glass-Steagall restrictions on financial shenanigans, which was one of the leading factors in the financial meltdown of 2008."
"Clinton could have easily fucked up the economy during that expansion, too. For example, he raised taxes on some in order to cut down the deficit. If he had lowered taxes and continued to increase deficit spending during this economic boom we would be in far worse shape now than we are. http://www.factcheck.org/2007/12/clinton-and-economic-growth-in-the-90s/"
How do you spend money on tax cuts?
Dont forget Medicare Part D
This is a pretty tired talking point. In 2006 deficits were climbing AND Democrats knew they werent putting the country in any danger of a defaulting. Neither of those things can be said today.
Full text and further information: http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/debtlimit.asp 
"Just wondering if you knew that every single democrat senator voted against raising the debt limit in 2006. Here is a quote you might think is from some GOP politician: Increasing America?s debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means the buck stops here. Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. Therefore I intend to oppose the effort to increase America?s debt limit. This is actually a quote from Barack Obama."
When he was in the minority party? Because thats has often been the standard case when in the minority party and you know it passes anyways. Not saying it isnt stupid or petty but it isnt close to the same as what the house is currently doing 
"Democrats had the option of threatening or starting filibuster on this issue but did not. That alone indicates the Democrats plan to make a symbolic gesture, not actually bring the government to its knees."
"Anyone who has followed politics since Tip ONeil/Reagan must realize that debt ceiling debates have a long history of being used by both sides for political grandstanding. They make for great drama--accuse the other side of being feckless while using the staggeringly large numbers as a moral bludgeon--but the thing is, everyone knows (or used to know) that the measure was going to pass, that nobody would let the U.S. actually go into default. Congressional leaders may be incompetent in, you know, actually leading, but one thing they do well is count votes. If the outcome were in any doubt in 2006, theres no way the Senate Dems would have voted as they did. They knew they could make a symbolic gesture, score some opportunistic political points, and then get the debt limit increase everyone wanted anyway. This is in no way equitable with the present situation, for which there is no historical precedent. (The closest parallel was when the Democratically controlled House held the debt ceiling hostage trying to get concessions in 1984 from the Reagan White House, but they capitulated after a single day.) A plurality of Congress members actually are looking forward to a default for reasons that are difficult to fathom. They are sprinting toward that cliff and the fallout ([Goldman predicts drawback of 4.2% GDP](http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-on-failure-to-raise-the-debt-ceiling-2013-10) if we hit the limit) could be staggering. "
No one thinks it is good to have so much debt. But just stopping paying bills is not the solution.
The debt limit is a manufactured problem.
"Yea, they were being douches. That doesnt justify the same douchiness from Republicans now. At some point, someone has to break the cycle if were going to get anywhere as a country."
"Yes, the Democrats are hypocrites. But they were being disingenuous THEN. They knew that whatever they did, the limit would increase and life would go on. They figured they could score cheap points at the Republicans expense. But they did not actually put the economy at risk."
Thats funny. All the studies Ive seen show that democratic voters are less educated overall than republican voters.
"Maybe because historically democrats have the minority vote, who dont have the means to further tgeur education and dont go to schools as good as those of white majority districts. So theres that to factor"
"Still waiting for you to cite your imaginary sources... http://www.businessinsider.com/proof-republicans-really-are-dumber-than-democrats-2012-5 http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1 exit polls showing educated, higher earners overwhelmingly voted for Obama. http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/nov/05/larry-sabato/education-level-tied-voting-tendencies/ Sorry theyre all so wordy, I couldnt find any sources that were also picture books... "
Please link all the studies.
Actually historically the republican party is the one that fought to free slaves and bring about social equality. Abraham Lincoln was republican. 
Then explain why the supposedly better-educated party does not understand science. 
So what youre saying is that you havent seen any studies? Or that you have very specifically looked only for studies that showed what you wanted to see.
[Scientists are nine times more likely to be D than R](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/10/only-six-percent-of-scien_n_229382.html) The Republicans strongest educational demographic are college drop outs and those with associate degrees.

Huh? Mittens was 47th in job creation during his tenure. Not to mention he was the guy who was responsible for the health care plan that your side absolutely loathes. Being a good businessman (which really depends on how you define good businessman) does not translate to good president.
"He was a good enough businessman to trick Republicans into supporting him, even though he wasnt electable, and was responsible for the health care system that Republicans hate so much, and claimed hed be better for gay rights than Ted Kennedy.

It is turning insurance into a social safety net. This no longer insurance - its state welfare, but were still trying to run it via insurance companies. A stupid idea.

The CBO?s latest $1.76 trillion estimate (after passage) is for 11 years. Some Republican critics have claimed that the cost has doubled, while is is not technically accurate, the result is still the same...We were misled. http://www.factcheck.org/2012/03/health-care-costs-didnt-double/ http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/ http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-what-hed-said-was-you-could-keep/ So, yes, it IS easy to call this law worthless. *The law of the land* that Obama can lie about and change on a whim...

"How is it a disaster? Theres a lot of good from the aca already. No lifetime limits, no exclusion for pre existing conditions. It is turning insurance into a social safety net.

"Do you have a **source** for your claim about anyone that isnt a white male or poor is hated by the GOP or whatever the fuck you wrote?

Sad and pathetic when I see liberal minds like yours. You can vote and that is fucking scary shit. Its how we get Obama and fakes like him in office. **Low informed voters who think how they are told to by the liberal media.** Its just as easy for me to say you were brainwashed by a Marxist fraud bent on the dismantling of America as an economic power and will shred the Constitution at will to achieve that goal. My claim at least has some validity with factual evidence while yours seems like a typical low informed ignorant view, almost paranoid, that permeates Reddit. **AP press/FOX news free press attacks/IRS purposely targeting Conservative/Religious groups/The lies of Benghazi** Dear leader is not what you think he is.

"And Social Security is in dire need of money why? Tanners said and I quote, The Republicans have taken out Social Security funds and used them for pet projects, they have taken middle class taxes and given them to their business cronies and foreign governments, and have taken the voice of America by drawing illegal voting districts. **Social Security was moved from a private program to the general fund under his president Lyndon Johnson. Next his president Jimmy Carter started giving Social Security annuity payments to immigrants who never paid a dime into the system.** I started paying Social Security at age 12 in 1957 and put in over 50 years into a system that between Johnson and Carter is now going broke. **Please read the original FICA contract and follow it to today and see how many changes have made by the Democratic Party.** **As for pet projects, middle class taxes, business cronies, foreign governments, I think he has just given a very good definition of our current president.** [source](http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/opinions/letters/article/Blame-Democrats-not-Republicans-for-problems-730274.php) Then he went on about how Bush wanted to cut Social Security benefits. No, in the first place, **Bush wanted to privatize Social Security so that people earned more than the measly 1% or less that they currently earn on their investment in Social Security. No, the Democrats would have nothing to do with any idea that didnt involve government.** And adding to the retirement age? Well, people are living longer. When Social Security was first implemented, the average lifespan stopped at 65 years. So half the people never received any benefits from Social Security. Now the lifespan is around 80. Something must be done. People have to work longer or if they want to retire sooner, they have to save more privately. The math doesnt work otherwise. **He then says about Republicans, Their central goal is to hack away at government. Perhaps this is the only truth that Dionne stated in the article. Government is the root of most of our problems. We do need government but only to resolve conflicts of liberty between people, organizations and countries. Otherwise, it is the worst way to solve any societal problem. Its ability to solve poverty is a great example. Trillions later after the Great Society of the 1960s, and the percentage of poor has not changed. Think that might be human nature?** Dionne obviously thinks that stimulus helps renew an economy: Obama and Democrats in Congress enacted a substantial stimulus. The package should have been bigger, but Obama - thinking he would have another shot later at boosting the economy - kept its size down to win enough votes to get it through Congress. **Stimulus went to financial institutions, either directly or as bailouts to other industries in which financial institutions were the main beneficiary, or the unions in the case of GM. Remember the great profitability and the bonuses in the financial industry just a few months after the bailouts.** Few of those stimulus efforts ended up as helping production nor did they end up in the hands of consumers. Maybe a few jobs were created but mostly those jobs didnt produce things that people needed or wanted. [source](http://www.cavemannews.com/REPUBLICANSTheyreToBlameForEverything.htm)"
"Your sources are opinion pieces and devoid of fact. Lyndon Johnson did not raid Social Security, or change the way it operates, in any way. Jimmy Carter did not change anything about how social security operated as to whether or not you could get pay out without paying in. http://www.snopes.com/politics/socialsecurity/changes.asp As for what happened with the stimulus money... There is a lot of bullshit floating in that as well. There is no point addressing bald face lies and logical fallacies. When you have something to say for yourself, and not spread propaganda copy-pasta, you should return."
"Your comments are completely wrong and ignorant to the issue of Social Security. Do you even know anything about the issue that you dont read in **liberal news** sites? Educate yourself, better luck next time.. If you privatize Social Security, those funds that are used outside of government are not as readily available for the Governments general operating revenue. **The result is that Government will have to be more creative in conjuring up ways to increase taxes without getting the masses all riled up.** This can be done by reducing allowable deductions on mortgage interest and other deductions (charitable contributions, property taxes, limits on health care costs, etc.) or by increasing taxes or imposing taxes on items not generally taxed. **Bottom line, its a cash reserve or pot of money that Congress does not want to lose.**"
"&gt; We do need government but only to resolve conflicts of liberty between people, organizations and countries. And how does the modern Republican party purport to do that? The only conflicts the Republicans seem to solve are anti-poor and middle class and anti-anyone who isnt a white male."

"You mean when he referenced Charles Murray who said that some people are born lazy? I believe that argument is thoroughly discredited. There is a difference between name-dropping a few academics, and engaging with the academic argument. If he was doing the latter, he would need to acknowledge the large and persistent role that structural factors play in creating poverty. Quite a few of these academics are intellectual shills for their ideological presuppositions, mind you. If you want a second example of referring to the academic argument, look at the Regnerus fiasco."
"&gt;You mean when he referenced Charles Murray who said that some people are born lazy? I believe that argument is thoroughly discredited. Its true that Murray has made that argument, most notably in The Bell Curve. But thats not really a culture of poverty argument. I assume that what [Ryan is referring to](http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/03/13/paul_ryan_and_charles_murray.html) is Murrays more recent work, like Losing Ground and Coming Apart. Those books are much more closely tied to the culture of poverty literature. &gt;There is a difference between name-dropping a few academics, and engaging with the academic argument. Of course, but you have to remember that Ryan was doing an interview on talk radio, not giving a presentation at a poli sci conference. And the interviewer [specifically asked](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2014/mar/14/context-paul-ryans-poverty-comments-racial-attack/) Ryan to focus on the culture aspect instead of structural factors. (Bennett: Part of it is the economy, part of it is policy. But there?s a cultural aspect to this, as well, right?). I think a better reflection of Ryans views is the House Budget Committee [report](http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/war_on_poverty.pdf) that Ryan and Bennett were talking about (and that Ryans staff authored). It takes a more balanced approach, and acknowledges that Changes in family structure, changes in labor-market opportunities, and changes in broader demographics are a major part of why widespread poverty still exists. The report also talks quite a bit about the role that federal anti-poverty programs play, which I think would count as a structural factor. You may not agree with the conclusions Ryan draws -- and for what its worth, Im skeptical about a lot of them -- but I think its unfair to say Ryan was just repeating a racist dogwhistle. "

"So based on the article Obama did lie, but its OK because it was obvious to anyone who did research that it was a lie, and its also OK because politicians lie often?"
"I still dont see how this was a lie given whats actually happening. The law grandfathered every one of these peoples plan - as long as they didnt change. The insurance companies did not have to change these policies, since they were grandfathered. But, they did change those policies. Everyone could have kept their plan, but some have changed. What Obama said wasnt forthcoming, but neither is anything any politician says. Death panels anyone? Maybe Obama should have been crystal clear to people with junk policies If you like your plan, **and your insurance company never ever ever ever** changes it, you can keep it. But, it cant really be the same plan if it changes, so that wouldnt be the right thing to say."
"They can take my shitty health insurance plan when they pry it from my cold dead hands, which should not be too long from now considering the kind of coverage I have. "
"He should have mandated that the insurance companies can never cancel those plans..... No, wait, thatd be bad. "
"It wasnt a lie to anybody that can take a reasonable interpretation of his words. youll be able to keep your current healthcare should automatically in everyones minds come with the caveat as long as your insurer decides to keep offering it. If youre trying to say that Obama lied because not everybody could keep their current plans, then you have to admit that **not everybody could keep their plans even if there was no bill**. Insurance changes their plans. They discontinue some and keep others. They did that before the bill too. Yes, there might be a bit more of it now because of all sorts of shady shit the insurance companies are trying to pull... but thats it."
"There is some faux outrage, especially from conservatives who are claiming this is the issue they were warning about the whole time (it wasnt) and that no one would listen to them. But there is also some real outrage from people who got unexpected cancellation letters. Yes, some of them will get subsidies and some will get cheaper plans and all will get more comprehensive plans--but people legitimately hate unexpected burdens."
"Once youre enrolled in a qualifying plan in 2014, insurance companies will no longer be able to dump you if you become expensive. The real outrage is that this isnt what we are talking about. (And this was the original talking point, before it got twisted into the incorrect statement that Obama should never have repeated.)"
faux? this guy lives in a bubble.

"This is another piece of evidence for the claim that America and Americans are generally bipolar! If something is not absolutely 100% true, if there is only 1 in a population who could not keep their insurance, the wolves would be screaming Liar! Every sane human being understand what he said. Most and by most, the vast majority, would keep their plans. You will always find outliers who have some insane plans that can no longer be used and as such can not keep their plans. What Obama said is basically true, except for a small minority but the bipolar Americans now call it the worst lie ever. Watching US politics is like watching a discussion at the local mental asylum!"
[The 36 Times Obama Said You Could Keep Your Health Care Plan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpa-5JdCnmo) Nixon resigned over a way smaller lie than this one.
"Well, I suppose that he figured that people who would be getting booted off their insurance because it doesnt meet their needs would not be liking it, he would be correct. Remember - politicians rarely *outright* lie. They just bend the truth or say something in such a way that it can be perceived in a way that they didnt actually say thing. So if Obamas justification was that nobody should be happy with a plan that basically doesnt take care of you and you pay a bunch of premiums to, only to find out that when you need care you dont get cared for. So, those people are not part of the If you like your insurance crowd. Unfortunately, what it doesnt account for is various employers seeking to find a way to make sure that they make a liar out of him or find the cheapest way in which to pay their employees while also allowing the government to pick up the slack. This was a miscalculation on his part. This is *not* on the same caliber of other lies, such as saying that there are death panels, that there are weapons of mass destruction, or any number of significant lies within the last decade. Death panels were justified in being talked about because they spun the ability to judge what is and isnt covered as death panels (they conveniently left out that insurance companies do the same). The issue is, however, that theyre not deciding who lives and dies, theyre deciding care. They were also using living will directives as part of this, and that is basically the discussion with your doctor about end of life care. It does not encourage you to die - it simply encourages you to tell them what you want them to try and do to keep you alive, its your choice. Combining the two lead to death panels, which is still better than the weapons of mass destruction statement. The weapons of mass destruction statement was often quoted, and spoke on, as We know they have them, *we gave them to him*. Remember - we fought against Iran using Iraq and the reason Saddam existed in the first place *was because of US interference in the area*. So while not an outright lie, the idea of a mushroom cloud somewhere was very, very far fetched. Understand, though, that politicians find a way to be right. I recall a moment with me and my wife where I had that same streak of ingenuity. When questioning why I was picking out something that I previously didnt like to wear, she said it must be because Im right, because it does look good. I responded, I was not wrong - its still ugly. I was simply right, I can make anything look good. Politics is about choosing what to say, when to say it, how to say it and making sure that what youre saying is covered at some level in order to save your ass by walking it back. Politicians rarely *outright* lie, but theyll mislead and misdirect whenever possible."
"Well, at least the Guardian has acknowledged it *was*, indeed, a lie. Good start, Guardian."
This lie cost people money and loss of insurance plans. It isnt faux.
"&gt;It has never been a secret that there would be Americans whose coverage would change under the ACA, that some would face higher prices or, as they correctly surmise, better coverage is in the lead of the Washington Post story about the bills passage. Im a 23 year old male, and I now have to pay for maternity coverage. In no way am I *better* covered for anything more than I was before, and Im going to be paying out the ass. Im sorry, but **more** coverage doesnt mean **better** coverage. Oh yea, and I make a little bit too much money to qualify for any subsidies. Fantastic, because I worked my ass off and graduated in the top 5% of my class with an engineering degree, I now get to pay for everyone elses shit. I hope some kind of medical miracle or divine intervention happens, and I get pregnant. At least then Ill get some use out of this. Higher premiums, higher deductible means more out of pocket cost, all for provisions that I dont want or need. I was fine with my plan before. "
Whether you support obamacare or not.... Obama knowingly lied numerous times during the selling of obamacare. 
I think people are actually pissed about this... they thought they could keep their healthcare and now they cant and have to pay more. That would piss me off...
He did lie Period.
Its not Faux outrage. He was dishonest in his selling of the bill. Why is anyone surprised a politician lies to his constituency? This was a long-standing Democrat agenda item. He wasnt going to let something silly like the truth get in his way. We have to pass this Bill to find out whats in it. It sums things up pretty well. 
I like how the media gets to tell us whether our feelings are real or phony.

"What he said was, If you like your plan, you can keep it. What he meant was, If you like your plan, you can keep it - unless, of course, you have a bare-bones, catastrophic plan that actually doesnt cover much, but you like because its fairly cheap and youve never had to actually use it. In that case, youll have to buy a more expensive plan that meets the minimum standards of coverage outlined in the ACA. What he perhaps could have said was, If you like your plan, you can keep it so long as it meets minimum standards. This is not merely a distinction without a difference. Some people are going to be pissed about this."
Stop complaining about another broken promise!!!
"I dont think its faux outrage; it seems real. Thats a fine piece, she raises fine points, but this idea that Conservatives are just faking their views for the sake of being difficult is a stale, old chestnut...they really *are* as dumb as they seem."
"If it isnt a lie, then what is it?"
"This is yet another attempt to whitewash discontent. Remember folks, nothing wrong with the ACA is the administrations fault, and if you dont like being lied to, the terrorists win. "
"If the act was going to kick some people out of their plan he should have said that, instead he said You will be able to keep your plan and then went on a cross country tour bashing republicans for calling him out on it. No its not the biggest lie told in his Presidency, he never closed Guantanamo,but damn he still hasnt apologized."
"its all about the message they are sending about the ACA. on NPR this morning, i heard about the security issues of one man, whose personal information was accidentally sent to another man. however, on reddit i was linked to a local news story of a woman whose health insurance premiums for her type 2 diabetes went from $509/month to $1.11/month. "
"Yes, a lot of people are being dumped from their current plans. As has happened en masse every year for decades. And because of ACA, starting in 2014, this will never happen again because insurers will no longer be allowed to dump their customers."
Nothing fake about my outrage.
Read my lips
"Desperate to carry that Obama Water, pig liberals continue to mentally contort to a grotesque degree. Funny how every little thing under Bush was black and white, but under the messiah magically everything is up to interpretation. "

Faux outrage? Me shelling out another $2500/yr for my policy and losing coverage on my spouse is NOT faux outrage you smug fuck. 
Flat out liar trying to blame insurance companies for smart business decisions. ACA doesnt make sense. Stop dicking around and go to either single-payer or total free market. This middle of the road bs isnt doing anyone any favors.
"Calling something a lie because it isnt 100% true for 100% of people is weak bullshit, and its done by people looking to jump on Obama for any little thing. You call something a lie because its straight up bullshit. Let me give you two examples. You can keep your health insurance policy if you like it. Iraq has WMDs, funded the 9/11 attacks, and is a threat to us. Now, which of those two do you think is straight up bullshit? edit: Wow, people trying to defend Bush and the Iraq war. Un-fucking-believable! Well, at least we know that r/politics isnt the liberal circlejerk that people always whine about."
"Campaign promises almost have to be discounted as being a lie simply due to the candidate not necessarily having all the information necessary to make such a promise. Not being privy to classified information or not knowing the complete scope of a particular promise can affect the ability to deliver on the promise. That being said, I dont approve of just never addressing it. I would love to see someone ask him why he hadnt closed it and if he is sorry for promising something he couldnt deliver on. The you will be able to keep your plan is just taken as an absolute definitive statement. Had he said 94% of the people currently insured can keep their plan as it is, then there isnt any untruth to it. If someone says dogs have four legs, is it a lie? Obviously not all dogs have four legs but it doesnt mean that the person is intending to mislead by making the statement. "
"I dont think the statements he made are lie. They were an over-simplification. His statement is true for 95% of people. There happens to be a small number of people who cant keep their plan because the plan they had covered so little, that it can barely be called health insurance. So they have to get a real health insurance plan, in many cases, with the costs covered. The law pertains to millions of people, and yes simplifying that law into a soundbite leads to some mistakes. This, to me, is different than lying."
"Yes, this lie is not a big deal. Yes, we should still hold our politicians to a higher standard."
"He didnt lie. He just misspoke a mistruth. And who cares anyway? He did what needed to be done. The idiot Teatards who are complaining should sit down, shut up and know their place. They should be grateful that they are now receiving a plan much better than whatever crappy insurance they had. They also should be honored by the privilege that it is to pay more for their plan because its good for their president and their country."
One of the few things we still manufacture in this country is outrage. Only in a country where FoxNews is popular would people be angry theyre losing insurance policies that provide them with no coverage.
"It should have been obvious to everyone that every insurance company everywhere would cancel any insurance policy that costs less than the minimum Bronze plan. It would be foolish for them to do anything else. Why would they continue to sell a cheaper plan when they could cancel it and force people to buy more expensive ones that they probably wont use any more of than their older plans? The you can keep your existing plan was always a pipe dream, and everyone should have known it."
It is crazy how fast politicians can change the subject on a national scale. I swear at this point everyone has forgotten about the government shutdown. I even feel like it was ages ago.
B... bu... but the talking points. THINK OF THE TALKING POINTS!

"Theres been a lot of false outrage directed toward Democratic actions and policies, but thats actually not the case here. People were assured by the president himself that they could rest easy knowing that they would still be allowed to keep their current plans if they so desired. That turned out to be an outright lie and people have a right to be pissed off about it. And why does everyone like to overuse the word faux? "
And this is how a (R)etard might win again. Because insurance companies played fools for fools.
"I guess Obama should have prefaced his statement with the qualifier: *Unless your current healthcare plan is a scam*, you can keep it. "
"Yes, the Obama team knew that some people wouldnt be able to keep their insurance. So did any reporter who did her research. Funny how the reporters never seemed to mention that during the last presidential elections. Besides, everyone (besides liberals) knows that ObamaCare was never about the uninsured or better coverage. It has always been about being one step closer to socialized medicine. Which will collapse just like its doing now in [Venezuela](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/V/VENEZUELA_SICK_HEALTH_CARE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2013-11-06-00-10-00). "
"Herp Derp, president lied NBD GUIS!"
*FOX
"where is the outrage over the hundreds, literally hundreds, of lies that were told by foxnews, tea baggers and other right wingnuts about the ACA???"
"True. Lets just stick to the real outrage, about the real lies, and keep the faux out of it."
I dont see Republicans crying for the millions they kicked off their insurance by not expanding Medicare. 
"Faux outrage? Its not that I specifically am angered about the Obamacare lie, but Im sick of the lies in general. The outrage is real."
Fake outrage is all republicans have. 
so the big complaint is that the government didnt take over healthcare????
"Its my personal hope that insurance companies will dig a hole so deep and so unpleasant for themselves, that we end up with single-payer universal healthcare. For decades, theyve screwed people over, exploited loopholes, and generally been the picture of bad business practice. They deserve to greed themselves into extinction."
"Faux outrage? - For Americans who dont qualify for subsidies, Ive yet to hear of a single case in which the affordable healthcare act will result in premiums more affordable than before. If your healthcare is costing you more after the passing of this legislation, you have a bloody good right to be outraged. "
"If you think only bad plans have been discounted you are a credulous fool. If you think it is ok for a President of the United States to get up in front of the country and LIE in order to get his agenda passed, you are dangerous idiot. "
"The whole idea of health insurance is a fucking scam and a lie, yet you put up with the insurance companies shit. "
"&gt; Also, isnt Harry Reid trying to buy this land and that is realistically why this story has been going viral? Source? With evidence?"
"Well, to be fair: when Bank of America or General Electric *do* have to pay a tax, they dont round up an army of gunmen to drive away the tax collectors. Thats kind of an important difference."
"[No.](http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/nevada.asp) Whatever whackadoodle website or news channel told you that, stop using it. Youre being lied to."
Are you forgetting what they did during OWS?
"I guess its just so funny to me how this story about a moocher cowboy is going viral. Especially when you take into account the massive amount of corporate welfare queens we have or even the trillions hidden away in off-shore bank accounts. Seriously, get mad at the right people please... Let the liberal downvotes begin. Also, isnt Harry Reid trying to buy this land and that is realistically why this story has been going viral?"
Obama would kick Boehners ass at poker.
"He wants a conversation with the President for negotiation purposes. This is the list of things he wants: 1. Cuts to Medicare. 2. Cuts to social security. 3. Cuts to Obamacare. 4. Cuts to a large number of other social programs. Heres the list of things he is willing to give up: 1. Nothing. This is not a negotiation. He doesnt want to have a conversation, he wants to dictate terms. For a negotiation to take place there needs to be a certain amount of give and take. All I see is a list of demands. Do as I say or Ill burn down your house is not a negotiation tactic - its a threat. "
"What he says now constantly contradicts what he said before, his credibility is lost completely. "
That lying prick cocksucker spends 13 minutes &amp; 59 seconds repeating the [same lie](http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/19-times-democrats-tried-to-negotiate-with-republicans-20131007) over &amp; over again. All politicians are lying scumbags but this piece of shit really takes the cake. 
"If I walk into a bank put a gun to a womans head and demand that the president repeal the prohibition to marijuana in 2 hours or I kill her is it then the presidents fault when I blow her brains out because he refused to have a conversation. This man and the people he supports are committing what amounts to treason. They are subverting the law of this country and using criminal tactics to get by a law that was passed by every known check and balance that we have INCLUDING the people of the United States. He says that the people dont want this law yet it was the peoples duly elected Congress and President that signed it into law. It was our Supreme Court that found it to be Constitutional and it was those very people who ratified it by electing this president to a second term. What he means to say is that its HIS people who dont want this law and he and they will do whatever they can to force the President to subvert the will of the people to do his bidding. This man is a traitor and he should be tried as one. They need to learn that in a democracy majority rules, even if you disagree with them."
"I dont blame Boehner for his stance, from his perspective he has no choice but to play chicken, since the Tea Party controls the Republican party in 2013. But, I have a couple of things to say to any fiscal conservative who thinks Obamacare is too expensive: 1. Ronald Reagan. If you dont know what I mean by that, just Google what Ron Paul thinks of spending in Reagan years. 2. Iraq War. Enough said. Every Republican complaining about costly health care should have complained about the lives and financial costs of Iraq, not to mention the benefits not being paid to veterans these conservatives claim to honor. 3. Tax Cuts. Pretty simple math, doesnt help government revenue when you cut taxes. 4. Big government programs like Department of Homeland Security and Bushs prescription drug program or laws like the Patriot Act. Yes, we might need them in this day and age, but they add to the size of government and were started under Republicans. So much for limited government principles causing a shutdown. 5. Republicans love to raise the Debt Ceiling when theyre in office: More specifically, it lists 18 increases to the debt ceiling between February 1981 and September 1987. In other words, there were 18 under President Ronald Reagan, as Obama said. And there were seven increases between January 2001 and January 2009 -- during George W. Bushs presidency. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/26/barack-obama/obama-says-reagan-raised-debt-ceiling-18-times-geo/ So, although Republicans today love to evoke limited government principles, in reality they pick and chose when to actually abide by these ideals. When in office, they do as they please, but when a Democrats in the White House, then government needs to stop spending. "
"Not enough votes, just trust him, dont actually, you know, have a vote or anything, we can trust him instead. Maybe also have a conversation, because clearly thats the going talking point. I dont think I can trust someone who clearly cannot answer a straightforward question. "
[Heres the youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8GuMRxk5TU)
Who the fuck does he think hes speaking for every time he says the American people? I nor anyone I know recall asking for any of the bullshit hes pulled off.
"Boehner: All we want is to have a conversation with Obama. He just needs to pick up the phone and give me a call and we could end this thing today. But he simply refuses to negotiate with us, and so were forced into this situation. Stephanopoulos: So if he did call you, would you be willing to discuss a clean CR that doesnt include changes to ObamaCare? Boehner: ABSOLUTELY NOT! NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS! WE WILL NEVER PASS A CLEAN CR NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!!! All were asking is that Obama negotiate with us. Thats all. Yet he continues to refuse to do so. Just call so we can have a real conversation about this, Obama. Thats all were asking. Stephanopolous: How about the debt limit? If Obama were to accept several billion dollars in cuts in exchange for new revenue, would you... Boehner: ABSOLUTELY NOT! UNDER NO POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD WE EVER EVEN CONSIDER SUCH A THING! TAX REVENUES ARE ENTIRELY OFF LIMITS AND SOMETHING THAT WILL NEVER EVER HAPPEN! EVER!!! Now if Obama would just call me so that we could have a conversation we could do something about this, but he simply refuses to negotiate on anything. It is his refusal to negotiate that keeps pushing us closer and closer to the brink of collapse. Stephanopoulos: But.... Boehner: ABSOLUTELY NOT! WE WILL NEVER EVER DO THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!! Now if only Obama were willing to negotiate."
"What a deceptive person John Boehner is. HE is the one holding the gun, yet he wants to convince us that it would be someone elses fault if he chooses to use it. I recall hearing that sort of rhetoric used before, when terrorists take hostages and warn them against heroics. John Boehner is responsible, as in the one who is able, to initiate a vote an a *clean* continuing resolution. He doesnt want a *clean* CR, he wants a CR with provisions to attack an existing law he cannot directly defund, a law that was even challenged and upheld by the Supreme Court. He lies by saying that the votes for a clean CR do not exist. When he is confronted with that fact, he ignores it and reasserts his deceptive rhetoric about having a conversation. Does anyone else remember the extensive conversation we had when the Affordable Care Act was going through congress? John Boehner hopes that we, the American people, dont. John Boehner hopes that we, the American people, wont count the votes available for a clean CR. Maybe John and his party hope that we, the American people, forget that they shut down the government, caused it default, and thus damaged the economy, so that later they can blame the economic malaise on Obamacare and Democratic policies in an attempt to regain more power in government. The real question is, are we, the American people, gullible enough to fall for these deceptions?"
The Right will have a lot of explaining to do when they lose the White House to a Women in 2016.
"That was a poorly conducted interview. I get that Stephanouplous was trying get Boehner to essentially admit that he was bluffing, but he completely let Boehner go on the numerous attempts Democrats had made to negotiate and go to conference on the budget. And, he completely let Boehner off the hook by not calling out the fact that the House proposals to the Senate started off with the complete non-starter of defunding the ACA about 24 hours before the govt shutdown."
http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/06/john-boehner-loses-melts-caught-debt-ceiling-lies.html John Boehner Loses It When Hes Caught In Several Shutdown and Debt Ceiling Lies 
"Serious question, would this be considered as treason? I think that its a pretty brazen attempt to overthrow (see: circumvent) the government to push personal agenda."
"I want a conversation, I want a conversation, I want a conversation. How many times did that asshat repeat that same phrase. He is a drunken and incompetent fool who has clearly lost control. He refuses to schedule a vote he says because the votes are not there but he held 42 separate votes on defunding the Affordable Health Care act knowing that he did not have the votes. What a world class liar. "
"When Boehner was asked what he was willing to put on the table for this serious conversation of which he is so fond, he listed a bunch of things he wants from the Democrats. Now Im no congressman, but that doesnt sound like a negotiation to me."
He can feel the end of his career coming and it is getting to him. If he allows the government to receive funding the tea party will make sure he is never elected to any position again and with the extremists in the party I would suspect his life could be in danger. Many of them really believe this shut down will bring people to their side. If he doesnt fund the government for longer democrats will be flooding in money to make sure his district is full of attack ads and working as hard as they can to make any future campaign he tries a living hell.
"Say conversation again. Say conversation again, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker, say conversation one more Goddamn time!"
"I guess the keyword of the day is conversation, mentioned 14 times - once per minute."
This guy is unbelievable. I think he actually believes some of the shit hes saying.
"If the votes arent there, then whats the problem? The dems want the vote, and if they lost the vote it would make Boehner look good. Hed love to see a failing vote, yet hes claiming that there arent enough votes and wont do it. Its an interesting time in politics, watching a drawn out political suicide in action. The question is really how badly this will hurt the GOP controlled house in 2014. If the GOP is stupid enough to let the US default on its loans theyll be fucking gone from the political scene. Loans across the country will go up, social security checks will cease, military personnel in the field wont get paid. And a ton of other huge problems will arise. If that happens, watch the American public replace large amounts of the GOP. I almost want them to do it just so I can see them get owned. ...Almost."
"Everytime you hear the phrase have a conversation, drink."
The amount of projection coming from that man is unreal.
How many times did he use the word conversation or sit down and have a conversation. Did they not have one before before the damn thing got passed? They lost. Get over it. This is coming from a Right leaning independent.
Lying piece of shit. 
say have a conversation one more time..... say it one more goddamn time..
"Conversation, conversation, American people.... Freaking broken record."
"I didnt see him lose it in that video. If anything, he looked like he was being desperately careful, almost like someone was holding a gun to his back and ready to shoot if he strayed from the talking points."
"How many times did he say sit down and have a conversation? Seriously, they are programmed to say bullshit like this, they are robots. So if we kill them, we shouldnt feel too bad."
"can somebody count how many times he says have a conversation... I cant believe that he (they) cant be arrested for impeding government, when I can be arrested for taking a shopping cart out of the mall. We dont negotiate with terrorists. "
Fucking terrorist.
John Boehner is a piece of shit.
How are you supposed to pronounce boehner? To me it looks like it should be close to boner
"Ugh, the problem is George never really calls him out on his lies. The average person watching this would probably assume he is a reasonable guy who just wants to talk. He is never called out on the fact that the GOP refused to negotiate on a budget for most of the year, that every other time a president negotiated during these crises it was never about undoing a law that the other side didnt like, or that the GOP has been planning this shutdown as a way to get their way on an issue that theyve lost on. George just keeps asking him the same question over and over and basically lets him appear to be the reasonable guy just waiting for the President to talk."
"Can we talk about [this fairness meme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8GuMRxk5TU&amp;t=54s)? As I understand it, the argument is that we should be fair and allow citizens the same year-long exemption from the ACA that businesses have. However, I feel that this is 1. like comparing apples to oranges (a person buying health insurance for themselves isnt the same as a business paying for health insurance for its employees) and 2. a farce because Im presupposing (and please correct me if Im wrong) that the exception for businesses was a concession to get the ACA implemented."
Never seen a more dedicated group of people? They take how many days off each year? I can go 500 feet and talk to people who work more days and just as many hours. 
"you know i wish the president wasnt such a tool. when boehner starts whining about the spending i think boy it would be sooooo fucking awesome if the president grew a pair of balls and sent boehner a budget taht slashes the military spending of the country in half. he wants to demand 150 billion in cuts? fine cut military discretionary spending by half, boom 300 billion gone. then he can go to the media and say hey boehner wants 150 billion i gave him 300 billion in cuts, he still says no. take it to the people. lets see how many people want to keep paying for afghanistan or iraq or any of the military spending. shit you could cut those 300 billion and STILL have a bigger military budget then the next 3 biggest military spenders."
Did anyone else see that little smirk when George said to him You are the man! You are the one man in Washington who has the power to reopen the government. Hes so fucking happy and proud that the entire world is begging for his mercy. What a damn sociopath.
"Just dont forget who it was that wanted to the government to [cater to the rich and the corporations](http://thecontributor.com/how-redistribution-rich-has-broken-back-america), then shut down the entire government because they didnt want you to get healthcare..."
"Waiting for Obama to say, I will not negotiate with terrorists. That would make my week. "
So sick of this dudes bullshit rhetoric about a fair conversation. Weve had the damn conversation and it didnt go the way Republicans wanted. Tough titty said the kitty. Let the experiment go forward. Im already signed up for healthcare starting in January. Kinda excited about being able to see a doctor. 
Has he started running away from reporters yet?
"Jesus, this guy really wants to have a conversation with somebody. Fuck."
He needs to lay off the booze.
I will never not pronounce his name any other way than Boner
can we have a conversation about a conversation we had years ago about that specific conversation?
"He exhibits the classic speech patterns of someone who is out of his depth and on very shaky ground. He keeps repeating the same moronic and meaningless phrases and changes the subject every time an even slightly difficulty topic is raised. Basically, he is incapable of answering a straight question and uses absurd soundbites to respond rather than giving a straight answer. I found it hugely maddening to watch him to the point where I couldnt take it any more. The reality is this pondlife is hellbent on destroying the American economy and possibly the world economy too."
"This interview was terrible. They just said the same canned phrases over and over, both of them."
WHAT. A. FUCKING. SCUMBAG.
"Im against John Boehner as much as the next guy, but John Boehner Loses It is more than just a bit of dirty media at play. The source is super liberal, which is fine. But Boehner, I thought, actually kept his cool and answered the questions in a calm and collected manner. He lied a couple times, and some of his facts were obviously wrong, but he didnt freak out and lose it. He rarely even changed in demeanor. I know /r/Politics is generally anti-Republican, as am I, but each side is exaggerating issues to make each other look bad. Also, Im 6 minutes in and hes said conversation or sit down and have a conversation 8 times. Its one of the more obvious political tactics. You have a key phrase you want the viewers to remember. In this case, Boehner wants people to remember that the Democrats are refusing to have a conversation. Notice he never said lets sit down and talk. Its an old media brainwashing technique. Thats his only goal with this entire interview. Btw, just in typing this paragraph hes already up to 12. EDIT: FINAL COUNT - 20"
I didnt see a man get mad. I saw a very stubborn man repeat the same talking points over and over again
"This once powerful leader is more and more resembling a ventriloquists dummy with the hand of the Tea Party shoved up his ass. I wonder if he really thinks that intelligent, knowledgeable people cant see completely through him? Stephanopolos obviously does. All I can think is that Koch Brothers money has come to mean more to him than his country."
"My favorite part was when he blamed governments of the last 30 years for the problems he sees today, while ignoring the fact that hes been part of the federal government for 22 of those years. "
The fact that people like this are allowed into a position where they can hold our country hostage from within disgusts me.
"Rich people have rich kids, rich families, nice houses. They are comfortable. Whether the government is shut down or not. Thats why these Republicans dont care. They pretend to care because they need humans to vote. They dont care. They are chilling, relaxing. This shut down does not affect their childrens wellbeing. They dont care about yours. "
"EXCELLENT COMMENT from the link, and I wish someone would call him on it on camera. *The Speaker allows time, energy and money on votes against the Affordable Care Act 42 times on any given day knowing he doesn?t have the votes, yet can?t quite seem to bring a vote to the floor to keep the nation running and not taking the economy further because he says we need to trust him that no one would vote for it. .*"
"A few things I noticed here: He uses the word Fairness a lot. Is it fair to put hundreds of thousands of people out of work (who are responsible for doing a number of jobs that help keep Americans safe - i.e. Food Inspectors) Best interest of the American People was also something he said. Is it in our best interest to not have the people I mentioned above at work? Is it in our best interest to threaten our countrys first default, likely resulting in huge economic impact? Spiking interest rates where people cannot afford to pay back student loans/mortgages etc? He accused the Harry Ried of adopting a My Way or the Highway mentality. Is it really a My way or the highway mentality when the ones trying to be somewhat reasonable (and I use that loosely because most of those in Congress are idiots) refuse to give in to extortion in order to get a particular result? Is it my way or the highway because the House Republicans refuse to pass a clean spending bill because they are so opposed to a law that nobody wants, even though the country has shown that is not the case (even if it does need some changes). Is it my way or the highway to do all of this because a few are butthurt about ACA? How can you pass a clean bill without addressing the underlying issues - What exactly is the underlying issue hes referring to here. Because it appears as though the major hang up is the ACA - Which has been in effect for about a week. Squandering the future of our kids - really??? Shutting down the government so the kids of those who are being furloughed arent being adversely impacted? Because threatening to cause a default if we dont succumb to the extremists extortion attempts, which could have huge impacts on the ability of our kids to get loans to go to school, or to pay them back, or to get a loan to buy a car, or a mortgage, etc. isnt squandering their future? And most amazingly to me, we dont have enough votes to pass it. Then let there be a vote for crying out loud! If youre so certain, then allowing a vote would only help you in that it would prove that youre right. Let there be a vote, and at least give these people a chance to go back to work! Its just more finger pointing at the other guys. At this point, it doesnt matter whos responsible (even though its pretty apparent that its Boehners guys). What matters is that our country is f**ked if they dont do something fast, and not to mention that we are becoming a laughing stock around the world for this. Ive never seen such a lack of logic, intelligence, compromise, sympathy, or leadership in my life. It truly is disgusting. "
Do you think hell cry?
"How can we pass a clean debt limit while ignoring the underlying problem?... We have taken in less than weve spent for 55 of the last 60 years... Paraphrased a bit, but hes saying to solve this problem we need to give individuals a waiver that would exempt them from having to pay a fine (tax) if they dont buy insurance? Less revenue = fixing the deficit. Republican math."
"If he says conversation one more time, Im gonna punch him in the dick."
Boehner is a terrorist. He and the GOP have become existential threats to my country. Fuck this shit. Under a Westminster system all of congress would have been automatically terminated last week.
Republicans: Under no circumstances will we compromise. We expect YOU to compromise. By compromise we mean we expect you to give us what we want. Or else.
God damn if I hear the phrase sit down and have a conversation one more time Im gonna vomit.
When he says The American people dont want this (In regards to the affordable care act) What does that mean? What does he base that statement on? Did they do polls? Im not even american and Iv seen some polls... Dont more people want it?
I dont follow this AT ALL! What are the 3 lies in the transcript?
[deleted]
Check please
Wwhere r are the crazy ppl with guns when you need them!
Would be funny if it wasnt so sad.
"At what point did Boehner lose it? Im not a Republican by any stretch, but these bullshit sensationalist titles to try to get karma are so disingenuous. Downvoted."
BONER
I think we need a Boehner conversation count on the bottom of the video
I must have missed the big melt down. Or wait... Is this what they call sensationalistic journalism? Too funny...you guys thought I was a Republican didnt you. Nope....No way...And still dont see it.
John sit down and have a conversation Boehner
"If he were right, would it do any harm (to the Republicans) to have the vote? "
"I never thought Id say it but Boehner has a point. The government is writing checks for toys (aircraft that dont perform as advertised, NSA, endless wars, etc.) that it cant afford. Whats wrong with expecting the President to be fiscally prudent? Can someone give me a serious answer? All this party bashing doesnt float as a serious answer anymore. "
Hes willing to shut the government down and possibly cause a crisis that would cause Americans and their families all sorts of money ...to try to keep them from paying too much on insurance premiums. edit - grammr
The democrats are being little kids putting there fingers in their ears going lalala
Hes kind of the the guy who says She made me rape her by dressing in those tight shorts...
Here is the whole video on a a few sentences: John: I hate Obama Care it will devastate the healthcare business and that is why we have shut down the government. In every question asked about the government shutdown he just would answer blah blah blah Obama Care blah blah blah
"Loses it? I just watched the whole thing, seems he seems cool as a cucumber (a cucumber who has developed a radio personality voice). Im no supporter of this man, but lets call a spade a spade: he was pretty collected and on-point through this whole interview."
I hope that when this country sinks that some of the imbeciles who have supported this thug and his lackeys will finally acknowledge that republicans have had the goal of destroying this nation for the past 10 years and then some. Shame on those who have been fooled into supporting those tea party members and other poli-terrorists in the House. What an embarrassment to the entire legacy and history of this nation. Cant wait until the ship of fools that is the GOP/Tea Party express sinks to the bottom of the abyss. 
LOL @ Loses It
So what actually happens if the United States defaults on its debt?
"Seriously people... this is such worthless nonsense. I agree Boehner is pathetic and laughably dishonest, but he didnt lose it - the title is misleading (it is the actual article title though). And the interview was ridiculous. The guy doing the interview was embarrassingly afraid to call Boehner on his absurd bullshit. It doesnt deserve any attention, nor does Politicsusa for trying make it even marginally interesting by adding a bullshit title."
"where is the part where he loses it, or am i interrupting the circlejerk?"
"I always wonder why nobody expose these liars on live television when they?re claiming the Democrats refuse to have a conversation about this. They tried that 19 times, but the GOP refused. So why is Boehner not confronted with this bullshit and is allowed to repeat his lies over and over again?"
"Boehner forgets whos really responsible for the overspending with his political reversals. It appears the Republican party is fully aware of the power of a government shutdown as a political negotiation weapon, as Boehner acknowledges himself, and states in no uncertain terms hes willing to give up nothing while blatantly LYING about what he cares about most. Its not averting default, instead he argues this logical fallacy about keeping to his principle about financial judiciousness while making NO concessions to raise taxes. Seriously, the guy is full of rehearsed political wharrgarbl. He doesnt seem capable of rational argument."
Its okay for him though because people dont really care.
Oh? Did Americas avatar for used car salesmen finally have a feeling?
"This man is a complete sociopath. We need to make an example of him, and hold him for treason. More so than any other person held for treason in my lifetime (Im 30), I think this man deserves that accusation. He is possibly KILLING hundreds, if not thousands of people, because of his direct (and indirect) actions. If we do nothing to this man, politicians will continue to run this country into the ground. "
"Honestly, Im pretty sure this is the end of John Boehners political career, or at the very least of his career as a major political player. He committed himself too fully to this tactic, and now that its going down in flames theres no way out. His party wont have any choice but to throw him under the bus and try to pretend it was entirely his fault."
"fine, have the conversation. obama vs bohner, televised live in front of a studio audience."
"Okay, I know what the expression loses it means in this context. But I cant help wondering what Boehner actually has that he could lose. Certainly not influence, respect, intelligence, or honesty."
After watching this video I really think we should sit down and have a conversation. 
Wow. He cant even answer a direct yes or no conversation with the words yes or no anywhere in his answer.
He definitely doesnt lose it. 
"Oh lord, were going to default arent we?"
He says conversations 36 times. You know its just bullshit rhetoric when they just hover on one word. 
"So is he saying that you always have the right to keep debating indefinitely while holding progress hostage, even though youve already lost the debate?"
tl;dw: Sit down and have a conversation *100.
Truly scary. This guy sounds like a desperate madman. And he is one of the most powerful people in one of the most powerful governments in the world.
Bohner keep fighting the good fight my dude
"As far as Im concerned, thats not losing it on TV, this conversation was actually more civilized than any politic discussion in Austria ever. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kLK69zmPGM&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player"
someone should Indefinitely detain him for supporting al qaeda by creating a situation where the government is shut down. under AUMF 2001 and NDAA 2012 
Seriously? You guys can see everything. 
"What i dont understand is why, in the 5 years since we last raised the debt ceiling, does it come down to just before the new ceiling is met that we start to work on the problem? I know there are other issues to deal with on a day to day basis but if these people really had the best interest of american citizens at heart i cant believe that they would be so irresponsible as to wait till a couple days before catastrophy. Its just a game for these people, and everyone involved believes its the game that should change for them and not the other way around."
If we played a drinking game where we took a shot every time he said the word conversation we would all win.
I suddenly have a hankering for some good conversation.
"lose it... had himself and angry little meltdown lost his temper Ok, all of that is pretty damn hyperbolic. He never came close to losing his temper. He was definitely visibly agitated at multiple points during the interview, but if the person who wrote this article thinks it was a meltdown, then I am wondering how many meltdowns he must witness in just a normal day. Poor guy - must suck to be him But seriously, I am pretty sure I lost my temper way more than Boehner did just by listening to the bullshit that he was spewing to George. What a frustrating interview. Im a reasonable guy my ass."
Boehner is a lying sack of shit.
"Too bad george didnt point out how happy the gop is they shut down the government. people arent stupid, they see what the gop did and they wont forget or I hope the Democrats wont let them forget. This is so much like all the tv and movies plots where the bad guy injures or kills a hostage and then blames the good guy. Its your fault I had to kill your family, you just wouldnt listen!."
"Can someone please ELI5 who John Bohner is and what the background to this story Is? Im not from America, so Im not sure, but Im still intrested by politics in the US."
The only thing he should be losing is his job... maybe citizenship. 
"So, whats the deal here? If hes a liar and incompetent, how come he cant get fired?"
"These isolated interviews are too easy for politicians to double-talk and use vague and misleading language to portray themselves as in-the-right If Obama and Boehner were interviewed side-by-side, they could call each other out directly, and at least then we would know that someone was blatantly lying, because its too easy for someone to say whatever they want about someone when that other person isnt there to counter their talking points."
Good video. But spent 13 minutes waiting for him to lose it and.......it never happened.
He didnt lose it. Sensational headline is sensational.
"All he wants is a conversation? So, as soon as there is a conversation hell bring it to a vote? Thats easy enough. Somebody go talk to this man so we can end all this. He never said he wants to *do* anything, just have a conversation."
"It?s one thing to disagree with what should be funded based on ideology, morals or even your personal opinion it?s entirely another thing to lie about it. John Boehner is either delusional incompetent or compulsive liar I wonder which it is."
We should make a drinking game - take a shot at every mention of ObamaCare. Its like hes getting paid for every mention.
"Can someone help me out here, how is he still in a position of power? Is this one man shutting down the country? I would be impressed he wields such power if it wasnt so crushingly sad."
"This will probably get lost, but I encourage everyone to contact Speaker John Boehner (in addition to your Congressional representatives) and exercise your political voice. [You can fill out the contact form here.](http://www.speaker.gov/contact) This is my letter to the Speaker. It is a collage of some excellent and well-written comments from you all, interspersed with my own thoughts. Feel free to copy if you agree (or write your own if you dont agree) and are feeling lazy or just dont have a lot of spare time: *Speaker John Boehner, You want a conversation with the President for negotiation purposes. This is the list of things you want: 1. Cuts to Medicare. 2. Cuts to social security. 3. Cuts to Obamacare. 4. Cuts to a large number of other social programs. Heres the list of things youre willing to give up: 1. Nothing. This is not a negotiation. You dont want to have a conversation, you want to dictate terms. For a negotiation to take place there needs to be a certain amount of give and take. All I see is a list of demands. Do as I say or Ill burn down your house is not a negotiation tactic - its a threat. Some might even call it extortion. You have allowed time, energy and money on votes against the Affordable Care Act 42 times on any given day knowing you don?t have the votes, yet can?t quite seem to bring a vote to the floor to keep the nation running and not take the economy further down because you say we need to trust you that no one would vote for it. The GOP refused to negotiate on a budget for most of the year, and now put countless families out of income (which many probably cant fiscally survive) as a means to get their way on an issue that theyve lost on- that has already been voted and signed into LAW. Every other time a president negotiated during these crises it was never about undoing a law that the other side didnt like. Weve had the conversation and it didnt go the way Republicans wanted. That said, Republicans love to raise the Debt Ceiling when theyre in office. More specifically, it lists 18 increases to the debt ceiling between February 1981 and September 1987 under President Ronald Reagan. There were seven increases between January 2001 and January 2009 during George W. Bushs presidency. Now suddenly the party is against raising the Debt Ceiling? The absolute inconsistencies and outright lies that you are spouting are truly disturbing. It?s all too easy to take away someone else?s living when you still have a heavy wallet. This entire situation is a scam by the American Congress to leave the American people- the people that Congress supposedly represents- high and dry. Are we living in a democracy if our representatives are not representing us? No. ter?ror?ism noun 1. The use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. You are using intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. You are an extremist. By this definition, you are a terrorist. A vote needs to be called, and this pointless and immature shutdown needs to end. Sincerely, [ohgollyitslolly] P.S. I very much encourage you to stop claiming to represent the American people. I absolutely do not agree with your current actions, and I know countless others who concur. Instead, perhaps start saying what you really mean: the Tea Party.* "
"If only obama would crawl to my office, show me his respect for the Office of the Speaker of the House and properly address me as Mr. Speaker, then we can begin to have a conversation. obama can start doing the business of the American public by repealing obamacare, repealing social security, repealing medicare, repealing all gun laws, quadruple military spending, institute the death penalty for gays, lesbians and even men who look kind of female, but you arent sure? I want them dead too. Then, when weve finally had that simple conversation, we can begin to negotiate on the resignations of Justice Breyer, Alito, Kagan and Sotomayer. We can begin to negotiate on restricting democratic seats to no more than 10 in the House and 1 in the Senate - after all I want your voices to be heard, but honestly, Id rather you all just shut up. Then, I want obama and Vice President Biden to resign. Now, I believe, through a quirk of the constitution, that someone would need to take over as President. I believe, if I remember my civics class that... gee, well I guess it would be me, wouldnt it. -- Speaker of the House"
This so needs to be autotuned.
The title is grossly false. He neither loses it nor offers (verifiable) lies. He actually handled himself quite well doing what politicians do best--avoiding the questions and proffering their positions. 
"Is this the same Obama that voted against raising the debt limit in 2006? Or have we just all conveniently forgot that? Is this a case of the usual its ok if a democrat does it, not a republican? http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/847627 "
Hitting the scotch early in the day? He seemed pretty shit-faced in that interview.

Credit to George Stephanopoulos. He really grilled Boehner on this. True journalism.
"The Republic plan, has been and always will be to, to deny any achievements to President Obama (not matter how small or large) in order to show that he was at the helm when the country went to shit. Then, the GOP can go back and point to history and say Look, that Black Democratic President was in charge when the country lost its credit rating, crashed the economy into recession, and defaulted on its debt. We werent in charge! Its all their fault. So, elect US and well make it better! All the while trying to re-write history to show that it wasnt them, the Republic GOP, Koch brothers, Limbaugh, Hannity, and Fox News that brought the country to its knees and took away health care for the most needy. Its been their plan all along and theyve almost achieved that goal... almost."
I didnt come to washington to be a congressmen... ...Obviously. Asshole.
"doesnt he realize that people see him as that crazy, batshit psycho ex who made ridiculous ultimatums just to make you go through their hoops? Except, instead of sex, we are losing a stable government."
This jerkoff has absolutely *no idea what the people want* - he only knows what *the Koch suckers want* - he has to ask them for permission to even use the bathroom...
When President Obama responds he should just use the line The United States does not negotiate with terrorists and sew up the next election. 
When the investigations hes heading are over.
He does seem to be getting a little too close to the truth. Time to shut him down.
I bet that republican-controlled legislatures will require the teaching of the benghazi-gate scandal that isnt a scandal in high school political science classes.

" What we do know is that a number of GOP have used government funds that were never approved. This was documented in 2011 when GOP house ways and means committee when on a witch hunt over the IRS status of AARP. There were serious questions about who actually funded that research as the head of the subcommittee agreed that the Subcommittee / Committee did. That should have gone to Ethics...did it? NOPE.

"You do it the moment Democrats retake the House and use their newfound powers to hold hearings on the abuse of power weve witnessed from House Republicans.

He needs to be placed in a straight jacket and medicated...with some Big Pharma.
"He terms out from his committee chair after this year. I swear, though, if a guy has the bully pulpit and subpoena power for five straight years and cant find a single damn real issue to pursue, hes either stupider than a brain-dead horse or Obama is the cleanest politician in American history. But if we are going to investigate him, insurance fraud and arson would be a good place to start...."
When he burned his own business to the ground would have been a good time. Or during his career as a car thief would have been good. 
Wait so Forward Progressives is shitting on a Republican?? Astounding. 
About five years ago would have been good.
"Lyndon Johnson once said, Democrats legislate,Republicans investigate. I assume they do so based on the knowledge that they would cheat and steal, so Democrats must also. Issa wont be investigated. Not as long as the GOP controls the House...They protect each other. Now, I would wish that the Civil Authorities would reopen some of the investigations in Mr. Issa..maybe lean on a few people who know him well and get someone to turn States Evidence. Hes a crook! And while Mark Twain said the only native Criminal Class in America was Congress, I doubt he envisioned someone like Issa. Hes a disgrace to all Americans, even Republicans who look the other way."
"What did I just read? I mean, what is that? How can anybody think of something like that, humorously or not?"

Obamacares a Bailout Now? Conservative Critics Are Getting Desperate http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116230/why-obamacare-not-bailout-insurers
"Some risk, but its still a could be, up to, if thing. "
So I guess defunding the NSA is out of the question for mr Obama. 
So do something about it Obama. Put some fuck it into your policy and go for it already.
Agreed. But we could cut spending if the money were better managed anyway.
"But there always seems to be money for the, NSA, CIA, FBI, DEA, and the military. Seriously much of that could be cut, starting with the DEA, which could practically be eliminated. Stop engaging in wars, stop spying needlessly spying on everyone, no more corporate welfare, just to name a few of the many ways the US government could balance it budget and provide services the citizens actually need."
"As a former teacher that has worked in many bad schools, and some good ones, Im absolutely sick and tired of the its for the kids argument. The kids can go to hell. I dealt with so many terrible ones who just didnt give a damn about their free education. The ones in the middle class, WHITE, well-off areas were fantastic, respectful students. No problems there. The ones in the inner city were just awful. It has NOTHING to do with money spent on their food or education. They ate like kings and had everything the white school districts had. They just dont understand the value of an education. They dont understand what respect or morals are. And before anyone says this is because theyre poor and disadvantaged, the white and Asian poor kids never had any trouble behaving or doing their work. Many were, in terms of attitude, no different to their suburban counterparts. The African-American ones were terrible. No respect whatsoever. Couldnt care less about them. People keep making excuses for their shit, and Im tired of it. And before anyone calls me a racist that hates blacks, know that Im from the Caribbean and mixed with black. We value an education down there and dont behave like animals. Wed never let our students get away with this shit like Americas white liberals do."
"Even if we can afford it, spending on education does not correlate with higher results."
"I saw we bring all the troops home, slash the defense budget. And put that money into school. Invest in children, dont spend their future defending oil companies. "
"We need to return to high standards of corporate responsibility and the end of government influence used to avoid this responsibility. Corporations are legal people you say? Fine they shall be held to high standards of personal responsibility like normal people. What does this mean? They should pay for the direct and indirect costs and consequences of their actions. For example: * If an industry relies on government guarantees and bailouts, they shall pay a supplementary tax to cover the costs of these guarantees and bailouts. * If an industry creates bubbles and push the bubbles risks to the government and the people they shall pay a supplementary tax for the cost of this risk. * If an industry relies on government soldiers to secure access to oil wells, they shall pay a supplementary tax that cover the price of the war enterprises. * If an industry destroys valuable resources, and the wealth of future generations, they shall pay for the damage they cause. The rule is simple: pay for the damage you have caused and regulate yourself so you don?t cause this damage again. Once it is clear the externalities have been internalized, that the regulations prevent the dumping of costs on others, the supplementary taxes can be removed. This is not class warfare. We dont have anything against the legitimately rich that profit by creating value. We are only against those corporation who free ride the system, exploit its infrastructure, its government provided services, and through government influence avoid paying their fair share and dump their costs on everyone else. We will not be satisfied until, those who benefit from government largess and bailouts, pay for these benefits, and until the channels of influence they used to dump the costs on others are closed. "
"?The problem is, is that the way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion dollars for the first 42 presidents -- number 43 added $4 trillion dollars by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion dollars of debt that we are going to have to pay back -- $30,000 for every man, woman and child. Thats irresponsible. Its unpatriotic.? ~ candidate Obama July 3, 2008. Dont be fooled."
This is something I would expect a potential candidate to say about what the current administration is doing. Motherfucker has been the president for 5 years. Time to stop thinking out loud and having conversations with yourself and start acting like a president.
We need a long term plan that defunds our huge defense budget.
"Obama says a lot of things, hes very selective about what he follows through on though and in some cases he makes a complete 180"
Presidential lesson 1: avoid tough questions and topics by inserting children into the conversation 
Obama doesnt want to hear about a lot of things these days.
"We are not going to be helping our childrens educations until we stop being stuck on this more money will make things better bullshit. The government seems to have only two plans to improve education, more funding and more hours/days in school. Well, more money hasnt seemed to help, and many countries that outperform us spend LESS time in school per year than we already have. I never see any substantial changes put forth by the government. Ideas from people like Ken Robinson that could greatly benefit our children seem to be completely ignored."
"Heres a solution stop sending billions of dollars to countries that fucking hate us. Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt etc etc. "
Stop giving aid to Israel.
"In this thread: Dozens of trolls deflecting the issue. We can and will think more than one issue is important at a time, and we are allowed to discuss education as an important issue."
Maybe Obama should lead by example and cut funding to the NSA
Obama said &lt;insert some common sense that all people want but it wont happen&gt;
Can anyone explain to me or post a link where it shows that the government lost billions of dollars due to the shutdown? Is this in decreased economic benefits such as lost tax revenue?
"We can afford to maintain 10 times the amount of debt we currently have. It is criminally stupid to cut spending when we could be borrowing at 0% interest. If the money spent this way is used for infrastructure or education, it will or should bring about economic growth far in excess of the debt incurred. As the economy grows, so does the ability of the government to handle even more debt. What is the point of having no debt as a government? No successful business would decline to borrow at 0% interest in order to expand their operations and profits. No homeowner with a job would turn down a mortgage at 0% interest if it meant they could send their kids to really good schools. Why should the government of the most powerful country on earth not borrow at 0% interest to make investments in the education of our countrys students? Even if we paid off the debt entirely, our government would be stupid to not immediately borrow more money. Remember, we take in 10 times the amount of money per month in revenue than we need to pay out in debt service. If you can pay the service on the debt, if you have 10 times the amount of money that it takes to pay the service on the debt, then the debt is not a problem. "
"Even aside from all the shutdown nonsense, Forbes just came out with a report last week showing that the Obama administration is the lowest spending administration since Eisenhower. And yet that still is out of control spending according to the Republicans. What a crock of shit. http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/05/24/who-is-the-smallest-government-spender-since-eisenhower-would-you-believe-its-barack-obama/ edit: correction, the report was reintroduced last week, but was first released in May 12."
"http://thehill.com/video/administration/330715-obama-says-he-doesnt-want-to-hear-about-spending-cuts Obama says he doesnt want to hear about spending cuts. ?Dont tell me we can afford to shut down the government, which costs our government billions of dollars, but we cant afford to invest in our kids,? Obama said at a school in Brooklyn. "
He didnt want to hear about spending cuts long before the government shutdown.
I know this is crazy... but why dont we cut military spending? Edit: there are good points for and against here.
I dont want to hear about spending cuts either -unless it comes from defense. The middle class and the poor have been raped enough.
"Then lets see you do something about it, Mr. President. Talk is cheap. "
"[Were spending 3x as much (inflation-adjusted) on schools as we did in 1970s with no improvement in academic achievement](http://www.cato.org/publications/congressional-testimony/impact-federal-involvement-americas-classrooms). The avg cost per class of 25 kids nationwide is over $250,000 each year ($10k/student... as high as $30k in L.A. and D.C.), a clearly absurd cost that is 3x what it would likely cost if parents paid directly. Instead, the govt middleman overcharges us to implement a bureaucracy of administrators who micromanage everything. In this day and age, with the internet, there is no excuse for K-12 education to cost more than $1k a year."
"**Breaking:** Obama says all the right things, but will he deliver? Probably not."
I wish a non republican/democrat could actually get elected. Gary Johnson plug
"If we can afford undeclared wars in 70 countries, we can take care of our kids."
Words. Thats all. How much is going to defense? To surveillance? 
"Hey, heres this thing we should spend money on! Dont pay attention to all those other wasteful things were spending money on now."
I think the people at this school are not trying to tell him that.. 
The lack of education and the tea party sort of feed into each other... 
"Dont tell me we can afford to drone strike militants and *foreign* kids, which costs our government [$30,000 per hour of operation (not including ordinance) plus the $5B we spent on R&amp;D and procurement in 2012 alone](http://fcnl.org/issues/foreign_policy/understanding_drones/), but we cant afford to invest in *our* kids, Obama said in my head. I should write a book called Rhetoric for Fun and Profit. Edit: included source of cost"

Holy crap - the conservative shills really came out for this post. *slow clap*
We cant afford either. 
"God damnit Obama, I am really starting to like you again...And I have a feeling that youre going to disappoint me and eventually cave on more spending cuts in some sort of grand bargain... But for now, I will enjoy this side of you and will encourage you to keep it up. "
Dont tell me we can waste billions in pork when we can invest in our education. There is tons of wasted dollars in government spending that could be better used.
"So the government shuts down because there wasnt money to run it, but it cost money to shut it down. The reality distortion field is strong on this one."
I hope he uses that government shut down at every opportunity. Just because it would be funny. Also: Shots fired.
I want to know the math behind how furloughing all those unessential government jobs cost us money. How much are we paying all these people and to do what?
This statement ignores the fact that running the government costs even more billions. 
"Yeah, because there is SO little waste in government."
"Didnt you all get the russell brand memo? Stop giving these crooks and stooges your time, money, attention, or votes. I will brace myself for the onslaught of sheeple downvotes now. ooooBAAAAAAAmmmAAAAAAA"
"This government is so bloated that the repercussions are insurmountable to future generations. Only those politicians that are serious about shrinking government and government spending, versus those that add to the vulgar spending and over-taxation in the USA, should be voted into office, seriously."
national debt when Obama took office - $8 tril national debt now - $17 tril
"Oh cool! Does that also mean hes interested in seeing industries present that will actually employ our kids when they finish their education? Im certainly not implying that its a presidents responsibility to create job opportunities, but offering big tax incentives as a reward for domestic investment that creates living-wage work might be a start. Investing in kids has a smaller meaning when opportunities are scarce and a few rungs of the social ladder have been offshored. "
"Sorry, but fuck Obama. I voted for him twice and have regretted it. He still focuses on education as a way to employment...rather than a way to thinking about things. "
ITT: So many people who think they know economics but in realoty have no freakin clue...
Print more money!!!
"Classic two-faced Obama. Next, he goes back to Washington to cut a bunch of social funds. "
"Words, nothing more than air."
Education quality has gone down every year since the department of education was created.
talk is cheap loser
Military spending is basically just welfare under a more popular name as far as I can tell. 
We should cut the defense budget and cut some of our overseas bases and put all that money back into education and infrastructure. 
BUT WILL HE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?
Students at the school graduate with both a high school diploma and an associate degree in computers or engineering. What?! Thats awesome. Does anyone know how many schools offer this? 
"The Presidents concern for our children is laudable..., though there is a bit of a disconnect since he obviously has no reluctance in passing on to them $trillions in debt."
Of course he doesnt. Spending cuts only buy votes of people that have money.
Obama making speeches in favorable venues... Brooklyn.. 90% on welfare. 
only in obama world could shutting down government cost more money. How much stupid koolaid do people have to drink to listen to this guy and keep a straight face.
Explain to me how shutting down the government costs us money?
"Meanwhile, [we already spend more on education than any other country in the world](http://m.cbsnews.com/storysynopsis.rbml?pageType=world&amp;url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57590921/&amp;catid=57590921), yet education outcomes in our public schools are comparable to those in Eastern European countries. A lack of funding is not the problem. "
...Spending money vs. Making money... Those two things arent the same
"No where on the planet is more money spent on big government education with less to show for it. About all we get for the massive funding is an all-powerful teachers union creating crippling student loan debt in lieu of degrees. Its not like we are graduating well-educated citizens ready for gainful employment in a modern world. Rather, this education system spews out disaffected masses who are capable of little but voting for handouts. Clearly, if we look at the facts, the current government education system has failed the children and failed society. Giving this bloated system more money is not going to change this for the better."
"Lets look at the score shall we. Bush inherited a yearly 300 billion dollar surplus and left us a 1.2 trillion dollar yearly deficit. A large part of that deficit caused by the tax cuts, which as late as [2006 we were projected to return to surplus as soon as ALL of the bush tax cuts expired.](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/aug/07/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-was-path-balanced-budget-when/)(we have a revenue problem not a spending one) So we come to the big first battle between Obama and the GOP. The GOP won 1.8 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years. 1.1 trillion from the sequester, another 600-700 billion in new budget cuts from Obama for free.(to the gop for free.. he didnt get nothing for that 600-700billion) Obama won the bush tax cuts which were supposed to expire 2 years prior, he got them to expire on the top 1%, or people making over 400k a year.......... IN A PAYCHECK. ok he [did roll back capital gains some.. which were also to expire on their own but this also for people making over 400k](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/1/increase-the-capital-gains-and-dividends-taxes-for/) which got Obama 600 billion out of 1.3 trillion in bush tax cuts.lets not forget Obama cut taxes further as part of the stim. and lets not really forget, these revenues that obama won were his already. He could have sat on his ass and vetoed anything that extended them and they all would have expired. Not saying that is a good idea in a shaky economy but **so far the GOP have won nearly 2 trillion in cuts, and obama won 600 billion in revenues that were already his.** ANd all of this to pay for the mess of the bush admin [which they didnt fund](http://www.pensitoreview.com/2009/12/29/hatch-deficit-spending-was-standard-practice-not-to-pay-for-things-under-bush-gop-congress/), as part of their [starve the beast program.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast). its like your boss getting you to agree to longer houses and you getting him to agree to cut your pay check in half. And your boss claiming both sides won something. One last thing, Im going to bold, If you look at how much Obama has cut the deficit and yes I understand that the will might not have been there in a diffferent world but **Had obama inherited a government with no deficit**, no surplus, no deficit, **we would be nearly 200 billion a year in surplus** Besides he REALLY sucks at negotiating, and the entire continue the NSA thing, he isnt that bad of a president."

"So Obamas pulling out the populism I see, making statements about spending cuts being unacceptable when he knows damn well therell need to be trimmings somewhere. Its a classic political ploy. Anyone on the Republican party with the gall to say lets try to keep this deficit down by cutting spending here and there will be lamblasted as being a crook. Normally Id be against unfair political plays like this, but its worth it to see the far right nuts squirm."
"If this were said at the beginning of his first term, I might lend credence to it.....but after what weve seen in his time in office, I pretty much believe the exact opposite of what he says. He started out with so much support from a lot of Americans, but he really screwed the pooch. "
"He sure is good at *saying* things, isnt he?"
"Were about 400,000 teachers shy of where we would have been if it werent for The Great Disaster Capitalism Cataclysm. How about a jobs stimulus of 500,000 - 1,000,000 new education careers? Better bang for your buck, jobs-wise, than the military."
Ah more words. Well thank you Mr.President you always say such great things.
"Its about time he actually said this. Hey GOP **IDIOTS**, when you cut spending, you cut jobs. When you cut jobs, you slow down the economy. In other words, when you cut workers, say, at the DMV, they will no longer go to the gas station they were filling up from, each week, on the way to work. They wont go to the Dunkin Donuts for coffee. They wont buy their lunch from the local deli. They wont be buying new things for their home, clothes for their kids, so on and so forth. This affects small businesses TREMENDOUSLY. Those small business owners cannot afford to staff as many people, so they have to cut hours and jobs themselves. And, then those people cant buy gas and go to McDonalds, which then gets less money, and cuts jobs and... do you see now? In a poor economy, cutting costs, which cut jobs (aka Austerity) is the worst thing possible. You should cut when things are good, after reviving things completely. Stop playing the Im on the other team bullshit and start being part of reality. Note: I do recognize there is waste, but now is NOT the time. It grinds things to a halt to do it now, and drags out recoveries forever. You only cut back when times are good, since the surplus can be cut from. Ugh."
"Uh.. how about we cant afford either?? The great propagandist strikes again... The great nation of imbeciles eats it up without a thought, as per usual. "
"Yeah, okay Obama, okay. You save those children! As you watch education in the US fall apart."
"Dont tell me we can afford to use drones to kill Pakistani kids, but we cant afford to invest in our kids."
"Putting money in schools doesnt do jack shit. American education system isnt going to be saved by dumping money into random shit, but by spending it wisely on actual important subjects. For example, teachers will just stop giving a shit about students who dont want to learn and just waste everybodys time and money. Grade everybody the same with no leeways. I dont understand how nobody understands this still. "
Why does it cost money to shut down the government?! 
http://youtu.be/Qh2sWSVRrmo
"Or we could keep military spending, and cut congressional pay, presidential pay, sell all the unnecessary shit the government doesnt need, like the NSA, then we all live happily ever after"
"Well some spending has to be cut eventually,could we all agree on that?"
The guy sure can talk the talk. Unfortunately he doesnt have such a great track record for walking the walk. 
The sequester was Obamas idea. Funny how he is against it when asked and then baskes in the glory that the deficit is lower this year. But hey I got an idea lets cut the NSA.
Whats with this guy and using our kids and the children to push his agenda? It really pisses me off - he did the same thing with the gun control.. protect the children.. keep our children safe.
Obama says a lot if things. Im tired of his PR bullshit. 
"Key word said this guy seems to say a lot of stuff, wheres the results? "
Yeah Obamas right! Someone should do something about that! .. 
"on the one hand, theres that old stereotype of the tax and spend liberals. On the other hand, we also have debt and spend big govt conservatives, and cut and dont spend small govt conservative/libertarians. And in the middle, you have other liberals and moderates who will do whatever is most likely to get them elected. Usually they elected by both cutting taxes and keeping welfare, which is an unhealthy long-term way to handle a welfare state. Personally, Id rather not destroy the whole welfare state. It works pretty well, but only when it is adequately funded. Right now it is not being funded enough because people look for loopholes (entire industries of corporate lawyers and accountants helping the rich find them), and there is incredible waste in a few key but well lobbied entitlements. Hope we can find a solution"
When I read the top new posts in here I get a sense it could be anti Obama astroturfing by some nefarious group. Or are these opinions actually common in the states?
I can hear Obamas pandering from here.
If the public school system took 1% of the military budget we would have some of the best schools in the world and still have the most bloated military spending the world has ever seen.
We cant afford either...
"One day we will have to tell our grandkids what is was like being alive during the worst presidency ever, not because we brought it up, but because they heard about it in social studies."
Where the hell was this Obama in 2008?
Well thats just equivocating the word afford.
"How about we cut spending ACROSS THE BOARD. Something drastic like 40%? Everything gets cut. Then, watch as politicians scramble to make it all work and pass a balanced budget. The sequestration worked because it was painful cuts, and guess what happened? Government agencies made tough choices and made it work."
Obama says a lot of shit.
"Unfortunately, POTUSs idea of investing in our kids is the Common Core Curriculum that puts billions of dollars into testing companies like Pearson while reducing the definition of learning to scoring well on multiple-choice tests. Common Core ostensibly prepares students for the workforce of the 21st century. I dont know about anyone else, but Ive never faced a life problem or a work problem that came with five choices: -one designed to trick me into picking it -one thats the opposite of what I should do -one thats flat-out wrong -one thats right -and one thats *more* right."
"Actually Barack, we cant invest in our kids because you blew all the money on imperialism, militarism, regime change, drone strikes, NSA espionage, and bailing out the banksters. Just sayin"
"Not that I am against investing in kids but I am getting tired of the constant faulty political bullshit put forth as some unassailable logical argument. Just because the government was shut down doesnt mean we could afford it, so using that logic to justify further spending is just stupid. &gt; Oh gee I had a medical emergency and had to put it on my credit card, I guess that means I can afford to buy these great new jeans I saw the other day!"
Did he actually grow some balls during the shutdown?
 The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics. Thomas Sowell

"Isnt it ironic how the Republicans are for smaller government, less taxes, and less bureaucracy, but when it comes to the military they want it as bloated and inefficient as possible?"
"Thats like going out and blowing a bunch of money on beer and then saying dont tell me we cant buy school supplies when we just wasted a bunch of money on beer. We cant because we waste our money on illegal spying by the NSA ($50 billion / yr); wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and posturing near Korea; a completely broken healthcare system covered in paper mache thats already losing its gloss called Obamacare; bailing out banks; and $1 billion tax refund to GE (GE pays negative taxes each year). After all that waste, theres not a lot left over for the kids. In comparison, the Government shutdown was a very minor cost. Ironically, it was shut down to try and reduce some of that waste."
I dont know how I feel pouring more money into a failing education system ran by admins that are mostly interested in securing funding.
But the shut down was Obamas fault 
"Doesnt matter, without a massive overhaul the dollar will collapse, and the American economy with it. That massive overhaul will never happen due to the bi-partisan monopoly."
If one thing I learned about Obama in his years as president....he talks tough but doesnt act out on anything. Sold a dream but turned out to be just another puppet politician.
The substance of this article is indirectly proportional to its upvotes. 
*But think of the children!* Please. Thats the Appeal to Dead Puppies argument.
"We do need budget cuts. But not for things like that. Top four spending things Medicare Medicade, defense, and social security. Cut from them "
Many people dont believe that money spent on education or infrastructure is an investment. They see it only as money going out.
the republicans really handed democrats a loaded gun on this one.
hell still sign whatever bill they put in front of him
"...as he continues to drone bomb the shit out of Pakistan, killing kids. Makes sense. "
Politics as usual. 
Why is this front page news? This is just rhetoric as usual.
"Well... its the Executive Branch who decides to spend billions of dollars doing stupid crap during a shutdown, like putting up cones to block the view of Mt. Rushmore. All the Legislative does is delay non-essential spending."
"Wait, shutting down the government costs the government money? Lolwut? "
"Too bad those kids in Brooklyn cant do a fucking thing about it. Tell that shit to people in Congress or the Senate. Grandstanding isnt doing anything for anybody, and frankly, Im sick of your shit Obama. After this NSA crap, no more apologetics or justification for you. DO YOUR FUCKING JOB, and do it right."
"This is coming from the same guy that stated, raising the debt ceiling doesnt raise our debt one cent. Then why call it the DEBT ceiling?"
Im always surprised by the amount of people that truly believe giving the government MORE power is the solution to our problems. 
"If you are $13 trillion in debt, you need to cut spending AND raise taxes. Obama is silly for refusing to cut spending."
"You know what would resolve all our problems? Ceasing all job security for federal workers, raising wages for the productive and releasing the lazy and inefficient. "
Anyone who believes in this statement clearly doesnt look at the big picture... Quotes likes these are all political games. 
Whos he talking to? Himself? 
That Obamas name? Albert Einstein.
Hes right.
"Obama, you are a principled guy, too bad our corporatocracy doesnt allow you to be president and never will allow anyone to truly run this country. I wonder what he really thinks about other things."
Obama. Youre forcing the *KIDS* to invest in *YOU*. The money for Obamacare is coming from the millions of healthy young people who otherwise wouldnt need to buy insurance. Dont pretend like youre doing anything for *US*. 
Who gives a fuck what he says. He never follows through.
"Oh geez, get ready to bend over, when the politicians start trotting out schools and infrastructure youre going to get raped. For 5 years, Obama hasnt seemed to show any interest in education, but now that hes on the warpath to fight for more spending, this is where he goes, so that a bunch of soccer moms will fall in line behind spending on the other 95% of what he wants. It makes me sick. The TP should call his bluff, and offer to double the spending on schools if we halve spending on everything else, and watch his sudden interest in education slither away."
"You cant balance the budget without either cutting spending, raising taxes, or both. Fortunately we are spending far too much on defense so cutting that would raise plenty of revenue without actually causing damage to national security the way an underfunded school system does systemically. Simple, though damaging if you profit from the military industrial machine (and who doesnt) We also live in a time when the most wealthy are party to generous tax allowances and offshore holdings loopholes, so all we have to do is bring those back to like half of what they were in the 50s (Estate tax anybody?). Pretty easy answers, if youre not solely concerned with politics and succumbing to your own emotions. Im so glad we have such well tempered leaders who place the proper practice of civics above politics."
"Im confused, should I be happy or angry at Obama?"
"So I have been to a couple different high schools in my life, and the school Im at now has the lowest funding in the state, but its also the most prestigious public school in the state. The schools around me are not nearly as good as mine but they receive a lot more money to which they spend it on iPads and laptops for every student.... Theres a lot more to it then this, but you need a lot of money to educate students. Its all determined on how much hard work they put in their classes, and they only need a good old fashioned text book to get the job dont. "
"..uhm, I dont usually try to seek conspiracies, but my guts are telling me that this was staged in order to gain trust in Obama. I mean he said it before, something along the lines of a need to build up a trust among Americans in their government, and what better way to do it by touching an emotional subject like children and money. Politicians have to be strategists in the first place, because they are aware that every word they say can sway public opinion and masses, media included, can easily misinterpret information from them. This couldnt have come as something sudden to Obama, he mustve expected it, sure there is his personal opinion which probably is just and agrees to what he said here, but he clearly didnt say it blindly just because it is his opinion. But I might be wrong and even if I am not, I dont see anything wrong with this way of doing things, because no good politician can be a fully honest person with nothing to hide, he has to lead a country and no matter the goals, be it money, be it happiness of citizens, he cant be fully honest, he can only try to appear as a good politician or a bad one."
"Seeing that the fed govmt spends an average of about $6 billion per day, Im unimpressed by Obamas comments. Thats an insanely large number and i dont see how thats sustainable over the long run. "
Obama says a lot of things.
"Then fucking do something god damnit! So much talk from both sides about we shouldnt do this, but we should do this! when in reality we know that there isnt a single 100% correct way of fixing this problem. I just want to see some initiative!! I know there are good Congressmen/women there right now who want to do something, so they should actually try!!"
"Boo hoo, the kids are our future. Then why burden them with debt?"
"Obama never wants to hear about cuts but wants more money, more money, more money for programs that do not work."
Good thing we already have one of the highest public education costs per student in the world with some of the lowest test scores. Not sure more money is the solution. We arent going to be doing anyone any favors till we get rid of the teachers unions. 
"Hes right, theres no way we should be firing anybody right now. You cant fix our biggest problem (unemployment) by making it worse. We should be spending more until people are back to work and the economy is growing again."
"So, I thought that the point of the shutdown was that we were getting too close to the debt ceiling and we needed to slow down spending... How did shutting down cost us billions? "
"yeah...perhaps it would be prudent for the obama administration to stop spending 3/4 of our budget on needless genocidal WARS then....oops, nobody is supposed to point that out, right? "
I do all I can to negotiate with republicans I just dont listen to their point of view? What part of the shutdown cost billions? The BS with the national parks and monuments and lost taxes? I am pretty sure the GOP did not demand that guards be employed to make sure no one got into the national parks or monuments. If anything the democrats chose to shutdown the most public faces of the government to incite fear.
"Yet we spend billions of dollars each year investing in Afghanistan, a country that offers us absolutely 0 value."
The people watching fox news think Obama is the one that shut down the Government.
"I find this very funny, because if a politician says we should cut a program they dont like it is because we cant afford it or dont need it, but if you want to cut funding of a program they do like it creates jobs. The truth is that all spending goes back to the economy in some way all with different ROI. Infrastructure spending, Education, R&amp;D all go back to the economy very well. Military spending has diminishing returns. Because if you spend 10 million on a bridge you now have a bridge and the jobs that build it. But if you spend 10 million on a bomb and blow up a bridge in another country, all you have is rubble, and the jobs to design and build the bomb. However most of that money goes to a giant corporation instead of construction workers who spend their paychecks almost immediately thus growing the economy. So at the end of the day you are left with corporations vs the people and rich vs poor. Considering who pulls the strings behind politicians on either side of the aisle actual change is almost impossible."
"Fuck the Republicans for being partisan hacks but also, fuck Obama for being a partisan hack and a two faced hypocrite. This article is basically pandering by saying hes investing in children, so support him. Yeah right. His buddy Rahm in Chicago cut like like 50 inner city school and any new schools that get built are going to line someones pockets."
"Im really tired of the kids card. HES PLAYING WITH YOUR EMOTIONS! More money does not equal better education, especially not with the terrible education programs like No Child Left Behind. If politicians really want to invest in kids then how about taking the financial burden of higher education off the shoulders of students."
"nobody has to tell you anything, you are the president. &lt;- Obamas biggest problem"
"well, obama, you have been in office long enough, maybe you could, i dunno, find a way to invest more in kids?"
"I have no faith in that man anymore. He have broken and gone back on almost every single policy and promise. Fuck off, mr President...go somewhere else with your lies and broken promises!"
"I just love the spin. Are you stupid, citizen? Shutting down non-essential services and cutting government waste *costs* money! The only way to save money is to spend more on government!! Raising taxes is good for you too, since Im only going to raise the other persons taxes!"
"Until I see the national debt start decreasing, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss2hULhXf04"
Do it for the children! You simply have to open your wallet when they say that ... right?
Oh shut up Obama. So tired of this failed leader.
We cant afford to shut down our government though. That kind of argument is not really valid.
"No no no, dont give me this pointing the finger. Theyre all to blame. Dont tell me we can afford a war when we cant afford to invest in our kids, our health, and our prosperity. Thanks Obama."
king obama should just fire up his money printer and just print all the money they lost during the shutdown. 
Sham-wow can take his rhetoric elsewhere. The idiot shut down the Government to protect the greatest failed legislation in the history of our Nation. What a loser.
i wish POTUS would say this to lawmakers instead of schoolchildren..
double plus good double speak brother citizen
"Disband the NSA,theres a good 20 million already a year."
thanks obama
I wouldnt characterize it as he doesnt want to hear about spending cuts. What happened is that the media got ahold of a soundbite where the president who was at a school expressed opposition to cutting spending for schools.
I say we cut the military budget in half but with the stipulation that soldiers need to be safer and better paid then they already are. 
"tl;dr: when you cut spending, you lay off government employees and stop contracts with private business. When you lose tax payers and consumers, deficits and debt increases"
"I see this aa political move. I liked the President Obama I saw during the debate ceiling debate. That was a line I was fine with drawing. But I think some limited spending cuts in the right place is acceptable when tax increases are included as well. As far as spending cuts, I think the politics of it will demand that we do. That said, given the democrats control 2/3 of the Federal government, I expect we should see some tax increases with some spending cuts(a smaller amount of the later) Anyone serious about balancing the budget(or getting close to it) should have both spending cuts and tax increases on the table. One or the other isnt a practical solution. I lean towards one over the other, but I think of compromise of the two ideas is reasonable. (unlike defaulting, which was not ever an acceptable move)"
I dont understand how this even got a single upvote. Is everyone here new to politics?
Uh oh approval is going down better make some blanket statement about child education to get them back on my side. - Obama
So not cutting spending is ok?
spending cuts are necessary but NOT in education. obama is playing politician
Funny that Senator Obama said something completely opposite. 
***Why doesnt anybody think about the children!!??!!***
Military spending should be cut. But it is. We need to overhaul healthcare. A universal healthcare system would solve nearly all budget problems.
[deleted]
Barry never saw a spending bill he didnt love.
What kids? Certainly not the kids in the ghetto -- So white kids? 
"When I hear Obama said I think back to Reagan hating on taxes then more than doubling them... Doesnt matter what they say, its what they do."
Hmmmm... A politician telling a select group of people exactly what they want to hear to make them like him. God that is brilliant.
Wouldnt shutting down the government save money since less people are working?
"Reminds me of that movie about MC Hammer. He didnt want any budget cuts, either. But they happened, in the end."
"Invest in our kids? We spend billions of dollars in education every year. What are you smoking, Mr. President?"
Obama sounds more like Hitler every single day. Everything I do is for the protection of the kids.
"This sort of comment is why I said a few weeks ago that BOTH sides truly were to blame for the shutdown and almost default: Obama is essentially saying hes not willing to negotiate... whether you agree with his stance or not (and I for one very much do agree with him when were talking about education) you have to realize that the attitude hes presenting is one that will lead to roadblocks to getting things done. Granted, it wont be the ONLY reason, but that only matters in retrospect when history judges, not so much when youre living through the problems. "
Whenever I hear a politician talk about kids I assume they are up to something. What? You dont support alpaca farming subsidies? Do you hate children?
Ummmmmmmmmmm....How does shutting down the government cost it billions of dollars? Theyre still taking in tax dollars and not paying salaries at the same time. Seems like it saves money.
"Im for education, but I feel giving schools wireless Internet isnt needed. "
"Question: I am in my 40s and have been hearing for decades that we need to invest more money into our schools. But after we keep spending more and more, the kids scholastic achievements keep declining? ELI5 how more money is the solution. "
So why doesnt he invest in children?? Hes been there long enough. 
Its about time he pulled out a couple stops.
"Hah, Ive first read &gt; Obama says he doesnt want to hear about *spying* cuts."
"That is good that he brings that up. Shutting down the government again in January/February when Republicans get their next shot at a hostage crisis, is going to get that up amount up again, too. $49 billion here, $49 billion there, pretty soon youre talking real money."
where is all this extra money going to come from? we need a balanced budget.
"The government faces no solvency or financial constraints. As long as Obama and his followers pay obeisance to the balanced budget gods, they will never be able to fight Republicans on this."
yea because its for the kids guys! 
Reminds me of this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOh-rpvjYg&amp;feature=youtube_gdata
"Oh yeah, theyll tell you that and any other twisted story whoever pays for their campaigns will tell them."
"Get your head out of your ass reddit, your left wing arguments are predictable and simplistic."
reddit will eat this up
"/r/circlejerk , tired of your shit reddit."
But they spend billions upon billions spying on our citizens and allies. Our government is so fucked
we NEED to cut spending. we also NEED to invest more into our futures and we NEED to increase the intake of government funds. why is it we can never talk about everything? its always talk about A and C while B and D are off the table? I want to see us talk about the entirety of the government budget and agencies with FUCKING EVERYTHING on the table! this shit pissed me off how we go from democrats wanting to increase spending and tweak the tax code a bit and we have republicans wanting to cut taxes and decrease spending. what more infuriating is looking at the end results of each parties wants and seeing they both do the same fucking shit.
Obama blaming everyone but himself as always. Do liberals ever accept personal responsibility? Of course not.
Obama kinda sucks now.
I dont like to hear about the fact that I dont have money to spend... but that doesnt mean I can just keep spending. 
Does this guy never stop campaigning? Everything he says is overwrought rhetoric and everything he does is a photo op. 
Not sure anyone cares what President ShamWow wants to hear.
A democrat doesnt want to listen to the idea of spending cuts? Shocking. Absolutely shocking. 
"His logic is way off. We *couldnt* afford the government shutdown, and we *cant* afford all of this spending."
Dont tell me I cant appoint financial meltdown advisors to cabinet positions and prolong military efforts my initital election campaign preached against. 
LOL has he been reduced to Will Someone PLEASE think of the children?
As if those are the only two choices. 
People still believe a word this guy sputters out his pie hole?
This guy must advocate the Military Industrial Complex
Why is this news? Hes gonna say nice shit. Post when he actually does something.
I agree with him 100 percent. But I think this is just 100 percent bullshit pandering. Wasted breathes. 
"&gt;You mean because that would actually be outrageous? Yes, it would be outrageous, but just as outrageous as BET. &gt;[rant about congress] Red herring. The balance in Politics has nothing to do with education, but political power of a group. I am part of a minority as well (not race) and my group is also not represented by % that matches the population of the country. Also, we have the most diverse congress in history. I have a cousin that is white and he grew up in a very poor neighborhood in the city and most of his neighbors are black. From birth to graduation of high school, he had the EXACT same opportunities as his neighbors (which arent great). My cousin didnt get special treatment to get into college but his neighbors could, all because of the color of their skin. If we want to grant special access to a group of people, it should be based on family income, NOT the color of the skin. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/01/03/new-congress-is-most-diverse-in-history/"
"Im always so mystified by people who make such absurd assumptions about affirmative action and racism. 1. Affirmative action is not a free job or a free admission to a college. Race and gender are considerations and businesses are encouraged to take affirmative action to remedy their past discrimination with inclusion with programs largely of their own design. 2. The majority of the recipients of affirmative action are [white women.]( http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/17/affirmative-action-has-helped-white-women-more-than-anyone/) 3. There is and always has been affirmative action for white males; its called legacy admissions. [Interesting, no?](http://www.businessinsider.com/legacy-kids-have-an-admissions-advantage-2013-6) 4. The notion that the US is a meritocracy absent affirmative action displays supreme ignorance about discrimination throughout history and in the present. 5. Besides the fact that Income based admissions would ignore non income related hardships specific groups face with regard to college admissions; there is a critical difference between wealth and income. In 2003, blacks had about 10% of the wealth that whites have and it has only gotten worse since the crash. [See?](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/24/donna-brazile/brazile-said-53-percent-black-wealth-has-disappear/) 6. The notion that black people are more racist in an environment in which they have an extraordinary limited amount of political power and influence over the white majority is embarrassing and indicative of a refusal to acknowledge power in discussions of racism. White people have it. Black people do not. Large swaths of black people may be prejudiced, but prejudiced aint racist. "

"He should be eligible. I mean, I *hope* he is, and not just for the predictable entertainment value. If hes eligible, my brother is probably eligible. While, hes not a politician, the idea that he could run is just mind-boggling from the perspective of a Canadian with a Green Card. And seeing how popular Ted Cruz *isnt*, my no-name brother could possibly run against him in 2016 and win so long as he had enough money for campaigning."
hes not eligible to run for president unless we change the constitution. Thank goodness.
how about addressing the first question then
"And that is relevant to THIS how? also, source?"
so does that make it okay since they all do it?

That Congressman and the General aw supposedly long time friends. It was reportedly an ill-advised attempt to give some good natured ribbing to an old friend.

"...or vote yourself a salary increase, for that matter? While were at it, how is for profit health insurance not a conflict of interest? You got me started...grrrr ;-x"
"vote yourself a salary increase? But Congress doesn?t do that now. Under current law, pay increases are determined by a cost-of-living formula, and they take effect automatically, unless Congress votes to stop them. And in fact, that?s what has happened for the past two years. Congress denied itself any pay raise in 2010 and in 2011. http://www.factcheck.org/2010/05/another-zero-pay-increase-for-congress/"
These are honest questions...Why is it that supposedly curious people like yourself dont ever ask why the right wing media fails to challenge Republicans to prove that these laws are needed in the first place? Why do you think people who would be negatively impacted by the law should be forced to explain themselves but those who want to change the way weve been voting for decades arent required to explain their logic and reasoning? Thanks.
I am sorry. I do not have a TV so I do not know what the right wing media is saying at all. I also do not think that people should have to explain themselves. I think you may have confused me with someone else. My questions where honest ones because I did not read the link and wanted someone to explain it to me.
Why challenge Republicans? Its not just Republicans passing the rules. http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/03/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-rhode-islands-voter-identificatio/ And as far as early voting ... there are blue states with the same voting hours/days/rules as some of the red states are trying to pass... but no ones complaining about the blue states. http://www.270towin.com/early-voting-2012-election/ 
Sorry for jumping to conclusions. But my question was an honest one. 
"Thats a bad article and a misleading number. For one, that wasnt given to him when he left Halliburton -- thats all the money he earned working as CEO of Halliburton. It was spread out over five years (at least for the stock options and such, which are designed to be paid out at a later date.) I dont think its unreasonable to assume that a CEO of a large corporation could earn $5-6 million per year in stock options. /r/politics has stories all the time about how the average compensation of the top 100 CEOs is over $15 million per year. Im sure much of these things (such as the stock options) were decided when he signed on with the company -- long before he was chosen as Bushs running mate. Things like his salary and deferred compensation *definitely* have nothing to do with him leaving. &gt; Many of the other categories were subject to some calculation and/or negotiation Where does Politifact get its information that these were negotiated bonuses given to Cheney when he left his CEO position? It seems much more likely that Cheney had these stock options as part of his original contract -- half a decade before he ran for Vice President. To be honest, Im not a huge fan of Politifact. They tend to not be as unbiased as FactCheck.org. Theyre not terrible, but this article is an example of where theyre not too great. Implying that things like deferred compensation are an exit bonus is just plain wrong. Their entire calculation rests on this assumption, yet they provide no evidence or even reasoning behind this assumption:"
"Fact check: **FALSE.** Dick Cheney did *NOT* profit handsomely and directly from the Iraq war. Before he entered office, he assigned all of his stock options to charity and purchased an insurance policy to guarantee his deferred compensation. He didnt stand to gain or lose *a single penny* based on Haliburtons performance. Not one cent. http://www.factcheck.org/kerry_ad_falsely_accuses_cheney_on_halliburton.html &gt;**Summary** &gt;A Kerry ad implies Cheney has a financial interest in Halliburton and is profiting from the companys contracts in Iraq. The fact is, Cheney doesnt gain a penny from Halliburtons contracts, and almost certainly wont lose even if Halliburton goes bankrupt. - - &gt;**Stock Options** &gt;That still would leave the possibility that Cheney could profit from his Halliburton stock options if the companys stock rises in value. However, Cheney and his wife Lynne have assigned any future profits from their stock options in Halliburton and several other companies to charity. And were not just taking the Cheneys word for this -- we asked for a copy of the legal agreement they signed, which we post here publicly for the first time. &gt;The Gift Trust Agreement the Cheneys signed two days before he took office turns over power of attorney to a trust administrator to sell the options at some future time and to give the after-tax profits to three charities. The agreement specifies that 40% will go to the University of Wyoming (Cheneys home state), 40% will go to George Washington Universitys medical faculty to be used for tax-exempt charitable purposes, and 20% will go to Capital Partners for Education, a charity that provides financial aid for low-income students in Washington, DC to attend private and religious schools. &gt;The agreement states that it is irrevocable and may not be terminated, waived or amended, so the Cheneys cant take back their options later."
"The only thing I could find on that is a bunch of sites (actually, leftist sites) saying that Cheneys lawyer says Cheney wont seek any tax benefits from his donation. I have no reason to doubt that, since he also went out of his way to purchase an insurance policy out of his own pocket so that even if Halliburton went bankrupt he wouldnt stand to lose anything. Plus, its worth noting, none of this was legally required of Cheney. He did it on his own. Its not like he was just following protocol; he went above and beyond (costing him tens of thousands for the insurance policy and millions in potential profits) to remove his ties to a number of large businesses (not just Halliburton)."
"So it looks like he didnt stand to lose anything if Halliburton failed, but he sure was able to gain the satisfaction of helping those he wanted at the expense if those he didnt."
"So, why not just sell those options? It also leaves open the possibility that, while not profiting personally, he was doing favours for friends within Halliburton. Those could have been friends to whom he already owed favours or people from whom he expected or hoped to receive some return favours in kind later. Im willing to be proved wrong but the extensive use of no-bid, cost-plus contracts looks a hell of a lot like a vehicle for corruption and Ive yet to see an explanation for them that makes better sense than that thats what they were."
But he did get $34 million when he left Halliburton. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/24/chris-matthews/chris-matthews-says-cheney-got-34-million-payday-h/
"Wow! I was wrong! Does his charitable giving have an impact on his taxes? If the value of his options go up, does he get more tax benefit? Anyway, I wont be repeating that again, since I consider Fact Check to be a reputable source. Thank you for correcting me."
"What do you call a tax system where wealthy pay a smaller percent than those who earn significantly less? [If you care to educate yourself, with citations...](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/12/timothy-geithner/geithner-says-top-1-percent-have-tax-rate-low-20s/)"
"&gt; Our current tax system is regressive, in favor of those sitting on mounds of wealth. Thats simply ***false***."
"Politifact.com is a terrible site. FactCheck.org is the far better site. I really dont care what you say, though. Because the CBO issued a comprehensive report. Its not up for debate -- the rich not only pay more, they pay *disproportionately high* percentages of federal taxes (no, not JUST income tax -- all federal taxes.) http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43373 I know that you really, *really* want to believe that the rich pay less.

"Ill probably get downvoted to hell for bringing this up in an /r/politics thread about eliminating tax breaks but these oil companies already pay easily over 40% of what they make in taxes. Their tax rate is among the highest, but the oil industry is always brought up before any other industry. It doesnt make much sense. Every company gets some tax breaks, why not focus on those that only pay a small percentage of their revenue in taxes? Source: http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2012/04/16/which-megacorps-pay-megataxes/"
More like Obama wants to say things that sound good to Democrats 
It wont happen. The Republicans always take care of their rich buddies. Same shit every year.
"I feel like oil subsidies are a left wing talking point that bears little understanding of their influence on the industry. Here in Canada, those kinds of subsidies are used to make the industry more environmentally sustainable. Forcing companies to compete with one another for these tax breaks to make the industry cleaner seems like a better way to go than outright elimination."
Ill take things thatll never happen for $1000 Trebek.
This sucks but needs to happen. When it does happen the oil barons will just pass their losses off on to us unfortunately.
Obama is just telling the people what they want to hear. Its been his MO his entire career. 
"When I see headlines like this I think to myself, LOL, and carry about my day. I deserve to be downvoted, I have nothing to contribute here."
"No he doesnt. This is nothing more than a symbolic gesture that scores some cheap political points. Obama knows that congress will never send a bill like this to him for signature so he is free to lie about his actual stance as much as he wants without any major consequences. He admitted that he engages in this type of strategy and action when explaining why he voted not to increase the debt ceiling as a senator. Since he knew his vote didnt matter, he just did whatever the fuck got him the most political support as opposed to voting based on what he actually thought was the best decision for the country."
"Exxon Mobils profit margin is roughly 8%. In contrast, Googles margin is 20%, Apples is 23%, GEs is 13%, Berkshire Hathaways is 12%. They make billions of dollars because they are a 400 billion dollar company..."
"Serious: If they do that, wont that just cause the oil companies to further increase our (the consumer) costs?"
Forward thinking energy policy in America? SHUT IT DOWN! SHUT IT DOWN NOW! 
Well see if this actually happens
This article loses all credibility as it interchanges tax breaks with subsidy as if there were analogous. When your bad syntax reflects no understanding of Macro Economics 101 then you are not a serious article. You are a propaganda piece. You are OBrien in a hijacked limo. 
The amount of tax subsidies ($4 billion) comes out to about $0.03 per gallon. So no need to get all huffy with how the cost of oil will skyrocket
http://cleantechnica.com/2014/03/13/obama-wants-eliminate-tax-breaks-oil-companies/ Obama wants to eliminate tax breaks for oil companies 
"This article would be a lot more informative if it pointed to the actual tax breaks in question, or is this similar to when Obama claimed Romeny was avoiding taxes because much of his payable taxes fell under capital gains?"
"?Contrary to popular belief, these tax proposals do not target ?Big Oil,? but instead go after 18,000 American independent oil and natural gas producers, who on average employ only 12 workers. American production activities are dominated by these independent producers who drill 95 percent of the nation?s natural gas and oil wells, accounting for 67% of total U.S. natural gas and oil production. America?s independents are dedicated to finding and producing America?s energy resources, creating jobs, generating revenues and supplying reliable and affordable energy all across the United States. [Source](http://energytaxfacts.com/assets/uploads/2013/02/IPAA-Tax-Statement_4-26-11.pdf?6a1688) "
Its easy for him to say that because he knows that congress wont do a fucking thing about it. When the democrats had total control of congress...did they get rid of them then? Fuck no. Im still pissed about that. 
"First off, oil companies already pay an EXTREME amount of taxes before their profits are made. Even though oil companies do well, they sure as hell pay a shit load to every governmnet that is involved, sometimes before drilling begins. Governments do take advantage of this. A lot of the times too much. "
"Oil companies are going to destroy this entire planet, happily, eagerly, amorally, and the rest of the world will have to watch as their communities are violated, their drinking water is contaminated, their quality of life is deteriorated, all for a few dollars. Ive begun to feel like, if youre not living poor, youre not living right."
This is like the 4th or 5th time he had said this.. 
"Carry on people. Nothing to see here. &gt; Every year around tax season, President Obama asks that the taxpayer subsidies that go to oil and gas companies be repealed. &gt; Unfortunately, these annual proposals are mostly symbolic in nature."
"Maybe not a comment for politics but, Isnt the us in trouble because of a really really big debt?"
It would probably be easier and more effective to enact massive campaign finance reform and limits on corporate personhood. And Obama knows this.
"Never happens cause of the straw man scare. They raise gas prices to $11 a gallon! What mother of 10, staying home to raise her family can afford that?"
[Id believe it if this wasnt the case..](http://rlv.zcache.ca/obama_liar_in_chief_bumper_stickers-raeb089b658b044fa86970a7f8e4faf3d_v9wht_8byvr_324.jpg)
He wont kill the golden goose...too much of a pussy for that!
Obama says a lot of stuff. Does he do any of it? No.
Didnt he give them tax breaks along with Bush?
"Are people actually reading the whole article or just the headline? The author is correct, this is mostly symbolic and Obama doesnt have the power (or perhaps even the genuine desire) to get this done. Congress would have to eliminate these subsidies. And its very unlikely with lobbying like [this](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=E01) going on."
"&gt; Every year around tax season, President Obama asks that the taxpayer subsidies that go to oil and gas companies be repealed. The logic being that since these companies are making record-breaking profits, they don?t need subsidies. That sounds logical. yeah, that is almost too logical..."
Says he wants to. Remember Obama has been proven time and time again he is a complete liar.
Why do companies have breaks from paying taxes in the first place at all?
"dear god! i work in O&amp;G in houston. im already exposed to enough Fox News shit at work, now itll be totally unbearable..."
What are the chances this will happen? How hard will the oil companies lobby and bribe?
Get rid of all energy subsidiaries let energy cost what it cost. 
"Are there any beneficial government subsidies/tax breaks? It seems to me like farm subsidies are a very similar kind of problem, am I totally wrong about that?"
ITT: nobody who understands economics.
AWESOME NEWS! Now we just need congress to come up with the proposal.......oh.
Instead the US gov will allow the CIA (or a similar private sector contractor) to destabilize and overthrow an oil/natural gas rich democracy of their choice. Act now and theyll even install a free puppet government.
"OK, I agree that oil subsidies need to go, and I had a lengthy debate with a friend of mine. He says that half of the subsidies attributed to oil companies is actually money that goes to low income families to help pay utility bills. Does anyone know if this is true??"
"As a fiscal conservative, I thoroughly approve of this idea, along with ending tax breaks for every other company. "
Brilliant! Watch the price of petroleum products skyrocket.
There are better ways to boost the economy then artificially bringing down the price of gas.
Not obamas biggest fan but these sort of steps are absolutely crucial to the future of our country/the entire world. Really happy they are trying.
How about we *start* with the oil companies?
hopefully he WILL eliminate the tax breaks for oil corps. big difference between wants to and will eliminate
"If only.... *sigh*.... The fact that were still dependent on oil and coal renders this nearly impossible. Until we can extricate ourselves from fossil fuels and find a cheaper and more reliable energy source the minions of Satan that run these companies will continue to win every battle- including this one. Either way, good luck...."
John Stewarts take on this was great (food stamps vs. Oil subsidies) and Fox news. 2 parts http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-march-13-2014/fox-news-welfare-academy http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-march-13-2014/2014--a-waste-odyssey
"Obama said the same things in 2007, 2008 and 2009...nothing happened"
Why the fuck would an oil company get a tax break in the first place?
"Lots of talk, not so much action. Just keep using those executive orders. Oh and Im glad they receive such big tax breaks when they continuously have hiked the prices of oil and product subsidiaries without cause and created false demands by cutting back production while still enjoying record profits year over year. "

YAY! ITS ABOUT TIME!!!

"Obamas wanted to do a lot since we first met him. Lets see him actually get done what he says hes going to. Not a version of it, fuckkng do it. Im so tired of his promises and thoughts, fucking do it or at least FIGHT for it. "
I dont see anyway this happens. i feel like he does this song and dance every year. 
"Not that Im against taking away tax breaks oil companies, but wont this just give them reason to collectively raise their prices, thereby costing the consumer more at the end? I just dont think that the taxpayers or the oil consumers should have to pay more in all of this, I just dont see a way that the oil companies will be paying the difference themselves without pushing the costs to someone else. "
Yeah he said this in 2008 too. If you believed him then youre probably stupid enough to believe him now.
yawn
"Its not Obamas call, and the House wont vote for it so this is pretty much non-news."
"Is there anything to stop them from just jacking up there prices if they lose their tax breaks? This just makes me think of whenever the cable companies get a new tax or have to pay a new licensing fee, they fight it tooth and nail but then just pass on the cost to their customers."
"What is good for the syndicate is good for the country and remember, everyone has a share. "
One tax rate for all taxed entities including individuals! Alright... now somebody tell me whats wrong with that idea...
"In other news, not going to happen. "
Yes please.
"No need to, they will turn from oil companies to gas companies and still get tax brakes. "
This is unamerican.

"The only reason that man hasnt been shot is because we live in a so-called information age, where character assassination is more efficient than its literal alternative."
"Gas is extremely expensive and its virtuously impossible to decide fuck gas, I aint buying that shit anymore. Theres no reasonable alternative for most people. Anyone know why any politician would be against getting rid of tax breaks for oil companies? Practical reasons, not because of oil lobbyists/money/etc."
annnd assassination in 3.. 2..
And soon to be passed on to the consumer.
"Obama wants to do this *now*, since taxpayers have footed a good bit of the tab for the BP oil spill and have long forgotten about it. Political cronies first, ideology second."
"Does he want to, or is he just saying he wants to? Last time I recall, he also wanted to do [all of the following](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-broken/) -- [Here is a list of promises that he has kept](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-kept/) so that I dont appear to be biased. When the fuck are people going to realize what politicians say has absolutely nothing to do with what they actually do."
Good ole deducting business expenses = tax breaks line
"I think they need the subsidies, because how else would anybody be incentivised to drill for oil?"
"Of course he does. Down with capitalism! Instead of saving large companies tons of money so they can hire more people &amp; grow, lets give the government more money that they cant seem to figure out how to spend correctly in the first place."
Obama *says* he wants to eliminate tax breaks - that doesnt mean he actually wants to. There is often a huge gap between what he says and does. 
He keeps saying things like this but nothing ever happens. 
Thanks Obama
"And the oil companies will pass these taxes off to us. You are delirious if you think they dont already artificially increase the cost of gas for profits. Yes the current **market** price will increase by $.03 a gallon, but those fucks at BP surely will raise it much much higher then that."
how about eliminating tax breaks for bogus clean energy companies that fail.
[deleted]
His security better be on their toes.
"How about eliminating the goddamn income tax, and covering the gap in tax revenue with the profits from oil companies? "
"Thats a nice safe thing to say that people can rally behind yeah why do they get tax breaks, bullshit! Why do I think is safe to say? Well because they will remain to have those breaks. Think about how much taxes they will actually have to pay vs. how much it will cost them to lobby not to pay those taxes. It is a scam. "
"Just like Bush ushered in a bunch of tax breaks for the rich right before leaving his second term in office, Obama will usher in a bunch of cancellations of said tax breaks before leaving office for the second time."
Good.
"Just like he wants to close guantanamo, and wants to legalize pot, and wants to stop all those nasty wars, and wants gay people to get married. Hes a proven liar, and will say anything to stay even remotely popular, just like all politicians."
"This isnt the kind of hope and change we were anticipating. If tax breaks are eliminated for our industry, are you the consumer ready to pay almost twice as much per gallon of petrol? Your government artificially deflates the apparent cost of gas by a tremendous amount, thats a big part of why fuel is so much less expensive over there than most of the rest of the world. We wont pay an extra cent, the cost will be passed to you. This is not a tax break for us, it was a tax break for you and everyone you know who purchases our product. We *want* to give you what you seek for the price youre able to pay, but we have a fiduciary duty to generate a specific profit and assure you that this change will not affect that final figure for our stockholders."
Effective Translation: Obama wants you to pay more for gas.
How about you stop the wars and defund the NSA first?
"Stopping oil companies from getting tax breaks seems as likely as North Korea launching nukes and becoming Emperor of the Universe as a result. The more money a company has, the more influence it will use to manipulate things into its favour. Someone somewhere took a huge bribe and got something past into law which will make those with the most money untouchable behind the great wall of lawyers they have."
"Personally, I think the oil companies should be nationalized...and their executives arrested for corruption and bribery, and all their assets seized. Those bastards have ripped us off too much, for too long. Warmongering, corruption, rip offs, lies, environmental degradation...and now the ice caps are melting, faster and faster...threatening the whole planet. Arrest their jive ass, and seize their assets...they are traitors to humanity! "
Obama wants to eat a cheese sandwich
Then we should all be prepared for the oil companies to pass that on to us the consumer. 5-6 dollars a gallon here we come!
Theyll just pass the expense on to us. 
of course he does. right after he stops NSA from spying on us all.
Big Business - END GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN BUSINESS! Obama - K. Cool. Ill just be repealing those gajillion dollar subsidies to oil. Big Business - WAIT. Can we just talk this one out?
"Alright then, do it. You wont"
[MRW reading this](http://imgur.com/r/reactiongifs/qHBf6)
Wake me up when Obama does something he says he wants to do. Im tired of the rhetoric.
Yet another token gesture at treating a symptom of systemic failure. Until you change the fact that congress is little more than a mess of corporate and private interest sponsorship well continue to live in an oligarchy that sacrifices citizens and environment for bottom lines. I am increasingly certain that its a lost cause.

BREAKING NEWS!! Obama killing in car accident... tomorrows headline.
"The relevant bit : &gt; Unfortunately, these annual proposals are mostly symbolic in nature. Congress is responsible for writing and passing government spending bills, not the President. Although, Obama could certainly put pressure on parties involved. He hasnt done that, and I think this is telling. Politicians have been known to say things that appeal to their base without being substantive or truthful in nature (shocking, I know)."
Gas prices are going to skyrocket I guarantee it
"Oil companies will simply raise their prices because they will feel the need to sustain a certain level of profit. Look at big universities with endowments, they could charge less, but lower profits shows weakness. "
This might as well say Obama wants to give everyone free ice cream. It doesnt matter what Obama wants. The rest if the government enriching themselves on bribes from the oil companies wont let this fly.
good
I also heard the Obama administration was going to hold the bankers accountable for destroying the economy in 2008...haha just kidding. 
How is this news? Hes been pushing this for years.
"Hah. No he doesnt. He just says he does. But, big oil lines his pockets just as much as every other politician. Theres a reason these things never go anywhere. "
That guy sure wants to do a lot of stuff. 
Yea but it never happens.
He can want what he wants all day. This still has about 0% chance of happening.
"Thanks, Obama."
"This is just his way of looking like a hero. Nothing will come of this, I guarantee it."
Must be an election year. 
Wants. 
Wants to... 
"I support eliminating most or all of the preferential tax breaks for oil companies, if only to help new renewable technologies that are disadvantaged because dirty technologies get to damage the environment for free, but everyone needs to understand that in the short run, this does not hurt oil companies, this only hurts consumers. Almost the entire incidence of higher taxes on oil companies will be passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices, rather than being absorbed by the energy companies as lower profits. This is because tax incidence depends on the Price Elasticity of Demand. Price Elasticity of Demand is the economics term to describe how consumers change their purchasing quantity in response to a change in price. In other words, with most products as price goes up you would expect consumers to forgo the product, use less of it, and/or find alternatives, so quantity demanded would go down. In goods with very comparable alternatives, if price went up you would expect quantity demanded to fall off a cliff. For example, if the price of yellow onions starts to go up you would expect people to switch their purchasing to white onions because theyre not so much different that people are always willing to pay a huge premium for a yellow onion over a white. Energy like gasoline is the opposite of yellow onions: demand is almost completely inelastic in the short run. As price goes up, people still have to keep buying roughly the same amount. They can try to avoid driving to some degree, they can try carpooling, but in the end they have to get to work, drive their kids to school, run errands, do everything else, and theres nothing they can really do in the near term about fuel costs. Maybe in 5 years they can buy a new car that prioritizes fuel economy. So with gasoline, because demand is inelastic, the vast majority of the tax increases are borne by the end consumer. Oil companies will continue to be as profitable as ever. This is in the short run. After implementing a policy of higher taxes on energy we would expect people in the market for new cars to immediately begin placing higher priority on better fuel economy, and as they shop for houses to pick ones closer to their work and maybe with public transport options, etc. In the long run demand elasticity can increase, but that can take 10+ years as people have to wait until its time to buy new cars and move houses."
"this is a really shit article. i mean, really shit."
Again? Obama quite literally promises this every year. 
"Yeah, Obama wants to do a lot of things."
"Go to it Obama, get it done. "
How did the oil lobby even let Obama say such a thing!? Hes going rogue... Is he *trying* to get shot!?
/r/nevergoingtohappen
Fucking do.it already. Bs
No shit
Yeah and are those GOP clowns gonna get on board?
"If he was serious, hed be dead. "
I feel like this would only increase energy costs for consumers.
Someone looking for troubles!
"I support eliminating most, if not all, tax breaks for private companies. If youre going to increase taxes on oil companies, dont then give that additional money to alternative energy companies. Let the two industries compete without showing favoritism. "
Obama want to leave on good terms with the people does he? Politics..
At the same time they need to eliminate tax breaks for churches/ religions.
End all corporate welfare and subsidies. Its that simple. 
Remy Danton will not be pleased
"Whats the point of this? Increased tax revenue? Oil companies operate on razor thin profit margins, and oil runs the economy."
How about eliminating tax breaks for government employees too?
"Obamas way of saying Sorry guys, Im spending too much money. Gotta raise taxes! Stop giving free rides to people and you wont have a budget problem. Its a federal government, not a fucking daycare."
You tax the oil companies they will tax our ass
churches too.. make churches pay taxes!
They will just pass it on to the consumer. Gas prices are already rising.
Good idea I want to pay more for my gas.
The reason this wont pass is because he wants to take that money and specifically earmark it for alternative energy companies. I really dont think we can afford another $500 million toilet flush like Solyndra.
[Yeah...](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Jennifer-Lawrence-ok-thumbs-up.gif)
Everyone realizes the companies will just increase their prices to make up for the lost tax break revenue? 
Wait. Is that Communism?
"I agree. Instead, put that money into alternative energy investments. If you want to subsidize something, subsidize electric vehicles or hybrids that cost less than 50k. Subsidize solar energy panel installation. "
Election year move to motivate the Democratic base. No chance of passing - will anger anyone who remembers Solyndra and will lead to gas price (and overall commodity price) increases in the short term if passed. Political poison. 
"Thats cool that he wants to. But will he? Nope. Also, gas prices will rise as a result and then people will complain."
"To put it in perspective, this $4 billion is larger than the entire US food stamp program that Republicans have been relentlessly attacking. Jon Stewart had [major fun](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-trashes-fox-and-eric-bolling-for-food-stamp-hypocrisy/) with this last night."
"But if we get rid of their tax breaks, theyll have less money to invest in lobbyists to fight for tax breaks. This will hurt lobbyist *jobs*. Ah, who am i kidding. Theyll just raise prices and make up the difference that way."
"Exxon, Shell, and Cheveron are all in the top 10 (or was it top 5?) most ***profitable*** companies in the world... i never understood why they got so many tax breaks to begin with"
*America... I want to... Eliminate... Tax breaks... For Oil Companies... but... I wont*
Wants to and actually doing it are totally different. Its sad that Washington is so scared of big oil. 
The day this happens is the day I become a fucking king.
"As an Obama hater, I cant be more behind him on this on."
"They should tax them at 100%, there is no reason they should be making any profit at all!"
Obama already had $4 - $6 / gallon gas prices... why not shoot for it again!
"So, can we get to Churchs paying taxes?"
"I used to be on the side that wanted Welfare heavily controlled, and cut, etc, until i found out how much money is given out to companies of this magnitude. Its ridiculous and long over due. I doubt it will happen though, as they funnel more money and influence to politicians than anyone else of the 99% can muster though. "
Can we stop with the roundabout terminology? Why not: Obama wants to tax oil companies again.
Hahaha fat chance getting that done lol
And theyll pass the savings on to YOUUUU
Wouldnt this just make oil more expensive ergo making gas and all our everyday products more expensive?
"And I want to fuck Halle Berry, but we know neither of those things are going to happen."
Is it an election year already?
"HA HA. Yeah right. Grandstanding, and nothing more. Thanks! Sincerely, Big Oil."
Wont they raise gas prices if this occurs?
" Congratulations [u/penguincheerleader](http://reddit.com/u/penguincheerleader), This is now the top post on reddit! You can see all the top posts at [r/topofreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/topofreddit/new/)"
"Obama should also send a SEAL Team after the fuckity Wall Street energy speculators, who are in bed with the oil/refiners industries, and are keeping pump prices artificially high."
"Yeah, Im conservative and even I dont think they deserve tax breaks. Go ahead Obama. You have my permission."
"I know everyone here gets a raging hard on when they hear that tax cuts to big corporations might be repealed. But the problem is that big corporations dont get to be big corporations by simply accepting lower revenues. Do you think oil companies would just say Well shit. Were not going to make as much money this year!? ...because that wouldnt happen. They would just find somewhere else to make it up. And know OIL companies in particular, their favorite method is to pass it on to the consumer +20%. So in other words, if it costs the oil company 30 more cents per gallon, they just raise the price of gas by 30 cents + another 20% because now they can hang it around the governments neck. They will feed into the narrative that these hippy liberals and their green initiatives are killing the economy. But the bottom line is the same. We the consumers will get fucked. Thats probably why they never go through with these cuts."
"Heres the thing... No matter what tax is being implemented, somebody is going to disagree. There are three basic tax methods: progressive, regressive, and flat. Lower/Middle class usually favor progressive taxes because the more money earned, the higher the tax percentage. Regressive taxes tend to be favored by the richer as taxes percentages, you guessed it, regress as they earn more money. Flat tax is like sales tax, a percentage thats not based on class. Looking at income taxes overall (its been a while), the top 10% is paying ~70% of all the money collected and is earning ~40% of all money. Take that for what its worth... Thats all Im sayin"
eliminate tax breaks means were going to raise taxes on everyone to try to fix this when in fact it will stay the same and we will pay more.
Take it from the oil company and give it to renewable energy. Time to stop helping the rich to get richer and start to think about the future.
"Thats nice, let me know when he actually does it."
I think the point about essentially reallocating the money to alternative energy research is much more exciting.
"Ill believe it when I see it. He has wanted, promised or alluded to lots of change. "
"I wonder if this would adversely affect the cost of certain pharmaceuticals and other, non-gasoline petroleum products?"
Pretty sure they would straight up fund having him killed.
Obama wants to do a lot of things. Does he do them?
I want to eliminate payroll taxes
"If they didnt own Congress, this would be great news, but the President and I are actually on equal footing here. We both have the same stance on this issue, and are both powerless to change anything relating to it."
Ha ha funny joke
Im starting to like this Obama guy. Cant wait to vote for him in the next election. 
"Im fine with rolling back corporate tax breaks, but doing so only for one industry seems a little underhanded. Better to eliminate corporate traces, and raise taxes on individuals. Salaries go up, and equality does to if you raise the top rates much higher. Also, all investment income gets treated as regular income."
Theres a difference between wants to and will.
"I wish I got these tax breaks, my tax rate is 39.6% and I have to pay both myself and my wifes SS tax up until 115k then medicare for 3% and a new $10,000 bonus tax for Obamacare ON TOP of the 10K I already pay for healthcare for my family. wtf? small businesses should get these breaks not these shitheads."
"Im not a big fan of corporate welfare, but it depends. Some tax breaks are incentives to do things they wouldnt do otherwise, and are not horrible. Lumping all tax breaks into one category isnt really accurate. Anyone know what the actual percentage profit is? Exxon is a gigantic company, so a 1% profit is a lot of money in absolute terms, but not much in percentage. And these oil companies are mostly publicly traded, are they not? So that profit is partially going out to a lot of normal peoples pension plans, retirement accounts, stuff like that. But that said, giving free money to a big company for no particular reason other than that they lobbied for it is certainly NOT good government."
Wants to and will are two different things. 
"I work for a major integrated oil company that had about $250 billion in annual revenue last year, with $27 billion in income and $17 billion in taxes paid. Thanks about a 43% effective tax rate or over $47 million in taxes paid every single day. And Obama wants us to pay more taxes?!"
"Remember ladies and gentleman, shit rolls down hill. "
"Late getting in this post, but here goes. This makes a good headline but does not tell the whole story. You would have to look at each tax break to see if it is simply to benefit the oil company. Take the marginal well tax break for example. Without the tax break, it might be unprofitable to operate that well. The government has decided that marginal wells are important to keep producing and thus provide the tax break to encourage oil companies to keep those wells producing. Otherwise, the oil company would abandon and plug the well. Once abandoned and plugged, you simply do not flip a switch to start the well producing again. So, there is some justification and good policy reasons for the tax breaks. I am not saying that all oil tax breaks should be kept, but you cannot make a blanket statement that they should be eliminated in full."
goddamit stop saying stuff and go do it! GO.
Great! Now lets move on to taxing churches.
Why the fuck are we still using oil? 
Ahhhh. More election year theatrics.
Sounds like we need to bring Obama some freedom. 
"An excuse to hike gas prices, go for it. "
Cue oil companies threatening with armageddon in gas prices if their ridiculous profits are cut.
Raymond Tusk is gonna be furious 
Why eliminate the tax breaks? Why not just give the tax breaks to everyone. That would be fair too.
Yeah thats going to happen. /s
"Fucking great, grand, I would love this- eliminate all subsidies. But really at this point, its an empty want/promise that I have no expectations of being fulfilled."
"1000% pure rhetoric on Obamas part. If this was something he wanted done, and had *any real intent on doing*, he would expend an ounce of energy/political capital and make it happen. When you see [name of president] wants something, the statement is vacuous and purely progagandistic."
"And I want a pony, but itll never happen with this congress."
"But then theyll have to stop producing oil forever. As you know, oil production is very unprofitable. "
good guy walmart?
"Yeah. Okay. Sure. When Politifact does their thing, Ill pay attention."
"Lets eliminate govt incentives for the most critical aspect of the economy, which underpins all other components of the economy from transportation (of goods, people, everything) to energy to heat to plastics to the military to electricity to, well, everything. What could possibly go wrong?"
I read this as Obama wants more Lobbyist Money from the Oil Industry
"I mean, if you tax big companies, wont they just push those prices onto the consumer?"
"There arent any specific oil company tax breaks. You would have to remove the tax breaks from the entire industry (energy producers), not just the guys you dont like. Since there are hundreds of small oil companies, it will wipe out a lot of small business."
What would it take for something like this to pass?
spoiler alert: he wont 
Finally a policy of Obamas that I can agree with. Oil companies should not have tax breaks. They pollute our planet and reap massive profits every year.
These types of things sound great in theory on the surface
how about we stop invading the middle east and giving no bid contracts to oil drillers?
Bullshit. Obamas just too much of a pussy to veto any bill that doesnt come with these tax breaks nullified. He could easily pass the blame of the resulting fallout on to those that wont cut these tax breaks. Hes just playing the crowd by pretending to want to cut these tax breaks. Hed probably shit his pants and veto it if the tax breaks were actually somehow magically cut.
"This again? Please. We did this in california. Guess what happened? Our shitty legislature changed it to a tax at the pump instead, and all our fucking gas prices went up. Fuck this political rhetoric. Want real change? Stop voting for these fucking morons and start voting libertarian. I dont care if it wont work, lets try it."
In other news: The sun is hot.
He looks like hes covered in oil. Also racist: they will tar and feather him Ty
So Obama wants to restrict oil companies from subtracting expenses from their revenue when calculating profit? How is this fair?
"lol right he wants to eliminate tax breaks for the very same oil companies which he gave carte blanche to begin offshore drilling mere weeks before the deep water horizon incident. he wants to, but (wait for it lol) those evil old republicans!? just wont let him lol the kayfabe is getting rather thin and shopworn after 5 years or so"
Bet they raise prices that same day.
"Obama says he wants to do a lot of things , talking about it and doing it are completely different "
"I know reddit is all against any big business at all, but wont this have negative effects? More taxes mean less profits, and Id assume it would lead to higher gas prices. "
"yeah, good luck with that..."
*steps on soapbox and grabs mic* WELCOMMMMMMME ......... TO THE LAST TWO YEARS!!!!
"There shouldnt be any tax breaks for profitable companies. Exxon, Apple, GE, BP, you name them. Once youre off the ground and running, the tax breaks should go away. "
Well its about fucking time.
I cant see this happening. Its the president who takes corporate donations for campaigns versus the oil and gas companies. 
what a nice gesture.... now DO something for once.
If we eliminated from one we should eliminate them from all. Their should be no governmental advantages given to certain businesses. 
But in a few years everyone realizes there is more tax breaks than ever. 
Then just fucking do it...tired of hearing about it year after year.
"What would that really do, though? The oil companies would only raise prices to makeup for the tax breaks and taxpayers would be stuck with higher gas and heating expenses. We lose either way. (Jesus, Im pessimistic)"
"let me know when it happens, kthxbye"
"Thanks, Obama."
President Obama *wants* to do a lot of things...
People in hell want ice water.
Like congress would ever let that happen....lmao!
I see an executive order coming that will shake gas prices 
Tax breaks for small business only...
"if they pay taxes expect prices to increase as well, they never lose"
[deleted]
"Hmm, where have I heard about tax reform and ending tax breaks for ________ before..."
Obama wants to do a lot of things when his approval ratings start to drop.
"You know, at the county level we expect tax breaks to expire eventually. The longest is ten years. How long has the oil industry been getting incentives? "
So our gas will become more expensive? No thanks. Its not like they are going to go; higher taxes? Well just eat the cost. Theyll pass the cost onto the consumer to make up for the increased cost of doing business. 
"Ill take Things That Are Not Going to Happen for $1000, Alex."
GOOD! Now add on eliminating the tax breaks for Unions and married people and well be making actual progress. 
"and I want to eat a fart out of Natalie Portmans asshole, but its probably not gonna happen"
There goes gas prices.
"We already subsidized the theft of $15T of oil in Iraq to the tune of nearly 4,500 American lives and an estimated long-term taxpayer cost of between $2T and $4T. What more do these guys want? The sun, moon, and stars? "
Isnt a little ironic being that oil and gas are subsidized or own by the government in communist states. Then we have the biggest so called socialist dictator in human history trying to cut off said subsidies. 
Socialist! /s
Should be a no brainer. 
sweet now we know if it goes thru then they will just forward the taxes onto the end consumer
Get ready for higher gas prices if this goes through
"Until there is a real sustainable alternative to fossil fuels he should be trying to keep the cost of petroleum products as low as possible. I thought energy independance was one of his priorities. I realize that tax breaks mainly go into executive pockets but raising taxes will not come out of those pockets, it will come out of consumers at which point we will begin to look again to foreign oil."
Good idea fuck oil companies
What is the *real* justification for the breaks? 
Im curious. If the breaks actually end up that they are subsidies--and their elimination means our gas prices will rise by say a buck a gallon--is everyone still against these oil company tax breaks?
Can I get a tax break?
This headline could be from 2007...
And Obama has said a lot that he failed to follow through on or actually fight for after claiming to want to do something.
Great thatll just raise the cost of gasoline...
wants
Probably isnt serious. Midterms are coming up. This seems like a political move so republicans have to come down on the unpopular side of an issue. Pretty standard stuff.
Take all those tax breaks and give more to FARMERS.
Yes.
"He wants to.... He wants to do a lot of things, but never actually does them. The guy is all talk."
"If he does do that, I hope he doubles up on Secret Service spending...lot of people who profit from oil are gonna be just a tad angry about it..."
Its about time. Big government shouldnt pick winners and losers.
"So they should be eliminated. Same for Canada btw. But the US Congress is run by big oil and we will never see it happen. I doubt we will ever see it happen in Canada as well. Yet politicians will cut things to the poor like food stamps etc After all it is a sin to remove subsidies to Big Oil. This just shows the US is a corportist state aka fascist and not a capitalist one, as with capitalism they would get nothing and sink and swim on their own instead of money from tax payers they do not need...(anywhere in the world really)"
"They would never let him, but lets support Obama on this."
And the consumer will pick up the tab.
"Yay, higher gasoline prices! "
"These articles are constantly posted without any reference to what EXACTLY the subsidies/tax breaks are. Is Obama talking about some very slight tax incentives to keep marginal wells producing? If those tax incentives were removed, that would force the premature closure of thousands of wells. Something that could billions in lost tax revenue. Is he talking about LIHEAP, the program that pays for heating oil for poor families? Is he talking about advanced depreciation schedules that authorize oil companies to depreciate the capital value of the well ahead a bit faster than the actual production cycle. An accounting trick that doesnt actually cost the government any tax money over the long term. Taxes deferred now are paid later."
Everyone should pay taxes. Companies should most definitely NOT get tax breaks. I cant even imagine just how twisted this way of politics is worked out.
Yeah not gonna happen. Face it Obama is a lame duck.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS please
THEY DO MAKE RECORD PROFITS EVERY YEAR!
Of course this stands no chance of passing. Not even worth talking about. There is no way it would ever make it through congress.
Does it really matter if these companies get tax breaks or not? If they pay more taxes it will just go to our defense spending. Very little to nothing would go to where its actually needed.
"Yeah, Im guess he wants to eliminate these tax breaks the same way wanted the public the option. That is to say, he doesnt, he just wants to appear to be less conservative than the Republicans."
What Obama wants and what he does are two very different things. 
Obama wanted/wants to do a lot of things. 
Why not just seize the oil companies and make them state owned ? Like what Chavez did in Venezuela. 
why doesnt he make a flat tax and eliminate all tax breaks?
"Id love to see a list of things Obama has *wanted* to do in his presidency, and what hes actually accomplished."
Where did this Obama come from? Maybe these last two years he will go out with a bang. 
Yeah that isnt going to happen. This is more or less Obama trying to win favor with the public.
"Good fucking luck, Mr. President. "
Part of me wants a giant increase in taxes for oil companies just so people learn about rudimentary economics. Similar to hoping your annoying anti-vac friend gets measles. 
Good luck. They have been trying to get rid of this tax break since the 1960s.
This will happen. /s
Kennedy tried this in 1963. It did not end well.
What will Obama do once the oil companies raise the prices on consumers to make up for their lack of tax breaks?
"Yeah, and the pope is Catholic. "
[Good luck.](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01727/BP_1727184c.jpg) 
"You would have to be stupid to not think that they are going to make up the difference by charging us more. In effect, the government is going to get more of our money while oil companies wont be affected all that much."
"Wish in one hand, shit in the other. I wonder which will fill up faster?"
Im curious as to what is being called a subsidy. I cant find anything specific on it. Are they allowing them to write certain expenses off or just flat out lowering rates? Edit: Found something interesting about your 4B$/yr subsides. http://www.forbes.com/sites/energysource/2012/04/25/the-surprising-reason-that-oil-subsidies-persist-even-liberals-love-them/
Raise your hand if you want to pay more for your gas directly or indirectly.
Hes actually been trying to do this for years but it gets blocked by congress every time. 
How about religious tax breaks too?
So that gas will be 8.50 a gallon...
Thats good for him that he wants to. But from the looks of it hes got the same chance of doing it as I do.
I WANT to win a million dollars to.
I WILL NOT STAND FOR CENSORSHIP. FREE SPEECH IS DEAD ON REDDIT.
Lololol just like how Obama wanted to bring the troops home and stop raiding legal cannabis dispensaries that pay their taxes fair and square. 
Make it so!!
"Wont they just put it back onto us anyway? Well foot the bill to make up for it, right?"
another obama gimmick ... trying to ride on popular issues to get what he wants then turns completely around ... remember gitmo? ... typical sleazy politician ... its part of his ongoing campaign to salvage his rotting reputation 
These kinds of things dont work because the companies just charge more for their product. When will we learn? 
who is this and what has he done with barry o
"Hes wanted to do this since he was elected. A lot of politicians want this? no one does anything. Ive been hearing talk of eliminating tax breaks for big oil companies for over a decade? but thats it, just talk of wanting to."
and this will get through the house how? anyways you know this is coming this is why you pay 5 a gallon for gas under obama when it was only A dollar under bush in December 2008 
What a communist!
[deleted]
This guy really is the gift that keeps on giving. And Im not even a Democrat.
"BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!!!!!!! More mumbo jumbo, hot air bullshit from our government. "
"Or, said another way, Obama wants to prevent oil companies from taking many of the same deductions that other companies get to take."
Right. And unicorns will fly out of my ass and cure cancer. 
At this point Im not impressed by anything he wants to do. More action less talk.
Daily Reminder that Gitmo is still open and multiple of Obamas goals are unrealised.
Do you honestly think a company is not going to pass this new cost down to the consumer? Say hello to gas price hikes. 
He promised this in 2008. It was one of the main reasons I voted for him. Hes just NOW getting around to talking about it. I wont hold my breath.
"Obama can want all he wants, its not going to happen. "
Well then DO IT! Stop going on and on and say I want to remove this and this and this and be specific.
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAA
I want my flying pig to wash the dishes.
A lot of this tax subsidy goes towards making it economic to keep stripper wells online. These are wells that only produce a few barrels of oil a year and would otherwise be money losers to operate. There are however many tens of thousands of these wells and if they all went offline it would reduce our domestic production and would be more oil we would have to buy from overseas.
I want to be the queen of england.
What he says and what he actually wants done are two completely different things.
"Whatever he says hes going to do, he does the opposite."
Hed get shot quicker than Kennedy.
"Dude, just get it over with and declare war on the Republicans. These half ass attacks arent getting much done. "
Good. Fuck taxes. 
Never gonna happen.
"This is such a strawman. The companies that actually pay the most taxes (in real dollars, not percentages) are oil companies. You can argue whether they need tax breaks or not, but to be intellectually honest that discussion should be about corporate tax policy as a whole. Not singling out political winners and losers. The biggest beneficiary of oil companies is already the Federal government. The receive billions in revenue from oil companies and billions more from gas taxes. Its not the private sector (or free individuals) fault they cannot effectively spend their money."
"HERE COMES THE CHANGE, EVERYBODY!! Celebrate good Obama, cmon! Its obamabama"
"When companies get hit with heavier taxes, dont they just pass it along to the consumer by raising the sale price to make up for the difference? [Serious]"
"No he doesnt. Like everything else, he just pays lip service to the idea"
"Oh thats a good joke, thanks for the comic relief! "
"If this even were to go into effect, wouldnt it subsequently give oil companies more incentive to charge more per barrel, inevitably causing an influx of the price of everything we use? Im talking about hypotheticals, based on hypotheticals, based on hypotheticals, based on hypotheticals, but is far too possible."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzkS8k5iacw
I know people love this idea but I hope you realize that the title might as well read: Obama wants to raise the price of gasoline.
"But then, corporatist Obama regained his senses."
Want and will are different things
"Obama wants to do a lot of things, the problem is he never accomplishes anything and when he does its a disastrous clusterfuck. "
Thats cute. He thinks well believe itll happen.
The carbon bubble is getting bigger day by day. 
Just like Guantanamo and policies that violate civil rights. Yes we can!
"Great, well at least it will only have a detrimental affect on those who buy gasoline."
Sure he does.
I would be concerned for his safety if there was any chance that would pass. Those people are powerful and they dont like it when you mess with the trough.
thats nice i want to have a million $. i think i have a better chance then him
Obama wants to end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq too...
"And when youre paying $10.00 a gallon, or your bus fare is 6x what it is now, or train fare, and it costs you $3.00 to recharge your phone, remember this moment."
"Yeah, no he doesnt. If he does there is no chance. Nothing to see here this is what we call propaganda. "

And close Gitmo
I dont care what he wantsto do. Let me know what he can and will do. 
Thats a nice way to ask for donations from oil companies.
Is it just me or has there been an influx of right wingers on reddit recently?
Good. Long due. 
SURE he does.
Fuckin a they tax the planet
I agree
Amen!!
Yeah. [Sure](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0510/36783.html) he does. Anyone who believes this rhetoric is a moron.
"about time, damn Exxon and all those other welfare queens"
...to pay for tax breaks he approves. 
"Many of the major gas companies are diversifying into renewable energy sources and getting their tax money there. So dont worry, they will still be sucking on our tits for decades to come. "
"House of Cards, Obama, same shit"
"sounds like more bullshit. fuck the 2 parties, vote independant."
"In the unlikely event that this were to happen, wouldnt that mean gas prices severely going up for all of us? Because those oil companies will want to make their big profits anyway and since they wont be getting the tax breaks they will just hike up the gas prices and get their profits from us regular people who dont get any say in the matter. "
Well looks like gas prices will go up
"Good luck! You try every year, and it goes nowhere. Taking money from businesses and spending it on actual human beings will never work here."
"Yeah, and I want a billion dollars, but it isnt going to happen. Wanting something doesnt equal getting through congress."
If he really did then it would only mean REALLY higher prices for the rest of us at the pump. Companies never eat added expenses of doing business. They pass that cost on to the consumer. 
"The energy (oil) companies have each paid more in taxes than any other corporation from 2007 to 2012: Exxon: $146 billion, effective tax rate 37% Chevron: $85 billion, effective tax rate 39% ConocoPhillips: $58 billion, effective tax rate 74% Are these tax rates unreasonably low? hmm 74%, better raise that 90% and make them pay their fair share. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/25/sunday-review/corporate-taxes.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=3&amp;"

"If you want to eliminate useless tax breaks, start with the NFL!!!!"
"About time that the subsidies were taken away from those fat oil cats, and given to companies trying to produce clean energy. Now the real problem is, finding a new energy source producer that isnt going to abuse or mis-use these new funds. Maybe its best if no company gets these subsidies, at least the oil companies wont have money they dont deserve."
Thanks Obama!
Its about time!
ya okay
"So what, the gas prices at the pump will just go up accordingly!"
LOL fat chance. The oil companies own this government. 
"Something Something, Coal plants are still shutting down. "
Can anyone provide a link to a simple breakdown of what these tax breaks actually are?
Yay! increased price in oil products. I always dreamed of paying $10 a gallon for fuel!
Hello $7/gallon gas!

"FUCK ALL THIS SHIT!. WE THE PEOPLE ARE TAXED AROUND $1.20 PER GALLON FUCK THEIR TAX BREAKS&lt; FUCK OBAMA, FUCK IT ALL FUCKING COST ME $20 TO VISIT MY ELDERLY GRANDMA! It used to cost me $10."
why do we not tax the fuck out of Oil Companies? Its not like theyre going to pack up their oil and move to a different country. Actually Im all for nationalizing it and doing what Norway did. They now have something like 1 MIL in their national pension system per citizen. 
Where do I upvote Obama?
"[Congress wont even put oil executives under oath when questioning them about what theyre doing with all that money](http://thisishistorictimes.com/2013/05/under-pressure/), so of course they arent going to stop [giving it to them](http://thisishistorictimes.com/2011/05/gusher/)."
Oil companies dont need to be taxed more. We just need substantially improved tax laws closing loopholes. Actually I like the idea of a VAT in the US. Im pretty sure every other developed country has one.
Obama doesnt want to do shit.
So do I!
"I hope this is true, but doubt it."
"All Obama ever wants is sound bites and headlines like these, never any action besides trips to the golf course"
You fucking retards will believe anything! 
"How about ending subsides to any business that is turning a profit? Isnt that the proper republican way? Free market, no government assistance unless you need it. "

And I want to fly to the moon on a banana with my best friend Barney.
eliminate
Condos and cars for everyone in the administration! Like Oprah but its big oil. 
He also wants to eliminate economic growth and prosperity for America.
NOW were talkin.
He should of done this his first year in office when he said the same thing. 
Isnt it enough that we spent a Trillion on Iraq for the oil companies?
Good for him. I got and idea just drone strike the oil companies as that is how Obama solves problems.
"Well l, I make just over 40k a year and pay roughly $5500 premium for a family plan with a deductible of $2000 per person or $4000 max before the insurance really kicks in. The premium comes out pretax so it is probably not an exact comparison, but I would much rather pay the higher tax to get the free care as even with insurance you cant always afford the visit to the doctors. Even when the insurance kicks in, you still have out of pocket costs"
I pay $220 a month for zero prescription drug coverage and basically only emergency coverage. 
"The NHS **isnt** funded through NI. NI was created to build up entitlement to *pensions* not *healthcare*. The NHS is funded from general taxation. Still. You know. You had ... er... numbers We are still cheaper by far than the US - and with universal coverage and free-at-the-point-of-access. But - for example - I have a chronic condition for which, on the NHS, I can only get the 2nd-best class of drugs that slow down the progress of my being crippled and that will prevent me from dying *quite* as prematurely, rather than the very best and newer class of drugs that can reverse the progress of my particular disease, because the NHS under the guidelines of NICE will not fund them. And, by the way, since Ive had to have some significant dealings with the NHS, dating from about 6 years ago, Ive been misprescribed lethal drugs on 3 occasions by 2 different doctors, lied to about a letter sent from my consultant to my GP (my GP claimed hed never received it), and had to put up with the most astonishingly patronising, rude GP receptionists you could possibly imagine. I thought the people who moaned about the NHS were, you know, *moaners.* There is a real, significant problem with the understanding of service provision in the NHS - and severe over-staffing in the hospital department I have to attend monthly. And their computer system is so crap it couldnt manage to book an annual consultant appointment *one year in advance.* And I once caught my consultants registrar looking up my condition on Wikipedia. So...not all sweetness and light over here. Better than over there though, on the whole."
"&gt;The NHS isnt funded through NI. It is partially. I dont know the full breakdown so you are right to criticise. Plus, NI includes pensions so is it approximately representative as a comparison? I dont know. If you have better data please let me know and Ill update the original comment. I am very sorry that you have a chronic condition, but as I said the NHS isnt perfect. Ive had friends and family treated via the NHS for very severe conditions for long periods of time (talking years here) and only have good things to say about the hospitals, staff and service they receive so of course it varies. If you read through the other responses Im getting I think youll come to the same conclusion *Better than over there though, on the whole.*. My main point of the original comment was that a nationalised system is more effective and a more compassionate way to care for a population.. and one that is cheaper overall too. I hope NICE funds the newer class of drugs and wish for you good health."
Thank you for the interesting breakdown. Youve brought up how healthcare is funded but is it enough to actually pay for your countries health?
"I fall into the last bracket (or beyond or whatever), and I pay about $1500 a year for my (cheapest possible) healthcare, with my employer paying for the other half. I still have to pay co-pays and 10% up to $9,000. If I got the family plan, now its more like $3,600 (plus co-pays and all the rest)."
"Ill tell you what... Public health care saved my life. Literally! The car wreck I was in completely destroyed my face. Jaw broken in 4 places and my left eye orbital crushed into pieces. I was in a coma for a week and had 20 hours of reconstructive surgery. In the States I can only imagine what it would have cost me but I suspect it would have been in the seven figure range. (I guarantee you I wouldnt have been able to afford personal medical insurance at the time of the accident). A month in the hospital, follow up appointments, incredible rebuild on my face...all done and paid for BEFORE I sued the car Insurence provider (which by the way is another public Insurence provider. My monthly car Insurence is $95 a month). Colour me Canadian. Socialism does work. "
"Another point to bear in mind is that the US government pays out about the same amount per capita for health care (via Medicare, Medicaid etc.) as the UK government does"
&gt;were paying for it out the ass. Thats the exact phrase that prompted me to write the above post on the other article comments...
"Some quick links attesting to this fact: [BBC article, lil old now](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10375877) [Telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8877412/NHS-among-best-health-care-systems-in-the-world.html#mm_hash) [Global ranking, UK no. 18, USA 37](http://thepatientfactor.com/canadian-health-care-information/world-health-organizations-ranking-of-the-worlds-health-systems/) Not the best sourcing, but I believe that nationalised systems consistently rank higher than the USA."
"I personally pay a few hundred dollars more than the figure you listed. That excludes the portion my employer pays (about 60-70% of the entire amount per month), and the many deductibles/shared costs (20% of each procedure) that add to this. Ive been part of a socialized healthcare system and there is nothing in the US now that I would miss if I had to go to another socialized system."
"as american who is completely for nationalized health care, i dont get it either. All the british and canadian people ive talked to loved it. the only arguments americans have had is about wait times :/"
"Opponents of rational health care systems here tend to ignore the fact that, if we used a sensible system like the one in the UK, their increased tax burden would be more than offset by the elimination of insurance deductions from their paycheck. Considering the amount of money my employer spends on their side of insurance payments, one would think the American business community would be rampaging up and down the halls of Congress flaying legislators who opposed a tax based system."
"My wife &amp; I have fancy health insurance through her employer. I believe that it is capped at $3500.00 as the maximum that we would have as out of pocket expenses per year. This is on top of the cost of the insurance policy (I have no idea how much this is). Unlike the NHS this does not include dentistry (covered under separate insurance), which is really expensive. Ive used both the UK NHS and private health care here and much prefer the NHS. Here in the US healthcare is like someone is trying to make money off your misfortune. In the UK healthcare is someone is helping you to be healthy."
"My company has a pretty generous plan. I dont pay anything in premiums and the most I would have to pay out of pocket is $3000. Based on your figures above, Id be paying nearly $6000 in health tax. For me, the UK plan would cost me a lot more especially since I usually dont come anywhere close to $3000 in expenditures each year."
"It should also be pointed out that the Bismark System used ion the rest of Europe isnt actual government health care, but is universal and could be more easily adapted to the US. "
"In a discussion in another post, I made this comment (and still waiting for an answer) in regards to socialist healthcare systems being too expensive. I am curious to how this compares to what you guys in the US are currently paying: ________________________________________________________ See, here [UK] the NHS is funded by National Insurance (NI) contributions (which are effectively a tax on your income). So, using this [tax calculator](http://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php) Ive put in the contributions per year based on different salaries: * ?10k p/a (~$15.5k) - NI = ?269.40 / $417.29 * ?20k p/a (~$30.98k) - NI = ?1469.40 / $2274.79 * ?30k p/a (~$46.47k) - NI = ?2669.40 / $4131.64 * ?40k p/a (~$61.92k) - NI = ?3869.40 / $5988.21 * ?50k p/a (~$77.85k) - NI = ?4214.40 / $6562.24 How does that compare to your insurance? Before you answer, bear in mind that if you dont work, or are a kid you STILL get full coverage. Lose your job in a recession, still covered. Wife has a kid and no longer works, still covered. Also, when you need a prescription, it costs ~?8.40 (~$13.00) no matter on how much you have or how expensive the drugs. Dont get me wrong, the UK is expensive, we are taxed more than you guys and Im sure our system couldnt translate directly to yours (even if the vested commercial interests magically disappeared), but.. is our socialist healthcare really more expensive here? NI also goes towards the state pension Edit: Added ?50k **Edit 2:** Via /u/umbama who pointed out that NI doesnt fund the NHS. It does partially fund the NHS (as far as Im aware but this is also in dispute) with the rest coming from taxation. Thus, it is extremely difficult to get a full breakdown. However, [cost-per-head can be a good measure](http://www.nhshistory.net/parlymoney.pdf) (warning PDF). The UK cph is ~?2000 ($3116) whereas the US is closer to ?5000 ($7790). It should also be noted that we pay more in general taxation here in the UK than the US as well. So, read the above figures as EXTREMELY ball-park. However, the overwhelming response Im getting is that the US system is expensive (more than we pay even with the disputed figures above), it hinders freedom by making moving between jobs extremely difficult due to coverage and leads to people living with treatable illnesses until they are unbearable. The NHS isnt perfect and other countries have more effective systems, but one thing Im seeing is that a profit incentive for health is NOT a good idea."
&gt;Ive been part of a socialized healthcare system and there is nothing in the US now that I would miss if I had to go to another socialized system. Pretty damning indictment of the US system right there..
"&gt;Im not sure it really compares Well.. both pay for healthcare, albeit in very different ways. By showing the cost of one system Americans can compare how much they are paying. &gt;I cant even understand why Republicans support it Im sure this isnt limited to just Republicans; vested interest in insurance providers, pharma etc. a way to enslave the poor to jobs and suppress pay.. etc. etc. Edit: from chicofaraby above: *Absolutely. And many many prescriptions are simply not covered. And no, insurance is not portable for working people. It stays with the employers. That leverage over employees is why the business community doesnt complain.*"
I thought the US actually ended up paying out more? Partially because we save by paying early i.e. prevention and single-buyer pharmaceutical benefits?
"More than what I pay for myself and my wife, but my employer is contributing roughly $10 for every $1 I pay. Also, my mandatory state retirement thing is 3x as much per paycheck so, if adding that would be appropriate because NI includes the state pension, Im paying about 20% more."
"&gt;(even if the vested commercial interests magically disappeared), but.. is our socialist healthcare really more expensive here? The answer is a solid NO. &gt;?30k p/a (~$46.47k) - NI = ?2669.40 / $4131.64 &gt;?40k p/a (~$61.92k) - NI = ?3869.40 / $5988.21 I live in NY and make between the two amounts above. My insurance costs $8601.12."
"No, but a LOT of TV coverage and talking heads saying it wouldnt..."
It isnt more expensive that is a right wing myth. Universal healthcare is 1/3 to 2/3 cheaper than the U.S. and there has never been evidence provided that America is some how different and that this wouldnt work.
"That any American who isnt extensively rich can argue that their healthcare system works, or is fair or is better than a more socialist one simply shows the power of propaganda, people will actively support something that harms them, it seems the word socialism is a scary one to many to the point where common sense and decency doesnt matter any more, of course people should make profit off the ill and injured, how could that ever backfire?!"
"From the responses Im getting it really seems that even if you pay less for your premium, the other costs will ultimately end up in you paying more."
"Efficiencies of scale. The UK has one payer the US system has many. That means that there is duplicate staff, equipment, faculties in the US. A system like the US system will cost more unless there is some major corruption in the UK. "
Thanks for the info! Does your insurance also have an excess where you have to pay the first x-amount of each visit too? (As I seem to recall that being mentioned somewhere).
[deleted]
"A very good point, do you have any statistics relating to this? Also, it seems that most of the cost goes to insurers or over-priced drugs, do you have any idea as to the breakdown of where the funding comes from i.e. directly from govt funds or via the higher premiums people pay? "
"Im not sure it really compares, as National Insurance covers our healthcare and pension (as you mention) as well as unemployment benefits, and sickness and disability benefits. The US system seems absolutely crazy to me. I cant even understand why Republicans support it. It is extremely anti-business, as it discourages people from moving jobs or from trying to start their own business, if they are worried about losing health care....and it is criminally expensive. "
"I see a ton of complaining here about American health care costs and how the numbers you have would be better, etc. Im an American with American health insurance. I pay $110 every month in Florida out of pocket, with no help from my work. I have a $2000 or $2500 out of pocket max with that and a $200 deductible. If it wasnt explained to you, if I caught the doom plague, and was sent to the hospital, Id be responsible for $200 on my own, then I believe 40% of the bill up to $2000. If my treatment cost $2M, I would still pay $2000 and thats it. In all the years that Ive been alive, only once did I have problems where the doctors couldnt figure out why my knee gave out. Since it works still, and it has no problems, not really an issue. In the year and a half that Ive dealt with a public health care system in Australia, all I can suggest is -fuck that-. Wife has nothing but trouble with the free care. Sure its free, but alas, the doctor spends at best 10 minutes with you and sends you on your way. (They do this even if you pay them out of pocket instead.) Heaps of time waiting to see doctors for answers that dont come. I do, however, like the cost of XRays and CTs. Those are affordable without insurance. In the long run, Id rather be at home, paying a cap of $2k a year and getting doctors I want who seem to want to solve problems than ones who say, well we dont know, maybe come back in 6 weeks with your possible broken hand and well look again then, oh you are fussing about a splint, I guess we can make one for you. TL;DR dealt with both, Id rather have home. Did anyone ever check to see if they could get insurance from some place else that fits their needs and is more cost effective than an employers?"
"&gt;*their increased tax burden would be more than offset by the elimination of insurance deductions from their paycheck* This was my point, I feel like Im missing something when I debate Americans on healthcare - or maybe not communicating my original one well enough. The convo usually gets mired in rights and socialism-bashing, which I frankly dont understand. If you arent averse to answering this I would be grateful for a reply; how does my original post compare to what you pay (a simple more or less is enough, no need to talk about salaries on reddit :-)."
"Australia is even simpler it is a 1.5% levy on income for Medicare (our public universal system), with an additional 1% if you dont have private insurance and earn over AUD$70k/year, and there are exclusions for low income earners. Public basically covers doctor visits, tests, hospital and drug costs, private covers additional dental, optical and optional extras. Private cover is pretty cheap since it is an additional coverage to Medicare, not a complete plan, a young single individual is like $15/week, it is not the same as US private plans."
"Since all the replies mention company plans where the employer pays part of the cost, I thought Id mention what Im looking at paying. I say looking at because my wife and I are currently uninsured and have been for a while now. Im a grad student and make about $19K a year. She just finished her masters and is working through a temp agency until she can find something in her field and has a base pay of about $37k (overtime brings in more). That puts us just under $60K/year total before taxes. My wife has been doing the searching, so I will give you the information as I remember what she has told me. We are looking at an individual (ie. not through a group or employer) plan that covers both of us. The best quote weve found so far comes out to approximately $260/month ($3120/year). For that amount we get a fairly high deductible (I think it was $7500/person/year) with a 20% copay once the deductible is met. I believe well person visits are free once per year, but any other visit (including due to illness) are $35 per visit. Any emergency care, x-ray, or lab test are payed out of pocket until deductible is met. Bottom line, if you stay healthy and only have to do a yearly well check up... then it is less expensive. If you ever get sick, injured, and/or have to have any lab work... then it will add up very quickly and cost a lot more. edit: I should note that while the 1 well vist a year is free, any lab work that is done will cost you. So, the blood work to check your cholesterol that the doctor always does... usually well over $100."
"There are concerns about quality and waiting times for National Care systems. In the US, Cancer survival rates are much better than they are in the UK. You might not expect that to be true with all those uninsured people in the US, but it is. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-136377/US-v-UK-The-breast-cancer-survival-stakes.html http://www.pop.org/content/cancer-survival-rates-far-worse-great-britain-us Not a simple issue(more in the links) but the fact that the uninsured in the US have a better breast cancer survival rate than those covered in the UK does make you do a double take: http://www.factcheck.org/2009/08/cancer-rates-and-unjustified-conclusions/ "
"The drop between insured and uninsured is significant though. I wonder if US stats include people that are just too broke to go to the doctor and die off the books? Also, dont quote the dailymail, they are not a reputable source, to say the least!"
"Non-US citizens dont seem to realize that if/when the US gets Universal Healthcare their costs will no longer be subsidized by the US. The US pays the largest share in R&amp;D, all these national health systems only pay prices on manufacturing, not R&amp;D and Marketing."
"&gt; Youre probably young and male, and your insurance costs are low because youre exceptionally low risk. Not everyone gets those rates. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that if youre older, youre more risky to insure. So they cant go to the damn doctor until its too late and get ultra expensive conditions that were left alone too long. Now, if an old person got regular check ups wed all be far better off. The cheapest way to lower health care costs is obviously prevention. Dont encourage people to sit there until its a massive and costly problem. Let people go to the doctor whenever the hell they want. "
"&gt; the cheapest way to lower health care costs is obviously prevention. [Probably not](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money-it-doesnt/) &gt; The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall, CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive. &gt; ? a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs. "
I simply cant believe you actually think the way you do in spite of the facts. You arent paid out the same amounts you paid in. Period. End of story. I suppose ignorance truly is bliss.
"You havent given any facts. I showed that pretty much everything youve posted has been wrong. You even posted links yourself that proved you were wrong. And I didnt claim you are paid out the same amounts that you pay in.

Yeah they were dropping to historically low levels before Obamacare... and then spiked again. http://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2011/10/premium-growth.png
Insurance costs were pretty stable before Obamacare. Double digit rises every year were pretty unheard of. /s
"Yes, but read the link. The deferred income was set up so that it would not change, no matter what happened with Halliburton stock. So enriching the company would not affect his income."
Cheney didnt have any stock in the company after leaving? 
"His money was in a blind trust, and that trust has holdings in Halliburton."
"Yes, but see my comment above. Or better yet, actually read that link."
[Halliburton gave Dick Cheney a $34 million payout when he left the company to join the presidential ticket.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/24/chris-matthews/chris-matthews-says-cheney-got-34-million-payday-h/)

No. He divested himself of morals years ago.
"True. Once again, he divested himself so awarding contracts to Halliburton didnt affect his income."
AFAIK when Cheney went into the WH - it was set up so that he would receive tons of deferred income from Halliburton after he was no longer in office - and now he is probably reaping full benefits once again.
He signed a contract pledging his stock money to charity. Its all explained in the link above.
"Except they may not lose that much. Remember the whole redmap/super-gerrymandering thing? Where the majority of people can vote against Republicans and yet Republicans still hold a majority in the House? Thats why they did that. An intentional effort to ensure the House of Representatives does not actual represent the people, but instead represents their party. Fraud and disenfranchisement on a grand and effective scale. And before anyone throws out the both sides bullshit. When was the last time that one party had a majority in the House, while the other party had a majority of the votes? (and this is highlighted by a big win for an unpopular President and significantly different majority in the Senate)."
"thats why we have to push for reform now, and tackle those district maps. I dont want an unfair advantage -just a fighting chance. The districts need to be fair. And we need to fight for it."
Second time in about 70 years. [Here is some source to back up your claims.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/)
"Ugh I hate to say it but youre right. They know what theyre doing and they learned from their mistakes. Also its an off-year election, so only the super-motivated (read: Tea Partiers wanting to send Obama a message) will turn out."
[The Obama Administration said that you can keep your current plan no fewer than 37 times.](http://www.politifact.com/obama-like-health-care-keep/)
"And you can. The bill does not cancel your plans. The private insurance company is canceling them, maybe you should stop being stupid and realize the private insurance company never made the claim."
"That is not a broken promise, you can keep your existing plan. The ACA doesnt prevent that. Blaming him because the private insurance industry decided to cancel their grandfathered plans is rather hilarious. Do you have down syndrome? This issue you are crying about is exactly what the ACA fixes. People wont have to go through reapplying every year for a new plan anymore."
"The blame for Obamas broken promise. He said If you like your insurance plan, you can keep it. Period. Period means no if, ands or buts. You like it - you keep it. He also said that no one is going to take it away from you. As is now clear to everyone, the ACA can not deliver on these promises. The insurance companies can take it away. If they changed the plan the ACA may **require** that they take it away. Employers can take it away. Obamas promises were clearly unrealistic. As you pointed out, insurance companies cancel policies every year. How on earth could Obama make these promises when it only takes a little thought to see that they cant be kept? "
"&gt;This is just an effort to shift the blame from Obama to the insurance companies. What? Obama isnt to blame to begin with, any plan created before the ACA was signed is grandfathered. The insurance companies have canceled plans yearly and killed their own grandfathered plans. The only dumb thing about this bill is he needs to let republicans take the credit so when it fails, republicans can no longer falsely blame Obama because their bullshit logic will now apply to them."
You havent read enough or are a liar. Down vote for your shitty summary of research.
"The 77 cents myth is so pervasive that even [President Obama](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-women-are-paid-77-cents-dolla/) is repeating it. When you account for factors like major choices, hours worked, marriages, etc the gap is more like 2-5%. Truly, in this day and age women are more equal in pay then at any other point in history. "
The last pub I read in spring of last year put the number around 8%. 
"Thats assuming the Republican establishment lets Christie in the primaries or debates. They dont like him and the Tea Party crowd hates him. He hugs Democrats, to put it in their words."
"Before I go into my nitpicking, allow me to clarify in advance: I do not think a HRC -- or democrat in general -- win in 2016 is anything close to a guaranteed event, and I would in fact be highly skeptical of assigning anything beyond lets wait till at least late 2015 to really start hedging bets in either direction. I think it is foolish for anyone to write Christie off, but I also think it is foolish for anyone to presume his success. I also think you can safely swap Christie with just about any 2016 potential nominee in the prior sentence. Dont forget, not even a year ago, Rubio was seen as a GOP front runner. Now it looks like he probably wont even be able to justify trying. &gt; Check the recent polls. Christie, a governor who doesnt get a whole lot of exposure outside of the northeast, [...] He was all over the political headlines everywhere after his reelection, he immediately became the GOP magical cure-all, practically overnight. Yes, HRC has near-universal name recognition, but Christie already has some of the highest of the potential GOP field for 2016. However, theres a big difference between in the recognition of each candidate: voter knowledge of them. While more people know about HRC, far, far, far more people have an idea of her political positions. For most people, theyll know of Christie, theyll know of his great political popularity in NJ despite the political tide there being against him, but they wont really know his positions: hes an ideal blank canvas for undecided voters to paint their hopes on. That wont last through a primary season, let alone a general election. Plus, Id never put any serious stock in presidential polls this far in advance. Christie is the frontrunner for the GOP -- but only today. [At this point in the 2008 primary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates), Obama had only been mentioned as a poll option *once*. &gt; [...] plus he puts NJ and maybe even NY into play Put NJ in play? Eh, maybe. In a strategic sense, not likely, though possible -- certainly not guaranteed. In a media sense, itll force both sides to contest the state no matter what, just for appearances sake. New York, however? Hahaha, not a chance. Youd almost be more likely to see HRC flip Arkansas back to blue ([which I wouldnt bet a nickel on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012#Votes_by_states)). Home states matter a lot less in modern presidential politics, especially when ideological identities are flipped between candidate and state. Perfect example: MA moved closer to Obama in 2012, relative to the rest of the nation, despite Romney being from there. &gt; Probably not the black vote like Obama, though. Any democratic nominee in 2016 will have one of the best surrogates for the black vote: the first black president, Barrack Obama. Beyond that, [blacks have been a hugely safe and reliable constituency for democrats as far back as FDR](http://origin.factcheck.org/Images/image/2008/ask_factcheck_images/april2008/BlackVote/Black_Vote_Pres.jpg). Barring a sudden racial political scandal in between now and election day 2016, the democratic candidate will win black voters by overwhelming margins, with 80% probably being the floor of support. Again, not saying that any victory is preordained or even that Id feel confident predicting one way or the other right now. But a lot of the logic youre using for your argument in support of Christie v HRC doesnt really make sense."
...not that youre biased.
"Never said I wasnt. But I think my analyses is still correct. I foresaw Romney losing, even though I wanted Obama to lose. But I think Christie has the best chance of anyone in the pipes to win in three years."
"&gt; check the recent polls Ok, great idea! Lets see...whoa, here are a bunch of polls... [wait, these show Clinton ahead](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-christie-vs-clinton) Idiot "
"Funny how real clear politics has Christi winning in battleground sates. I am sure Huffington is completely unbiased, though. The national average doesnt matter if Christie can win in Iowa, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado and NJ, even though there are polls that show he will win the national average as well. And all this before he starts campaigning for it. You are a fool."
"Check the recent polls. Christie, a governor who doesnt get a whole lot of exposure outside of the northeast, beats Clinton, former first lady to Bill, senator to NY, presidential candidate runner up, and secretary of state, in Pennsylvania, Iowa, Colorado and Virginia with a tie in Ohio, plus he puts NJ and maybe even NY into play. And this is all before Christie puts his political machine into motion and starts campaigning nationwide. If you think Clinton has this wrapped up in a nice little bow, you are a moron. Clinton will get the women and minority vote like every Democrat. Probably not the black vote like Obama, though. Christie has access to money. He is close friends with that Zuckerberg guy, you know from the Facebook thingy, plus he is from one of the wealthiest states int he country, and well loved there. And if you dont think Christie can look presidential, you need to look at the videos of him after hurriane sandy. He is far more presidential than I have ever seen Obama. He has gravitas (no, not a fat joke) and a n nonsense way of speaking that just works. He destroyed Buono, a very liberal woman, in the last election. I hope he runs because while I dont agree with him on everything, he would be much much better than another Democrat running us into the ground like Obama."
Christie has to go through the Republican primaries. He will be scythed down by the likes of Santorum.
"I am not confusing them. Obama has increased both faster than Bush. And the balanced budget Bush inherited was not actually balanced. It was an accounting trick employed by the Clinton administration by keeping certain big ticket items off budget so it appeared there was extra money while simultaneously robbing the social security trust. Please stop throwing around the lie that Clinton created a surplus. He didnt. It was all an illusion. Here is a handy little chart: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Total_Deficits_vs._National_Debt_Increases_2001-2010.png Democrats controlled the house and senate in 2008 and 2009. Obama took over in 2009. See how the blue deficit bar triples under their fine leadership? And then it dips a tiny bit until 2013, when those evil republicans start demanding cuts in pending and sequestrations and the blood of puppy dogs on their alters to Ayn Rand or are you now saying that the reductions in spending Democrats opposed every screaming step of the way were a good thing? The proof is in the pudding. Dems run higher deficits that Reps. They should both be flogged publicly. I would rather them not use misdirection to say they cut $6B here over 10 years while increasing spending $20B over there. And I would like them to not say they cut spending when all they do is decrease the amount the budget was set to grow. Your metric says nothing about the size and scope of government. If all those workers were working for free, I wouldnt care how many of them there are. Like I said, size does not refer JUST to the number of people employed by the government. Yeah, the war on drugs. Nixon, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, Bush II, and Obama. Dont pretend democrats dont fight the war on drugs. How about the war on guns, the war on poverty, the war on privacy. How about the NDAA, indefinite detention, drone war, kill lists. Those are all things Obama has not only continued, but expanded and fought for. Republicans wanted to remove indefinite detention a couple years ago and Obama had his lobbyists lobby for them to put it back in or else he wouldnt sign it.

"&gt; Obama has increased both faster than Bush. No, the deficit has been halved under obama. I have already demonstrated this. &gt; It was an accounting trick employed by the Clinton administration by keeping certain big ticket items off budget so it appeared there was extra money while simultaneously robbing the social security trust. Please stop throwing around the lie that Clinton created a surplus. He didnt. It was all an illusion. http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/ even if we remove Social Security from the equation, there was a surplus of $1.9 billion in fiscal 1999 and $86.4 billion in fiscal 2000. under accrual accounting the government would book immediately the costs of promises made to pay future benefits to government workers and Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries. But even under accrual accounting, the annual reports showed surpluses of $69.2 billion in fiscal 1998, $76.9 billion in fiscal 1999, and $46 billion for fiscal year 2000. So even if the government had been using that form of accounting the deficit would have been erased for those three years. Deal with it. &gt; Democrats controlled the house and senate in 2008 and 2009. Obama took over in 2009. See how the blue deficit bar triples under their fine leadership? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis See how subprime lending explodes in the early 2000s? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Subprime_mortgage_originations,_1996-2008.GIF What was fueling that? Ah thats right, banks were going out and making [garbage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Subprime_Mortgage_Offer.jpeg) loans, then had them packaged up as AAA, and sold off to chumps in the private market. The loans were ARM, so they implosion of the cdo could be delayed a few years while the banks continued to apply their midas touch to everything they could get their hands on. Fraud is always profitable. Republicans destroyed the economy and democrats got elected on account of that. Trying to spin it into democrats got elected around the same time that everything went to shit makes you look like a retard. &gt; And then it dips a tiny bit until 2013, when those evil republicans start demanding Are you kidding? That happened day one when the tea party clown car pulled into town and took the house. Remember how they ran on job creation? http://republicanjobcreation.com/2011.html What did finally fix the deficit was economic recovery, not some debt ceiling/sequester hijinks to fire working people. &gt; Dems run higher deficits that Reps. Every year before that, obama had constantly, consistently reduced the deficit a hundred billion dollars. &gt; And I would like them to not say they cut spending when all they do is decrease the amount the budget was set to grow. Trigger words are too much for you to handle? Poor thing. The first step is realizing that youre brainwashed. &gt; size does not refer JUST to the number of people employed by the government. Wupty doo. Submit the objective metric you are using to measure the size of govt by or be dismissed as basing your arguments on [bellyfeel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Newspeak_words). &gt; Dont pretend democrats dont fight the war on drugs. You have a shit ton more support for ending the war on drugs inside of the democratic party than from the supposedly libertarian tea party congress. &gt; Republicans wanted to remove indefinite detention a couple years ago No they didnt. http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/05/republicans-ndaa-detention-terrorist In may they were all for it. http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/11/congress-outlawed-indefinite-detention-or-did-they By november, they were trying to have their cake and eat it too. &gt; How about the war on guns Look to state/local governments. So long as democrats stay away from the wishy washy definition of assault weapon and focus on actual problems, their ideas are forced to be pretty moderate on account of how spastic people can be about their guns. &gt; the war on poverty what about it? &gt; NDAA Fair enough. &gt; the war on privacy dubya &gt; drone war political suicide to send troops into harms way when our flying assassin robots succeed. &gt; take him to task for not ending these things Wars dont work like that. Shame on republicans for lying us into a war with no coherent set of objectives, aside from moving troops around arbitrarily until people arnt shooting at us anymore. But hey, sure, reform under obama has been pretty stale, his negotiation tactics are to preconcede, then concede some more. Alot of things he seems to have retreated on completely, but dont forget for a second who thought this stuff was so great in the first place."

On my phone so ill keep it short. More people means more demand which means more jobs. Supply and demand. If the immigrants just took the money and shoved it in some hole and imported all their supplies from Mexico that would be bad. But they are here driving business just like every other American. 
Yes they still need to pay living expenses that are taxed and bring money into the economy. Money is transferred daily all over the US by non-immigrants hell I used to send a few hundred a month up to a family member in Canada does that make me part of the issue? Your link does not say anything about the ratio of illegals to natural born/ legal immigrants. Cut out all illegals and it will be a drop in the ocean. Do we just stop allowing money wiring all together? Illegals consume and drive demand just like everyone else no one can disagree with that. 
&gt; More people means more demand which means more jobs. Illegals in the US consume as little as possible and send much of their pay back to their home countries - so they dont create much in the way of jobs and they remove wealth from the US as well. &gt; If the immigrants just took the money and shoved it in some hole and imported all their supplies from Mexico that would be bad. [Does sending the money back to Mexico](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2271455/Revealed-How-immigrants-America-sending-120-BILLION-struggling-families-home.html) count as shoving it in a hole? They consume as little as possible here. &gt; But they are here driving business just like every other American. Not even close.
http://toprightnews.com/?p=1312 Illegals are not paying income taxes. Many of them are getting welfare. Some are even filing tax returns and getting money back! http://www.factcheck.org/2012/05/tax-credits-for-illegal-immigrants/ 
"&gt;Illegals are not paying income taxes. Many of them are getting welfare. Most Americans do not pay income tax. Plus Immigrants do pay sales, property tax and the the long term immigrants will often have fake or stolen Credentials so taxes will be taken out of their paycheck like everyone else. Illegal immigrant workforce participation is a hell of a lot higher than native born american. And the amount in taxes that the illegals pay in is a hell of a lot more than they take out in social programs. The thing you linked at the end is a tax credit for american children and by all means they do have american citizen children so there should be no problem with them claiming this. "
And the key to persuading someone to the correct view is to understand that they have good intentions. Coming at people like theyre satan only results in violence.
"&gt;Just be a little more understanding; Someone needs to be more understanding. Specifically, these clowns need a little bit better understanding of BASIC MATH. If your goal is LESS ABORTIONS then you SUPPORT PLANNED PARENTHOOD and FREE CONTRACEPTION and SEX EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS. See because those things - if you do a little basic math - lead to FEWER ABORTIONS. But when you spew ignorance like abstinence and you kneecap health educators and you eliminate easy access to contraception - you GET MORE ABORTIONS. If you make the abortions extra hard to get - you GET MORE DEAD WOMEN. That?s understanding. These aren?t rational people. The don?t understand anything."
The road to hell is paved with good intentions. 
"Hey, quick question, anyone remember the days when the religious right condoned firebombing clinics and attacking/threatening/shooting doctors and nurses for working at the clinics? Pretty sure the had the same motivations. Really wasnt THAT long ago..."
Which is why they spend just as much time picketing/bombing/legally targeting IVF treatment centres right? Because if there is any sort of unequal attention being given two these two murder centres then apparently they are full of crap when they say it is because they are against killing the pre-born.
It is absolutely malicious to work to engender a society where young women are coerced into delivering babies they cant care for because of a lack of education and availability of family planning services.
The road to Hell blab blab blab.
Light in the dark
"Not entirely true, and I suspect you know this. They want to shame and punish women(and other minorities) for their sins. They dont give a shit about the children, because according to those people, those same children can go fuck themselves once theyre out of the womb. (see support for cutting of SNAP/WIC/social safety nets) As George Carlin said, Conservatives want live babies to grow up to be dead soldiers. And you dont make cannon fodder by giving children opportunities and lifting their families out of poverty. "
&gt; they arent being malicious about it. Bull. Fucking. Shit.
"Being understanding only goes so far. When the person youre debating with sees your facts or science as some sort of liberal plot to take God out of their lives, then youve got a problem. Understanding their position will get you nowhere, as they will refuse to bend in the slightest. Doing so would be an affront to their God. They may not be malicious, but it is a Holy war for them. They will do whatever it takes, no matter the cost, to save those babies in the name of Jesus."
"Some of them do, some dont. Either way they are relying on misinformation and deceit to further their agenda, fuck them either way. If they gave a damn about the children theyd have no issue with pre-k, reduced/free lunch &amp; breafast, daycare or other programs. They only want to see them out of the womb, theyre fine with letting them rot past that."
"&gt; Their methods might not save any unborn children, but they arent being malicious about it. Abortion clinic bombings? Summary executions of doctors, even inside a church? Right-wing domestic terrorism: a disease that many Americans would like to continue to ignore. "
"Nope. They do not believe this. If they cared at all about babies lives theyd be for school lunch programs, for Medicaid expansion, for SNAP. Babies lives is just the pretty rhetoric they use to get millions of uneducated religious wingnuts to support them in their ultimate goal: controlling women. They want us barefoot and pregnant: out of the workforce and producing future dead soldiers. Its not coincidence that [higher levels of education are tied to voting democrat](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/nov/05/larry-sabato/education-level-tied-voting-tendencies/). If Republicans dont deny women the opportunity to obtain education and rise out of poverty, theyll lose even more of their voting base. "
"&gt; They sincerely believe theyre saving babies lives. Funny how they never protest outside in-vitro fertilization clinics then, isnt it? Lots of fetuses are disposed of at those clinics all the time. Yet, not a peep. Its just another of those rage over reason issues that American politicians exploit for votes. "
"Dude. They sincerely believe theyre saving babies lives. Dont talk like theyre actively looking to turn America into nazi Germany. They believe theyre just as right as you believe you are. Their methods might not save any unborn children, but they arent being malicious about it. Just be a little more understanding; you wont convince anyone with this us versus them attitude."
"Im sure there are pro-lifers who genuinely want to save potential lives of some unborn babies, but the problem is theyve bought into and are supporting the rhetoric spouted by national organizations that have a set agenda that oppose contraception, sex education, and other womens health issues. Thats not even mentioning the coordinated attacks against same sex marriage. Its definitely an us vs them thing. However, the them is not the individuals, its those national organizations. Theyre easy to pick out. Look for the ones with words like family and life in their name."

"Youre parroting a long discredited Mitt Romney ad. And one of the big reasons Romney lost was because his ads were full of lies, since the truth hurt him so much and hes a pathological liar, and he got totally busted on it. If the best you can come up with is parroting the old discredited lies of a loser, then I really feel sorry for you, and you should rethink your political beliefs, because theyre wrong, and they make you look like a complete idiot. [Politicact.com truth-o-mater: Mitt Romney says Obama has racked up as much debt as almost all of the other presidents combined.: **Mostly False**](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-has-racked-much-debt-almost/) &gt;Romney was trying to revive a talking point -- that by the end of his first term, Obama will have added as much debt as all the prior 43 presidents combined -- that was accurate enough to earn a Mostly True from PolitiFact. This time, though, he allowed small but significant changes to creep in and weaken its accuracy. &gt;Romney confused public debt and gross debt; he failed to clarify that he was talking about the debt accruing during the entirety of Obama?s first term; and he misplaced the word almost in a way that makes it hard to parse his claim. If we use the public debt figure and put the word almost where the Romney campaign says it should be, almost might apply to one of three comparisons -- one in which the debt is about four-fifths of the way to equalling totals under previous presidents. That?s a grain of truth, but not much more. We rate the statement Mostly False. [Factcheck.org: The Facts According to Obama and Romney Ads](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/the-facts-according-to-obama-and-romney-ads/) &gt;Romney campaign ad: President Obama says he?s creating jobs, but he?s really creating debt. The facts are clear. Obama?s four deficits are the four largest in U.S. history. He?s adding almost as much debt as all 43 previous presidents combined. And over 30 cents of every dollar Obama spends is borrowed, much of it from countries like China. He?s not just wasting money. He?s borrowing it, and then wasting it. We can?t afford four more years. &gt;**The claim that ?Obama?s four deficits are the four largest in U.S. history? ignores the fact that Obama inherited most of his first deficit when he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009.** &gt;As we have written many times before, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the fiscal year 2009 deficit at $1.2 trillion two weeks before Obama took office. That fiscal year started Oct. 1, 2008. Due to some additional spending under Obama, the deficit increased to $1.4 trillion for fiscal year 2009. At the end of the fiscal year, **the CBO largely blamed the 2009 deficit on the recession, specifically a sharp decline in tax revenues and an increase in spending in response to the economic crisis ? first by Bush and later by Obama**. &gt;Deficits have remained high under Obama, but have come down from that $1.4 trillion peak. The deficits in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 were both $1.3 trillion. And in an Oct. 5 CBO report that it dubbed ?2012 Deficit: Smaller, But Still Big,? it estimates the just-concluded 2012 fiscal year ran a deficit of about $1.1 trillion. It would be accurate to say that Obama was president during three of the four largest deficit years in American history, but **he bears only a small measure of responsibility for the largest**. &gt;The ad also claims that Obama is ?adding almost as much debt as all 43 previous presidents combined.? [We first looked into a similar claim back in February](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/02/dueling-debt-deceptions/) when it was included in a partisan graphic circulating via email and Facebook. **It was wrong then, and remains so today.** [GOP claim that President Obama has spent more than every other president combined is a total fabrication, and actually the opposite of the truth.](http://theimmoralminority.blogspot.nl/2012/05/gop-claim-that-president-obama-has.html) &gt;Although there was a big stimulus bill under Obama, federal spending is rising at the slowest pace since Dwight Eisenhower brought the Korean War to an end in the 1950s. &gt;Here are the facts, according to the official government statistics: &gt;+ In the 2009 fiscal year ? the last of George W. Bush?s presidency ? federal spending rose by 17.9% from $2.98 trillion to $3.52 trillion. Check the official numbers at the Office of Management and Budget. &gt; + In fiscal 2010 ? the first budget under Obama ? spending fell 1.8% to $3.46 trillion. &gt; + In fiscal 2011, spending rose 4.3% to $3.60 trillion. &gt; + In fiscal 2012, spending is set to rise 0.7% to $3.63 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office?s estimate of the budget that was agreed to last August. &gt; + Finally in fiscal 2013 ? the final budget of Obama?s term ? spending is scheduled to fall 1.3% to $3.58 trillion. "
Except that Obama has spent more than every president before him combined while in Office. 
Weird seeing the hometown newspaper on here. To think we used to be proud of being from BC. The new brass up there in Lansing serve as yet another fantastic reminder why I moved away. 
"So if they bought drugs with their meager salaries, it would be okay? What does that say about politicians? Dont they get paid with tax dollars? I dont want my tax dollars going to drug use, especially when the addicts are representatives. I say, lets spontaneously test the senate for drugs, but then I suppose then we wouldnt have a government anymore. Obviously they are high as fuck."
They are desperate to drive the minorities (which nearly all vote democrat) out of the state any way they can find and ram through the legislature. Michigan is owned by the right wing tea party right now. They also passed a lifetime limit on welfare benefits IFIRC.
All while the legislature refuses to drug test its own members. They are beating up on the poor as a smoke screen for their corruption.
FINALLY
"This actually worked in another state. (Utah was it?) Suspicion based, as I interpret, invokes reasonable cause for questioning. They dont actually have to test anyone. Id venture to say a large majority of those on some form of government benefits arent doing drugs. Those that are, may not be exemplary members of society but their not dirt bags either. Sometimes people will do what they can for as long as they until theyve reached even the smallest obstacle. If someone has a reason to be questioned about drug use or tested, they still have the option to opt out. It sounds really uncomfortable but it does legally operate within the Fourth Amendment."
"i dont see whats wrong with this. its pretty easy to tell if someone is using drugs excessively. if youre using drugs to the point where a social worker or welfare agent knows that you use them, then you probably do have a problem and shouldnt be spending tax payers money. if a politician or other government employee does their job while high, they should also be drug tested. "
I take it Michigans new state motto is: *Michigan: We dont learn from other states mistakes!*
http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2014303200013 Suspicion-based drug testing of welfare recipients would become the norm under a bill passed by the Michigan state Senate Thursday 
"Former welfare worker here - two things: caseworkers already assess clients for D&amp;A dependency and are referred to treatment as part of their compliance to continue to receive benefits. Secondly, welfare clients statistically are actually less likely to be using than the population at large. Thes pre-application drug testing programs have already failed in other states. They are essentially an income stream generally designed to line the pockets of testing companies at taxpayer expense. "
"Id love to believe that the glaring fact that tests cant prove a substance in someones system was purchased with taxpayer dollars demonstrates simply that Republicans pushing this legislation have extremely poor reasoning and logic. But given that over the years, our friends on the right have continually demonstrated their willingness to split the baby rather than do whats best for our country, Im pretty sure their agenda here is to make sure people on welfare are as miserable as possible. They arent even *pretending* to adhere to conservative principles anymore."
So is this better or worse than Floridas welfare drug testing law? Or is it still going to be a waste of time and money?
"Basically, if they are black, they are suspicious. "
Let me know when we can drug test the legislature.
If were suspicious of a Congress person can we get them to piss in a cup too?
what a complete waste of money
Michigan is absolutely blowing it these days.
"I used to support the idea of this, until i researched how much corporations are given subsidies and help from the federal government. No one wants to pay for someone elses drug/ alcohol vices, anymore than anybody wants to pay for a CEOs bonus, made possible through bailouts and subsidized help. Also, welfare amounts to about 1% of what corporations get from the government, in help and tax right offs. I think that we should pass a law that requires all politicians to wear suits which show which campaign donors have given them donations. Also, the size of the donations would be represented on the suit as well, much like Nascar and their sponsers. Its not a new idea, but its an idea i think should have its day in the sun. "
"I would think this would be a violation of the 4th amendment: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.["
&gt;Melanin-based drug testing Fixed that headline for ya.
"My understanding is that this is illegal, (struck down by courts) since its profiling based on income. How exactly are they skirting this? Also, given the available data, and the fine of $4700 (which is certainly going to be paid back by the welfare recipients /s), how do they think this program helps? How much cognitive dissonance must they suffer from to announce this plan while claiming Jesus is on their side? "
Theyd rather waste their money than use it.
"Treating drug addiction as a crime, has been proven to be almost entirely ineffective. Just where do these republicans expect those who get cut off welfare to go? It appears they are in favour of more homelessness, more crime, and more prisoners. What a ideal solution./s"
"Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, said the testing was needed to protect the children of drug users. ...by taking away their financial aid? How the fuck does this protect anyone from anything?"
good. Maybe we can start drug testing our public servants as well. 
"More epic stupidity from the GOP, a Party that just doesnt learn. Florida did the same thing and it turned out to be a waste of money. Florida has implemented a similar program and referred about 22% of recipients for drug testing. Only 5% tested positive for drug use. They want to test people that are so poor that they need help to feed their kids. The odds of a parent having the money to buy drugs in that situation are very slim, as Floridas numbers show. The fucking Republicans really need to get a clue..."
"FTA: ?The vote you?re about to take is not against the poor of this state. It?s for the children,? he said. ?Children are starving, they?re hungry because their parents are abusing the welfare that we?re giving them.? Oh no! Mercy, mercy...What about the CHILDREN?!! (says the crowd that cheers excitedly when they hear about children having their school lunches yanked from under their noses and thrown in the trash right in from of them). Im sick to death of Democrats allowing the polluters and climate change deniers pimp children. Its truly disgusting."
could anyone be against this? does anyone thinks it is ok to ask the government for assistance while using drugs. that would mean the tax payers are paying for the drugs.
"I would support this if some conditions were met. The first is that after being kicked off welfare, they get the option to go to rehab, and upon completion, they are allowed to receive welfare again (if they qualify). The second is that marijuana and alcohol are treated equally. The third is that even if caught with hardcore drugs, there is a two strike policy before being kicked off of welfare. The people addicted to drugs do not deserve to be treated like criminals. No one wants to be addicted to meth or heroin and live so impoverished that they need welfare. No one wants to just get by on welfare. They chose to use drugs in the beginning, but eventually the drugs control them. And who are we to deny someone a joint or some alcohol every other day? People on welfare deserve to have some sort of fun (not sure what to call it) because what quality of life would they have if other people mandated what they spend that money on?"
That will cost more than it ...saves? 
"Why stop at welfare recipients? Why not do this to all government employees? But seriously, the people who come up with these ideas just want to attack these programs. There is no benefit to doing this."
"So many questions come out of this. 1. What happens to the kids who are no longer getting food? How is this helping them? 2. Is there any proof that testing is actually going to incentivize people to stop taking drugs? 3. The $4,700 savings is only the money not given to the people kicked out of the program. These people are going to have to turn to other services to get food, or at the worst, they turn to crime, which quickly eats into that savings. "
"Just a reminder for everyone: - Florida shelled out more money for drug testing than it saved by denying welfare benefits to people who tested positive for drugs.

"Democrat here... I had to get drug tested when I got hired, I really dont see the problem with it. It isnt invasive, its standard for a physical, job, etc. Why not this?"
Test the CEOs of the corporate welfare bailouts 
"Ah, the poor. The lazy, drug abusing, lobster eating, nanny state mooching poor always taking my hard earned dough to live the good life, what with 99.6% of them owning refrigerators and all."
This person is applying for welfare. Welfare? They must be a drug addict! Test them! *suspicion*
Basically the idea is to try to make the process of registering ones-self as poor as humiliating as possible to discourage people from doing so. Their goal is to make their own (the politicians) failure less apparent.
"The problem isnt suspicion-based testing; its whose suspicions were basing the testing on. Honestly, we all know how to spot a druggie."
Let them do it. Theyre going to catch 2 people out of a million. Totally worth the time and effort.
Does this also include their corporate overlords?
And why shouldnt welfare recipients take drug tests?
government run drug testing for millions of people thats gonna be real cheap and cost effective....
"Huge waste of money. When Florida did it, they found a whopping 20 something people. Rick Scott made hella money off it though. Whos benefiting off of Michigans?"
"I bet theyll be surprised how much GMs system is full of various drugs, which is probably worse than the amount of drugs in the water supply. Oh, they mean poor people, not corporations on welfare, nevermind."
"Its a waste of tax payer money, its a handout to the labs conducting the tests, and they never catch hard drug abusers because typically drugs like cocaine, heroine, meth, and so on and so forth dissipate from your system within a couple of days. Its sad that instead of trying to help the poor in this country we try and shit on them by making them out to be lazy no good drug abusing moochers. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc--dFFp7mY Heres a good source that explains the effectiveness of drug testing welfare recipients. https://www.aclu.org/drug-law-reform/drug-testing-public-assistance-recipients-condition-eligibility Thank you Technophiled for the link!"
"I mean, the way I look at it is that if you dont have money to live, you shouldnt have money for drugs. Theyre fucking expensive. But suspicion based shit is bull. You need to test everyone or no-one, and then just deny welfare to those who fail the tests. Dont send them to jail or anything, just dont pay out welfare to them."
How about corporate welfare recipients?
"Some bosses do this on their own. I had a boss who said I dont care if you do drugs, and I dont typically even test for them. But if you hit a customer over the head with a shovel, well..."
"&gt; Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, said the testing was needed to **protect the children** of drug users. By making their families even poorer..."
Better to waste a whole shitload of money humiliating poor people than to feed children! Secret: Welfare Mothers tears taste like HONEY!
"To be honest, I support policies to restrict and control who welfare is given to. The only people I know on welfare are exploiting the system so that they do not have to work. All of them have multiple pets as well. While I do believe wholeheartedly that people actually need these services, a bunch of 20something assholes who are perfectly capable of working do not deserve to get benefits to sit around the house smoking weed in front of their children all day. This wont be popular, but I dont know a single person on welfare that isnt knowingly exploiting the system."
 Suspicion-based drug testing.... How do they choose who is Suspicious and who is not?
"Am I the only one here who thinks if you can afford a regular supply of drugs, then you can afford a regular supply of food, therefore you dont need an EBT card in the first place?"
suspicion based testing - isnt that a moniker like walking while black or the Bloomberg stop and frisk fiasco. 
"Plus, all evidence points to such programs costing far more than they save. "
"I think the whole point of the drug testing is to find those who are spending money on drugs... Haha, Im from Flint Michigan, an I know all sorts of people who are poor but are on drugs and trade their food stamps for weed. I know there are many honest people who desperately need help. But government assistance is not something to live on forever. Its to help people get on their feet and go to work. Drugs are not supposed to be in your budget! So those who are abusing their assistance, or doing drugs, need to have consequences. My mom has collected unemployment, government insurance and food stamps, but she got up and got a job and now solely supports me, my brother and her. And we never ate lobster. "
Guilty until proven innocent!
"The rich get richer, the poor get jail."
"Id be up for drug testing of welfare queens: you know, people who benefit from bailouts and corporate tax protections!"
"Did they learn nothing from Florida? This will cost way more than it will save, especially in the long run."
Michigan has a lot of poverty and is trying very hard to develop this industry as an export.
What a fucking waste of time and money. Typical Republican bullshit.
they tried this in Florida and it ended up costing them millions more than it saved. they did it for a year and had 4 people test positive before the federal judges found it unconstitutional. 
"Would they be offered rehab? Probably not. More likely to be unable to land a job, and end up homeless."
"If it passes, I suspect their Governor has been taking halucinogenic substances or missing his sociopathic meds, based on his behavior, and should be the very first Michigan resident to be drug tested. While theyre at it, they might as well run a complete psychiatric examination on him too."

I agree I get drug tested at work. They even shave large patches of hair from our arms and legs. If I have to deal with this to earn money then they can deal with pissing in a cup. Im not against welfare but if I have to follow the law to get paid so should everyone else
"I live in Michigan and I had to be drug tested before I got my minimum wage job. In theory I think this is a good idea because dhs is in a sense paying you whether it be snap, cash benefits, etc. My thought would be that if you test clean, you should be able to be employable, and the state shouldnt have to be a crutch for you to lean on because you are a drug addict. Edit: Phone posted the beginning and hit enter and I couldnt finish the thought. "
"Finally this is brilliant, as a resident of flint nothing makes me more angry then seeing families with brand new clothes and a chrysler 300 paying for their food with food stamps. I hope this eliminates some of the abuse in the system"
"Aside from the fact that this was struck down from florida... Why is this bad? I mean maybe Im an asshole.. but like others have said.. I had to take a wiz test to change oil for $9 an hour or whatever. I had to take a drug test to valet cars. If I wanted to work for the government Id probably need to take a wiz test. I would say charging them with a crime or then searching their homes based on the results is wrong. But if they are receiving public assistance they should follow the same rules that job seekers need to follow. Edit: In response to some other comments that were in the thread... Right I dont need to submit to a test to get hired, but in most cases most national companies, or places that I want to work at usually require it. Its not LAW to have this happen for your job. On the flipside you also dont need to apply for welfare / benefits if you dont want to. "
"Ok lets try this one again. HURR HURR.. its against our rights to be tested and illegally searched to receive benefits. Its my right to do illegal drugs all day and receive public assistance from the taxes paid by folks that in all likely-hood had to get drug tested to get that job to pay into the taxes so that benefits can be paid. THis is a different topic.. but Ive always felt that those who are without jobs and who are receiving public benefits (barring those with kids that need to be taken care of or disabilities) should be providing community service.. Working in soup kitchens, Helping keep the parks clean etc.. do something, gain skills etc to end the assistance, or at least benefit the community thats helping you. edit: feel free to downvote this opposing opinion into oblivion."
"Before I start, let me say that I thoroughly enjoy my recreational drugs and am not some crazy fundamentalist. That said- I think you should be tested for any free handouts (welfare/food stamps/unemployment). If you have so little money that you cant afford to eat or raise your kids, but somehow have money to buy coke, something is messed up there- not to mention that drug use definitely isnt conducive to bettering your situation/getting a job/etc. I also think that the recipient should routinely have to justify ongoing help. How many jobs did you apply for this month? Did you make any effort to educate yourself? Were you not able to find any side jobs in the classifieds while looking for a full-time job? I grew up in a low-income household, but we had pride. Living off of handouts full-time was absolutely not even an option. Taking a job scraping shit off the side of a toilet was less demeaning than living off someone else. Yet now, it seems to be the norm to just expect the government to pay your way through life. To those spouting 4th amendment, that is not the case at all. No one is pulling you out of your house, drug testing you, and then punishing you. Youre asking for free money because of the situation you put yourself in (there are exceptions, but 90% are self-inflicted consequences) and then complaining that you dont get money because there are opiates in your system... I am all about charity, and a government supporting its citizens in need, but when you see the same beggar on the same corner for six months- youve given him money several times, yet every time you see him, he has a bottle of wine in his hand.. you know where your money is going. why keep contributing until he has proven that hes clean and truly wanting to make himself something better? If you ignore this and keep donating out of some blind sense of charity, youre not doing one ounce of good. edit: TIL there are niggers on reddit. not black, but with the same mentality. downvote the guy suggesting that someone goes out and works for a living instead of sponging of the government."
"I mean, I smoked and I agree with this proposal. If you Truly need welfare money, you shouldnt be spending your money on weed. Especially if you live in an illegal/bible belt state and you are paying something like $20 a gram. Im looking at you Georgia!!!"
"I live in Michigan, this needs to pass. If you are on welfare you have no business buying drugs. Im disabled from the Army and dont even get welfare because of the stigma of being grouped in with these people."
"No, Florida did random testing which resulted in expensive tests (price inflated for government contract) administered to clean recipients. Only testing on suspicion increases the odds of catching dirty recipients and more than covers the costs of testing. Again the debate over this. Why should we fund someones habit? Why should children go hungry because the money was spent on drugs? The argument that they are probably too poor to buy drugs is ridiculous. Truly. I work directly with this. If you dont think drugs, sex, alcohol and tobacco are are obtained at a childs expense, you need to get out on the streets and see for yourself. If you believe the welfare system doesnt need a complete overhaul, you shouldnt voice your uneducated/uninformed opinion. If you believe the children will suffer more if we cut the welfare you obviously dont understand they are suffering NOW. I support restriction on available products, no cash system, mandatory sterilization, mandatory termination of high risk or ANY pregnancy conceived after the start of welfare, and mandatory government work programs for the able (and 90% will be able in some form or another). Downvote me to hell, but Ill see all you bleeding hearts there very soon. "
Drug addicts need to eat too. What kind of retards come up with this shit?
"All welfare recipients should require random drug testing periodically as well as require community service if they want a check, period. "
Good
"No offense to the people against this but there are plenty of people abusing the system, and this is the start of catching them. I do agree that after identifying the problem, in this case drugs, there should be another step to help get that person self sufficient. That being said, we dont need more parasites riding the free money whale because they realized getting knocked up a couple times would net them a free pay check."
Whatever Costco pays which is *easily* double. 
"Well only one person actually gave a number so Ill reply to you. You are saying a person with almost no skills doing a job designed for teenagers should earn 30k a year yet the starting salary for a teacher in Florida is 35k, with and avg of 45k. Thus are we saying as a society a teenagers job running a register at Walmart is virtually the same in terms to the pay of a teacher, a person who spent 4 years in college who is tasked with teaching kids? Im going to assume you will say teachers should earn more, thus a starting salary for a teacher would be what? Then we now must adjust all the way down the line commensurate with their experience. Teachers with 20 years in will be at 200k under your scale. "
"Its probably time we stopped talking about wages per se, and started talking about a guaranteed basic income. The sorts of jobs that pay minimum wage are rapidly dwindling."
$50 an hour at a minimum. People deserve **happiness**.
"Enough to pay the bills, at least."
"Starting salary at Costco is around 12-13/hr also Costco is not Walmart. Costco makes the bulk of its income on membership fees, its not a apples to apples comparison thus your comment is moot. "
"In my area Id say a really good employer would pay about $10-12 /hour with overtime allowed, double time on holidays, and possibly a week or so of vacation available."
No. Your assumptions are wrong. Just because you can get a min wage job at 16 doesnt mean there are 16-20 year olds at every position. 
"Minimum of $15/hour, 2 weeks paid vacation, health care, 5 sick days, and 100% match on 401K contributions. "
Have an upvote to counter the downvotes. Its an honest question presented in a non-insulting way. Ill go ahead and answer. I dont know. I do think the current wage is very close to market price for whatever that is worth. Another way of saying that is that I dont believe a monopoly or other form of collusion is artificially keeping wages down for those types of workers.
"What should a 19 year old, 3rd year employee of Walmart running a cash register earn per hour according to reddit? I honestly want to know what you people think. "
A living wage. The current minimum wage is not enough to live on in some areas of the country without assistance.
I think 12-14$ an hour with health insurance is a step in the right direction. It feels like were [subsidizing Walmart](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/dec/06/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-more-walmart-employees-medicaid-/) with the amount of government assistance its employees qualify for.

This is a bullshit story.
Its Newsmax. Of course it is.
so are Minnesotas cities so now that we know what is the same how about we talk about whats different. minnesota increased taxes on the rich and invested in education. wisconsin drastically cut taxes and education spending. minnesota expanded medicare and set up their own exchange. wisconsin did not. minnesota has a surplus now. wisconsin is still in debt. if you want to put a business that has high quality jobs in minnesota you can be confident that you will have a healthy educated workforce and that the state supports this and has the money to do so. wisconsin is cheaper tax wise but businesses will have to shoulder higher medical and education costs. moreso they dont know what will be cut next. minnesota has some of the highest taxes in the country yet businesses seem eager to move and expand here. maybe its because they are providing a robust infrastructure so that companies know that they are getting their moneys worth. both states had different responses to the recession. stimulating the economy seems to me to work better that austerity.
"I think we should follow Minnesotas path. However, from what people have been saying on this thread Wisconsin actually has a surplus this year. Fox news article: http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/01/26/turnaround-1-billion-surplus-wisconsingov-scott-walker-returning-it-taxpayers Wisconsin Rapids Tribune article: http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/viewart/20140121/WRT01/301210292/Democrats-talk-Scott-Walker-about-Wisconsin-surplus &gt; $977 million budget surplus Then again, Politifact says that all states are getting more money due to the recovery from the Great Recession: http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-state-budget-surpl/"

Jim Doyle?s last term, Wisconsin added more than 100,000 jobs and 15,000 businesses during Scott Walkers term. My point was that things arent what they seem. Walker has very little control on the taxes and policies of Milwaukee. And the numbers of NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS in Wisconsin, look that up and see how many of those are from Milwaukee. I love how the author and commentators make recent unemployment claims look like over-all unemployment which is a joke. Take the democrat-dystopia of Milwaukee out of the picture and the state is in great shape. Yes, the stimulus has worked wonders for the American economy! Printing money is the best way to rebound after a depression just ask Prussia and Imperial Germany! Id read more of your bullshit, but my eyes started to bleed. "

"How is it my shit? Several areas in Philadelphia voted 100% for Obama, if something similar happened in another country wed be screaming voter fraud or rigged election, why the double standard?"
"Source? Or are you referencing this viral email: http://www.factcheck.org/2013/01/voting-conspiracies/ In which case youre complaining about 100% of a select 3% population voting for Obama (hint, these were African American neighborhoods who voted Obama at a 93% rate nationally). Youre right about one thing here /u/AaronfromKY - if that had actually happened wed all be screaming voter fraud. Face facts man, its actually *your* team thats up to these shenanigans. If you care as much as you say, show some integrity and call them out rather than desperately cherry-picking for what you wish to be true. /u/gimpbully has a good link for you, why not read that?"
"Trust me, I shake my head everytime I hear a Republican make yet another stupid comment about rape or abortion. I dont agree with much of their ideology either(Im in favor of marijuana legalization, drug decriminalization, gay marriage, and against right wing Christian agenda), but I do want smaller government, more fiscal responsibility in government, and reform. Im far from a ditto head, and wish we would modernize our entire government, from tax code simplification, to actual universal healthcare(why if Obama supposedly is a socialist he didnt press to nationalize the healthcare industry is beyond me), actual school standards(pushing STEM education above all else), and pushing for empirical based laws rather than Judeo-Christian based legal concepts."
"Bring on the down vote party bus. It is past time for the American people to FORCE congress into impeachment processes. To continually go around the system put in place to keep presidents from wielding to much power and dictate what will be done because he thinks it should be is fundamentally wrong. He is also showing clear signs that he is unfit to serve especially on the foreign affairs front. Drawing lines in the sand and then denied he said it. Wont do a dam thing about Russia. He is a serial liar. So, I liked my doctor and insurance, tell me again why I couldnt keep them when we where told repeatedly we could? Yes the president can issue executive orders, but to fundamentally change laws requires congressional steps to be taken. "
Oh. So Obama didnt say we could keep our insurance and doctors we like? What happened there? As I recall he had to tuck his tail between his legs and admit he as wrong. 
"&gt; Bring on the down vote party bus. I havent even read your comment, but okay."
&gt; Bring on the down vote party bus. Gladly 
You dont know the law. You dont understand the law. So why are you using the law as a basis for your argument? Epic fail.
Dude they are going to blast you for telling the truth. 
"Truth huh? The chain email said Obama has issued more than 1,000 executive orders. That?s not even close. As of Jan. 20, 2014, he was at 168. The email also infers that Obama has far surpassed his predecessors in using his executive powers. That, too, is way off. FDR signed off on more than 3,500 executive orders, and, in fact, Obama is on pace to issue fewer executive orders than any two-term president since 1900. As for the 14 executive orders highlighted in the email? Obama didn?t issue any of them. They came from Kennedy, Johnson and Ford. Almost all of them have been revoked. Overall, the statements in this email seem to be completely made up. So we rate its claims Pants on Fire! http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-barack-obama-has-signed-1000-ex/ "
"Did you actually read the article? Mr. Obama?s authority to act comes from his ability as president to revise the rules that carry out the Fair Labor Standards Act, which Congress originally passed in 1938. Mr. Bush and previous presidents used similar tactics at times to work around opponents in Congress. Why is it that there is a segment of the US Population that condemns the current president for doing the same things previous presidents have done. "
I know. Its painful to those who hide their heads in the sand.
"You wouldnt have to worry about downvotes if you had a single valid citation or fact to back up any of your baseless accusations. Since you dont, you sound like a wingnut."
Which amounts to [27.8 million people](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/the-case-for-a-higher-minimum-wage.html?hp&amp;rref=opinion&amp;_r=1).
"&gt; Nevermind that many people on the lower rungs already work 2-3 jobs, no, what they need are more jobs! ...Yet in the unemployment benefit debate theres apparently 100 applicants for every job and nobody can get one even if they wanted... Which of these is true? That the lower rung is working 2-3 jobs or that they cant get jobs? (Yes Im aware theyre not completely mutually exclusive, but were clearly talking about a majority here)"
To clarify: which jobs get 100 applicants? I doubt theyre minmum wage jobs.
"Considering most people in poverty are unemployed, I dont see how raising the minimum wage and making employers more selective will help the unskilled/uneducated."
[This opinion piece explains it well.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/the-case-for-a-higher-minimum-wage.html?hp&amp;rref=opinion&amp;_r=1)
"&gt;People are in poverty because they are not working or not working enough. They need jobs, not an increase in the minimum wage. Nevermind that many people on the lower rungs already work 2-3 jobs, no, what they need are more jobs! Forbes against raising the minimum wage. I am Jacks complete lack of surprise."
"Oh, you mean **the two percent** [who work for the minimum wage](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/08/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-about-2-percent-americans-get-pai/)?"
How about something other than an estimate thats still 3 years away? Of you are going to throw around rhetoric at least make it actual facts not an estimate.
"&gt;In January 2010, before the Affordable Care Act became law, the Congressional Budget Office projected that, in 2016, premiums for bronze plans would, on average, cost ?between $12,000 and $12,500 for family policies.? That estimate has not been updated since. The above is an excerpt from an [article on FactCheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/03/obamacare-to-cost-20000-a-family/) that strikes down a claim based on an IRS document, that a family bronze plan would cost $20,000 per year in 2016."
Holy dicks! Care to provide a source for the $1000 a month plan?
No. http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/foxcanada.asp
I musta got that fact off the Fox News.
Didnt Canada ban Fox News for not qualifying as actual news? It should be like the WWF then they started referring to it as entertainment rather than a sport. Fox News Entertainment has a nice ring to it.
Im sure this isnt exaggeration at all!! 
Every single word he said in his campaign was an outright lie. But I dont think hes lying because hes a bad guy and wanted to fuck over this country the whole time. I believe Obama has a gun to his head. He is being blackmailed. Russ Tice says he saw this first hand while he worked at the NSA: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6m1XbWOfVk
"That argument can be applied to any politician, so we might as well stop caring who we elect."

"Guns are evil? The only gun laws passed under Obama were to allow them in federal parks and at lawful protests. The only gun control law that obama is asking for is increasing background checks. And shockingly, most people already think background checks do everything obama wants them to do. Most people dont realize that there are so many ways around a background check. Both parties are equally lenient on illegals. Amnesty has historically been a republican thing anyways. We wont see this problem taken care of until one side moves to change it so children born of illegals are not citizens. It is a big problem when parents can be deported, but the kids cant be. As for the minimum wage, how can you be against a wage that allows someone to live on it? A wage so low that someone cannot live on is a slave wage. We should not be OK with any business paying out a slave wage. "
"&gt; Guns are evil? The only gun laws passed under Obama were to allow them in federal parks and at lawful protests. Because there was a huge resistance from the 2nd amendment crowd. Most of the strong anti-gun rhetoric comes out of the left. To be fair, however, there are some anti-gun Republicans, and I happen to know a few *staunchly* pro-gun liberals. I dont claim it to be cut and dry across party lines, but it seems to me that most anti-gun folks are left leaning Democrats. &gt; Both parties are equally lenient on illegals. Amnesty has historically been a republican thing anyways. We wont see this problem taken care of until one side moves to change it so children born of illegals are not citizens. It is a big problem when parents can be deported, but the kids cant be. Yeah, historically Id say thats correct. But again, I feel (and this may not be statistically correct) that today, Democrats are pushing for more lenient rules. What really pisses me off is that neither party is placing a big focus on bringing in as many bright foreigners as possible. We need them...now more than ever, but thats getting a bit off topic. &gt; As for the minimum wage, how can you be against a wage that allows someone to live on it? A wage so low that someone cannot live on is a slave wage. We should not be OK with any business paying out a slave wage. [2.6% of workers earn minimum wage](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/08/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-about-2-percent-americans-get-pai/). Its a small number. You can argue that there is a significant percentage of people who earn between minimum wage and a figure that is higher, but still not good, but ultimately its still a small number. Furthermore, many of these people are between 16 and 24, meaning theyre working part time or living with family. The focus needs to be on what policy action the country can take to foster an environment that creates more, better paying jobs. We also have to consider that a minimum wage hike could harm small businesses. People love to say McDonalds should pay their employees more because they are a large corporation, but many people dont realize that a.) those stores are franchises (small businesses) and b.) they operate on razor thin margins. Im not saying that the discussion to raise minimum wage shouldnt be had, but it also shouldnt be at the front and center of the discussion on how to improve the economy. "
"&gt; it seems to me that most anti-gun folks are left leaning Democrats. I see much more on the left about responsible gun ownership than on the right. On the right, they seem to want zero rules about guns and dont want to be held accountable if they are negligent. &gt;What really pisses me off is that neither party is placing a big focus on bringing in as many bright foreigners as possible. We need them...now more than ever, but thats getting a bit off topic. I would say the opposite is true. I work in a place where we have lots of people on work visas working. I know of someone who worked at an engineering firm in chicago where almost everyone was a foreigner on a work visa and they were doing engineering work on some government facility in los alamos. Work visas are out of hand and they are 100% displaying american workers. Engineering is quickly become less in demand purely because of the foreign labor force taking jobs so college grads cannot get hired. &gt;2.6% of workers earn minimum wage. That is 2.6% of workers earning $15,080 or less. A horribly misleading statistics. It excludes people who work extra hours to boost their pay, people who make near minimum wage such as $7.26, and people who get paid more purely because of tips, despite the fact that their employer is only paying them 15,080 a year @ 40 hours. Honestly I think 2.6% is damn high considering how narrow his statistic was. "
Good enough for staffers but not Congress and the Pres? Youre gonna love it!
"If you read &gt;Congress and their staffers to mean staffers but not Congress, im not sure proof will change your mind, but [what the heck.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/14/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-obama-just-granted-all-congress-/) As for the pres: Obama and members of his administration and their families will continue to get their health insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. But its not their own plan; its the same plan that covers millions of other federal employees. In other words, they will be like most Americans who get their health insurance through an employer -- nothing will change.

We live in a neighborhood a couple of miles from Wright Patterson Airforce base. We are surrounded by hard core republican neighbors...we dont discuss politics with them. Our neighbors are so anti-tax that they have failed to pass school levies multiple times even though the neighborhood schools are overcrowded and have already cut tons of services (i.e, busing for high school students, art and music classes for elementary students, AP and other language classes at the high school, etc.). Their excuse...we send our kids to private/Catholic schools, so why should we pay higher property taxes. It makes me sick...they just care about their own pocketbooks and have no sense of community and responsibility towards their fellow man. On the other hand, Kucinich is from Ohio..."

"OP, looking at his district map [(and election record)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio%27s_8th_congressional_district), it can be seen that he can get re-elected easily. There was not even a candidate than ran against him last election. Furthermore, even if the map boundaries are changed that area of Ohio is so conservative that it would not matter much. And to heap more onto that fact, many on the far right consist of that 37% that fault both Obama and the democrats outright, even though the ACA is law. So the problem is about our broken two party system as much as it is about any single person. And why many think that term limits might be a good idea."

"My argument is that there are reportedly enough Republicans to support a clean CR and eliminate the entire shutdown (not just a piecemeal approach). But Boehner isnt allowing the vote. Even if the reports are false, at least he would give the vote a chance."
"Can you work on getting rid of Kasich? I dont know what it is about OH governors, but there was Voinivich, and now Kasich. Add in people like Boehner... wow. It is almost like OH is trying to balance out having Sherrod Brown, Kusinich, and even Glenn."
"There is no need to apologize for Boehner, Its not your fault. They run wrapped in the Flag, talking about apple pie, family values etc.. The problem is they lie to get elected. And they lie for the rest of their lives and what they dont tell you is that theyre well paid to lie. "

"Find a local group of dedicated, passionate people who have some time to dedicate during election season, set up an online presence to make yourselves seem bigger than you are (Reddit can help with that), get yourselves on the local news a few times protesting for something popular in your area--treat veterans with respect, support small business owners, something that will perk up the ears of locals, something which seems Republican but also something you can hit Boehner on eventually--, and then contact with DNC for assistance. The idea is to set up a local insurgence within Ohios 8th. Note that theres no way that a district thats been red for like 80 years is going to suddenly go blue, that has to be a longer strategy, but if Boehner can be portrayed as a wishy-washy, compromised politician, he could find that hes vulnerable from the libertarian right. Im sure in Ohio you can find a good-looking, youngish veteran businessman, someone conservative but less neocon and more libertarian, who can make Boehner look decrepit and corrupt in comparison. Republicans love the whole pure of heart warrior makes good trope. Boehners actual record is something that can be used against him, too. [He lies a lot](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/john-boehner/), hes a corporatist, he very often undermines core Republican principles, Ted Cruz is fracturing the party because of Boehners failed leadership, hes kinda a big pussy, and hes made Ohios 8th into a laughing stock. If you can make him look like the liability he is to the GOP, if you can make it seem like he was given the reigns of the ship and hes run aground, and if you can have a superior replacement waiting in the wings, Boehner might have to come home and actually campaign for the first time since he was elected in the 90s. If he starts really campaigning, you know you will have had an effect on things, and thats when you start pushing for a debate. "

"no worries, im still mad at canada, they gave us cruz. what did we ever do to you canada :P"
I agree.
you should be proud to have someone standing up for individual rights...The ACA is forcing people to purchase a private commodity that profits private corporations.

"During Primaries, can I generally vote for which Republican I think would be a better Republican representative (to help vote out the Republican I think would be a bad choice), while still voting for the party that I want? Let me rephrase the question: Im asking if, during a Republican Primary, can I vote out the Republican that I believe is a bad choice and still be able to vote for say a Democrat vs the winner of that Republican Primary, in two separate elections? So far, I have only showed up to the polls to cast my ballot during the actual election (and only showed up to vote for the primaries if it was my party alone), and never once considered showing up at an opposing parties primary to vote for the Republican candidate that I think might deserve the chance better than the Tea Party candidate. It only just occurred to me now if Im able to do so, except I dont know if thats what they call voter fraud or not."
Congratulations! You have been brainwashed into thinking it is one side or the other who caused this mess. Either side could have compromised if they actually cared. Neither did. 
"Nope, just staring at the headlines that state Boehner wont put the CR up for vote, despite growing reports that it will now pass. Also, the House of Reps passed the ACA years ago. THAT was when this negotiation stuff was suppose to happen. Its too late."
"So no plans to extradite him out of Texas, huh?"

"....Theres no way this is a serious post, right?"
"No need to apologize, he passed a bill funding the government. "
Your state disagrees with you; they have chosen the best representative of the state. Ohios best is Boehner.
"Boehner has **one vote** so... +434 other votes make up the House WAAY better than Harry Reids Senate where they dont debate, **dont vote at all** If the Senate **simply voted** (against/defeated the House bill), wed have a very different tomorrow ...pressure would shift 100% on to Boehner"
"Im sure that you have an obamaphone, obamawelfare, obamaabortion obamafoodstamps obamataxbreaks (i heard that the next thing is obamaplasmatv) Now if only you would get off your ass and pay for it."
But I love you fellow Americans. Please vote for me!
"Im not understanding why people hate him so much. If the aca was the original bill without the changes and subsidies a lit of people said they wouldnt be bothered by it. The shutdown was caused by both parties. Also, the house has tried to compromise repeatedly...no matter how stupid it was. Its Obama who is saying over and over I will not compromise. And on another aspect if the shutdown...why is it so hard to put forth a legitimate budget? Thats another reason for the shutdown. Obamas budget was rejected by everyone on both sides. There HAS to be compromise."
"The ACA was a bill three years ago. The House of Reps voted it into law, same with Senate. That was three years ago -- all the negotiations and compromises were taken care of then. The Supreme Court held up the law as constitutional. Its implementation time. House Repubs are too late. Regarding the budget, Reid gave up a sequester fight to avoid Boehners ACA fight. But House Repubs reneged and demanded more concessions. This shutdown is squarely in Boehners court. And if reports are accurate, theres enough Republican support to end this entire shutdown right now, instead of continuing trying to piecemeal part of the government into gear."
"I went to a Catholic school, too. And? Why would you get flamed for that?"
"From the same high school that Boehner attended, the same catholic high school. Im not sorry. And no this district will never vote blue, ever. But then again Ill get flamed for going to a catholic school. You guys never cease to amaze me. "

"A little late to the party here, but I figured Id chime in with my $0.02. I live in Boehners district. In fact, he lives about five minutes away from me. I dont agree with his politics, but him and his wife are pretty nice people. The reason I bring this up is mainly to say that these politicians are still people, and we should see them as such. Hes representing this district, which is very conservative and very partisan. Most of the people here are not issue voters, but pretty much side with their party. Also, Gerrymandering, while it is a problem, isnt as big as people make it out be on this sub-reddit. It doesnt necessarily guarantee seats. Off of the top of my head, depending on the state, it makes a +/- 0.25%-2.15% difference. I wish I had access to my notebook so I could link to the original article that outlines that. I myself am very left on social issues and center-left on fiscal issues. The fact of the matter is that Boehner painted himself into a corner and is now dealing with a caucus that can basically hold a gun to his head. The reason he got the Speakership in the first place is because hes legendary for his fund raising ability, albeit also having a reputation for being a wine-pounding, cigar-smoking a-hole. Id be surprised if he kept his Speakership for more than the next cycle, and if hes not retired by 2016 or 2018 at the latest."

"You know, the next thing Obama can do is mandate a 1 size fits all pair of pants for everybody or people face an another tax. Sound like a good idea to you?"
"lets separate the facts then: Obama says millions are uninsured in the USA (my claim) We are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured, he said in a June 2009 speech before the American Medical Association. Later that year at a town hall, he promised that if youre one of the nearly 46 million people who dont have health insurance, you will finally have quality, affordable options. Obama said Im not going to walk away from 40 million people who have the chance to get health insurance for the first time. Can you aknowalge these quotes are True?

"But where we are at is 1-1.5 % above the number insured in 2008, so far there (ACA for 4 years) is a net loss of health insurance in the USA http://www.gallup.com/poll/167393/uninsured-rate-drops-far-first-quarter-2014.aspx and according to some studies, that is just because ACA signed more up for Medicare http://washingtonexaminer.com/modest-obamacare-reforms-insured-more-people-than-massive-system-overhaul/article/2546551"
"you do remember Obama telling us 7 million needed insurance? then, of course, over 5 million got their coverage canceled, and again 6 mill sign ups means only 4 mill paid, so do the math and see that the number of people in the US needing insurance has gone up because of ObamaCare *good times*"
There has been no net loss of insured Americans since the passage of the ACA: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/18/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-more-people-are-uninsured-obamac/

"Already have the House. Already have the Supreme Court. Take back the Senate? Likely 2014. Need 5 seats, the projection is 6. If any of the liberal SC justices retire after that, youll either replace them with a moderate or theyll be blocked. Lots of millionaire money is available now that wasnt just a week ago to help us make this happen. Take back the White House? Very decent Chance in 2016. Especially after the ObamaCare delayed provisions kick in. You know, the ones Obama moved until *after* the 2014 election because he is afraid of the backlash due to their negative effects. Plus, again lots of millionaire money is available now that wasnt just a week ago to help us make this happen too. But the Senate has a filibuster? Screw that. Harry Reid already put a big crack in it, well just rip it out the rest of the way once we have the Senate. At this point, well be able to do any fucking thing we want to. But well be nice, you can keep the Mayors office in Detroit. Have fun running that liberal shithole."
"You are changing the quantifier, I was responding to his statement of: &gt;Republicans have staunchly refused to consider any jobs bills and have ignored all attempts to submit them, including from the White House and Senate.

There was even a study some republican group put together to try and say a fact check site, either politifact or factcheck, was bias because they had a higher percentage of articles showing republicans lie. The total number of fact checks was higher for republicans, and the percentage of lies vs truth in those checks was higher. In other words, even republican groups dont argue what youre trying to argue. They accept fact checks show Republicans lie more, they are going with the they are biased defense. "
Remember that Obama is equally as dishonest. 
"&gt;The government shut down 12 times under Tip ONeill Those were normal budget squabbles.

But some called Obamas decision to not defend the law in court unprecedented as well. Im not talking about laws, Im talking about funding. As I recall, the ACA was passed in the dead of night and only hours after being introduced. The fact is that I can point to Pelosis we need to pass it quote and you can only resort to name-calling.

What about the black kid who shot the white Australian in OK because he was bored? Point being, Both cases have nothing to do with race. Pathetic parenting is to be blamed, not race. In any case, we live in a scary time where Government will now have full control of our healthcare (Which thanks to Obama,Congress wont have to take part in but they still insist that its the best program for everybody else), our government lies to us on a daily basis about our Spying Program, we actively recruit people for food stamps and the list can go on. Our Government is getting too large and they want us to depend on them which is pretty scary when you think of it. My point, Im 25 years old and pay $800/week in taxes but cant afford my own dental bills and have a long way to go to pay off my college loans. Im tired of supporting lazy AMERICANS. Race has nothing to do with this or my comment. The bottom line is if you take some pride in yourself, work hard, and you will never fail or have to depend on our government. As far as Race is concerned, I dont give a fuck if you are white, black, yellow or red. If you work hard, you will never fail."

Thanks but it seems to support my previous comment that this all stemmed from Cathys beliefs but it does seem the money came from Chick-Fil-As charitable foundation.
Interesting. From what I understood it was him talking about his support at an interview with a Christian media company. Do you have any article links for that?

Such an obvious fraud must have been reported. No link? No proof?

http://origin.factcheck.org/Images/image/FederalDeficit(1).jpg Check out the Bill Clinton years in blue.
"http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/ But even if we remove Social Security from the equation, there was a surplus of $1.9 billion in fiscal 1999 and $86.4 billion in fiscal 2000. http://www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment.html Under the current unified budget rules, the government reported a surplus of $3.2 billion for FY 1969. Removing the off-budget items from the calculation would result in a net deficit of $507 million."
"Its not really correct to look at it in terms of raw surplus. You have to account for GDP growth as well. For example, if you have 2% a year in deficit, but your GDP growth is 4% your debt level is actually falling fast. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FederalDebt1940to2012.svg"
Hence the real.
"Well thats obviously truth, but I would expect we should be capable of leveling off more often than not. I mean, its not like were pampered for such a rich country."
"After a quick Googling, it seems the last real surplus was in 1969."
"According to the internet: Clinton did not have a surplus of $230B in the year 2000 because he had to borrow $246.5 From numerous other off budget funds. Clinton NEVER ran a surplus during his 8 years in office, he just borrowed yearly from different budgets, (primarily the SS budget) to offset the general fund losses. In 2000 the following funds were borrowed which resulted in a $16.5 deficit. The last time the federal government ran a true suplus was 1969, the total surplus was $3.2B and before that was $1960, $.3 B "
"after a quick googling, it seems the last time we had no debt was 1838"
"2001, actually"
How could a $10.10 minimum wage help workers make ends meet? Months of Rent: California - .14 months of rent. LOL Texas - 6.21 months. Not if you live in Austin

Yes! 
"Obama called for raising the minimum wage. Obama called for closing Guantanamo. Obama called for cutting college tuition. Obama called for increased protections for whistleblowers. Obama called for enforcing net neutrality. Following this logic, it would appear that wages are about to take a nosedive."

"Doubling of people on food stamps: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/19/tom-cole/rep-tom-cole-says-food-stamp-spending-doubled-unde/ ... And the number of people on Food stamps doubled under Bush too. Its a side effect of being in a recession, which we entered before Obama was sworn in, and before he had chance to implement any of his own policies. Edit to add: The US Govt will be out of GM by the end of the year, and has sold 2/3rds of its stock in the company. The govt does not own any of Chrysler, and hasnt since June 2011. Note that both companies came to the Govt asking for a bailout; the govt didnt demand it."
"You are simply wrong. The president is a socialist who cannot do everything he wants in a single step. That is why he introduced the Affordable Care Act which is not single payer but will, if allowed to stand, eliminate the medical insurance industry and resolve to single payer. He did take over the operation of GM and Chrysler. That is no a capitalist act, it is a socialist act. He has doubled the number of people on food stamps and he has been using unemployment as an alternate welfare program by extending it indefinitely. He has suppressed the economy until people are using disability as an alternate welfare program. He is forcing people on welfare by subsidizing their health care insurance costs. You pretend that you dont understand that. Obamacare subsidizes health care to many who had no subsidization (or need for it) prior to Obamacare. This is another form of welfare he is promoting daily. He is controlling the medical insurance companies through the ACA. Everything he does has the goal of increasing dependency on the government with the eventual result of complete dependency on the government. He does not even try to hide his socialism. He is proud of it."
The Affordable Care Act is destroying the best medical care in the world. That was its purpose and it is accomplishing its purpose. There needs to be no alternative. Simply repealing it and allowing our system to return to the prior state will be a vast improvement.
Yes. The USA had the highest infant mortality rate in the developed world. Clearly the system was great as it was and didnt need changing! 
"Yeah, except of course thats complete and utter bullshit according to every survey basically. We do good ER (Which we basically have too since its the only form of Healthcare a huge chunk of people even had access too simply because hospitals were forced to take them) and heart surgery. Were more than double the expenses of the next closest nations and most nations can see their doctors more often to boot for substantially less with the same or better results."
What we had prior was the best system in the world? Include data with an affordability weightng
"Try 37th best in the world http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/14/paul-hipp/rocker-viral-video-mocks-us-37th-best-health-care-/ The U.S. had the worst healthcare of any industrialized first world nation. The old system sucked and needed reform, so we went with the conservative plan as a compromise and ditched the public option. Now american conservatives are calling it socialism and american liberals are defending the conservative version of universal health care. The Republicans got their version of healthcare they originally wanted, the only reason theyre complaining is that it was implemented by Obama and not them. Its all politics."
Tell that to the people that could not get insurance and did not have real insurance. The reason medical care did not change was the decision makers have insurance paid for by someone else and those at the bottom dont and cant afford it. Yea that is a great system. I work for a company that is close to the top off the Fortune 100 list and they are making us pay for some of our insurance for the first time. 
The ACA is not a conservative plan. It is a socialist plan. It was passed in congress with socialist votes and not a single conservative vote. Dont lie.
&gt;I work for a company that is close to the top off the Fortune 100 list and they are making us pay for some of our insurance for the first time. Thank Obamacare for that. Watch your cost continue to rise and thank Obamacare for that too. Most of the people who signed up for Obamacare already had insurance before Obamacare. The remainder are mostly people with preexisting conditions who were on the states insurance for uninsurables. The people who are losing big time are people who had insurance before Obamacare and are losing their insurance.

Walmart employee here. I can confirm poorness
"Am I the only one here who thinks If you need more money, learn a marketable skill or get a second job?"
"This isnt just Walmart though, infact most other retailers pay less than Walmart at least in my area. I was with Staples for 2 years in computer sales then went to Walmart for cashier and made more money."
How do we get this to the front page? This is sickening that the 3rd wealthiest company in the world causes such a burden for tax payers. The company obviously can easily to make all their jobs decent paying with good benefits but the Walton family is just too damn selfish to help society. How better off would this country be if all those employees made a decent livable wadge?
Real Title: People who want to raise the minimum wage say we should raise the minimum wage.
"The study seems off, since it is not looking at the marginal affect, instead just summing up the workers times benefit costs. A better answer would come from looking to some assessment of benefit use before and after a Wal-Mart opens in a community, to see if the workers consumed more or less public benefits after Wal-Mart came to town. It would be harder to do, obviously, but would get at the real issue: 1. By driving out higher wage employers and small businessmen, Wal-Mart increases those on the dole. 2. By giving jobs to those who are not employed Wal-Mart decreases reliance on public assistance. There is the separate question of whether Wal-Mart could survive without public assistance, be because its employees would otherwise starve, succumb to the elements or die without adequate medical care, but Im not sure how to test that hypothesis. "
"Everybody should watch the documentary Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price. It was made circa 05 and mentions this exact issue. Wal-Mart treats their employees like shit (e.g. wages, benefits, etc.), which is one of the factors that allows them to lower their prices. This, in turn, increases the need for entitlement program coverage (e.g. food stamps) among other things. And we all know who carries the bill for that spending, the government (but really the American taxpayer pays the bill because... THE GOVERNMENT IS FUNDED BY US!)! People think theyre getting a deal by going to Wal-Mart, but in reality, their local economy is taking a hit, their taxes increase, their standard of living goes down, and no matter how convenient Wal-Mart is, its an eyesore and should cease to exist. Good day."
Tescos in Britain is just the same. They make huge profits and pay peanuts expecting the taxpayer to top up workers wages so they can eat.
"I always get down voted for pointing this out, but the biggest benefactor from Walmarts cheap food and goods is low income families. Their clientele is not wealthy people. Raising the salary for unskilled workers is doable, but the costs would be passed on to the consumer. That would jam up Walmarts (or McDonalds, or 7/11) business model, which relies on cheap labor to provide cheap commodities. "
Save money. Live better. 
Wal-Marts business model has always been predicated on dumping as much of their own personnel costs on the government as possible. Its basically just one gigantic welfare scam. But youll never hear conservatives do anything less than sing praises to their business genius while demonizing the very welfare their business relies upon.
"What does this have anything to do with Walmart? Because they employ a good amount of people? Im not exactly a fan of walmart, been employed by them for 3 years now, but I am not going to agree with this crap article. They dont even hire people on at minimum wage, they hire usually a dollar or so over that, not much. But what about all the other shops or stores that hire AT minimum wage or lower under the table? Just easier to pin the blame on an already hated figure."
"Would be interested to see how much people on lower incomes save from a Wal Mart as well. Dont get me wrong, they suck. But this is only one side of the coin."
For anyone interested in reading the [actual study](http://democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/sites/democrats.edworkforce.house.gov/files/documents/WalMartReport-May2013.pdf)
"The republicans like to tell you that anyone on welfare or food stamps are lazy people and if they just got a job their problems would be fixed. This, of course, is bullshit. No person should be working a full time job and not be making enough money to cover their living expenses. WalMart is one of the most profitable corporations in the world and they take advantage of the system far more than any individual could. Wanna cut government spending? Raise the minimum wage to a living wage. "
"$900,000 a year is nothing. There are bigger battles to fight."
"Why blame Wal-Mart alone when the issue appears to be minimum wage? Most companies that higher people for an entry level position where no experience is needed offer the lowest amount of money they can in an area, which is generally minimum wage or close to it."
"So is there a scale we can apply to Walmart shopping, i.e. I spent 20 dollars (and sold my soul by going into) at wallmart but after factoring in the money out of my check in taxes I spent $30? "
It really sucked the first time Walmart forced me to both work and shop there...oh wait... I havent set foot in a Walmart in probably 5 years and dont plan on it anytime soon. People just need to put their money where their mouth is. 
"LOL thats what, 0.000001% of the national budget? "
"And some people think America has a capitalist system. What we really have is socialism-for-the-rich-and-a-giant-fuck-you for everyone else. Or, if you prefer, [corporatism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism)."

"We dont want your regulation, but well take your money."
"Its almost funny how fucked we are (wage wise anyway) and even educated discourse on the matter glosses over some important repercussions of the solutions being offered. Trade Walmart for whatever evil business youd like. Walmart wont put a store up and continue to operate it where it is going to see a net loss. If a Walmart is profitable, it is by definition a fiscal drain on the community that it is a part of. This effect can be compounded when you consider the effect of low wages discussed in the article. Draining more local, state and federal dollars through social safety net programs that their employees are forced to use. So how do we fix this? Some people think its done by forcing Walmart to pay employees enough to live on. Well, if you increase the costs for Walmart to operate in a community, one of two things is likely to happen: either the store in community A is no longer profitable and must be shut down, forcing people to drive 30 miles to community B to get lower cost goods. Sucking tax dollars and jobs out of community A and more money out of those peoples pockets via vehicle and travel costs. Or you drive the costs of goods up to maintain store profitability. Making the extra dollars earned less powerful. Im not an economist, but this is obviously a complicated problem. No regulation doesnt work and well meaning but stupid regulation doesnt work either. Im afraid that pinning our hopes on well crafted and well intentioned legislation at this point in history is a pipe dream. TL;DR: Im cynical and not offering a solution."
Though the study assumes that most workers who qualify for the public assistance programs do take advantage of them... 
"I dont understand why we are singling out Walmart. The real issue is the minimum wage isnt high enough for people to live off of, so they need government help. Raising the minimum wage solves this problem."
How is this even legal? Here in Australia a company pulling that kind of stunt would be in huge trouble with all sorts of Government and social agencies.
"every year the benefits get smaller and the cost for them gets higher,no vision and dental is though deta denial which is based in Arkansas and really only covers the basic of dental work. Also i would like to point out that Medical from walmart is thou blue cross of Arkansas"
And just how much money would be cost by all those people simply not having any jobs at all?
Its a chicken and egg problem If these government assistance programs did not exist in the first place employees would not be able to work at Walmart for ridiculously low wages and therefore Walmart would not be able to find workers. So Walmart would be forced to raise the wages
"Holy shit?! Your min wage is some ~$7.5?! How do you even convince people to get a job? I know the danish economy is alot different (+40% income tax, 25% sales tax), but our min wage is something like just below $20/hr if you are more than 18 yo, regulated each year by inflation. - The first ~$8-9k you earn per year is tax free."
nothing will be done by anyone.
"Unfortunately there are some people who base their opinions on misconceptions rather than the facts, Buchanan said, noting that 75 percent of Walmart managers started as hourly employees. Every month more than 60 percent of Americans shop at Walmart and we are proud to help them save money on what they want and need to build better lives for themselves and their families. We provide a range of jobs -- from people starting out stocking shelves to Ph.D.?s in engineering and finance. We provide education assistance and skill training and, most of all, a chance to move up in the ranks. - she just used statistics to her advantage in a corporate tirade. 75% of managers started out as hourly employees - most people at a manager skill level arent looking to go there so they promote the successful within. Congrats. That makes a low wage look better. Hi would you like to make 15 dollars an hour as a manager instead of 8? Regardless of the situation that person would say yes. Now, someone working at a medical practice making 14.50 an hour... is not going to be interested in that. More than 60% of Americans shop here every month - well considering youve closed most mom and pop shops, and regional stores are barely hanging on, it makes sense when you have a non membership store (aka free) that offers low Prices (on somethings) Range of jobs - we have a lot of one and one of the other. The last sentence is just bullshit sprinkles. "
I work for target and a good half of my coworkers are on food stamps. Its not just walmart. Its all shit jobs that wish they could pay you less than minimum wage.

Low skills job generally pay low wages. Why is this news? 
This is what happens when you provide a safety net. Companies just take the cost of those basic necessities out of their workers pay.
There needs to be a obligation on companies to disclose what they pay v a living wage in a given area that doesnt necessitate handouts
"They also operate in several states to avoid massive amounts of taxes, which while nothing new in the corporate world, is another form of tax money the company costs us in addition to its workers being on benefits from unlivable wages."
"Well lookee here,,,is that a welfare queen I see?"
You know what the funny thing about Walmart is? No one is forcing people to work there. No one is forcing people to shop there. Crazy.
"WalMart wines-and-dines politicians, gets tax-breaks to locate their giant store at the edge of town - for undeveloped regions gets the taxpayers to foot the bill for getting roads, sewers, power, etc. out to their location, then opens up and puts all the mom-and-pop stores out of business and pays poverty wages that require the taxpayers to subsidize their employees with food stamps and medicare, etc. ... Wal-Mart is an abomination in so many ways"
"What ever happened to the Democratic party that stood for individual liberties and the little guy? Now its all about big government, corporations, and high taxes...."
"Misleading title. It is 900,000 per year at just the one store the looked at. There is more than one store."
"If the government had a problem with walmart paying minimum wage, they should raise the minimum wage. Since the government doesnt want to raise the minimum wage, you have to ask yourself, why are you voting for these people? I dont know who you should vote for, but It sure isnt anyone in power now."
"FTFY One Walmarts Low Wages Could Cost Taxpayers $900,000 Per Year, Allege Union-Funded Democrat Liars"
What a clever and backwards way of blaming Walmart instead of the ridiculous social programs that allow people to continue working at jobs like this while living off of taxpayers dollars. Asinine article. 
"Walmarts wages arent the reason for people being on food stamps and welfare. A government and society that keeps increasing benefits and lowering eligibility to qualify for benefits is the reason these people are on them. Also, the fact that many of these low income people who work at Walmart are also single moms who through their own poor decisions had children before they were financially stable. Now that they have kids they qualify for more benefits. Its not a coincidence that since 2008 there are millions more on welfare, food stamps, unemployment and disability. Some really need it, but many are on it because government simply relaxed the criteria to qualify for benefits"
"Heres a shocker, unskilled labor makes shit for pay, dems attack Wal-Mart because the unions want to get a foothold in their stores. Sorry if youre unskilled labor you dont deserve $18/hour as a cashier, let it go assholes. Just another political party doing what they are paid to do. "
"Or, you know.. maybe not. Its almost like reddit is sponsored by a small group of liberal blogs. Im a liberal myself, but I recognize misleading stories when I see them."
This is a problem of minimum wage being too low to live on. Raise minimum wage and Walmart is legally obligated to pay a decent wage... What motivation do they have to hand out more money otherwise?!? 
"Theres this Doc about walmart on how their low prices = the savings getting put onto tax payers because they disallow worker unions and cut every possible benifit and pay to their emplooyes/ They pocket every dime in profit. Which as earned the walmart family among the top 10% of the U.S.A Basically, if you shop Walmart, youre a flipping nazi whos helping hurt this country.. No pun intended or jokes intended."
"Pretty sure its more than 900,000 they dont offer their employees good enough health care, and tell them to go get state healthcare or Medicare and mooch off the system. And they pay the employees so poorly they can barely afford food and need food stamps. There are tons of documentaries, some on Netflix and there are a good amount of studys regarding these topics too "
"I hate to rain on the parade here. But I mean, when your job entirely consists of bagging groceries, or stocking shelves, etc., can you really stand up and complain about I DONT MAKE ENOUGH MONEY FOR MY WORK!!!! Seriously, you could train a monkey to work a register or push carriages. Being a low tier worker at a supermarket is about as unskilled as labor gets. Frankly, and Im sorry if this sounds blunt, but while there are many reasons to hate Walmart(my first job was there, trust me, i know), not dolling out tons of dough to someone who stands in one place and swipes bar codes across a scanner all day is NOT one of them. PS: Yes I made my first account to post this. "
"Im so sick of fucking Wallmart. They are the absolute worst for the economy... Edit: the word fucking here is intended as an adjective to describe their shittyness and not a verb, just in case there was any confusion."
Isnt it amusing how we always manage to subsidize the wealthy? But why not? Theyre just such valuable people.
This subreddit is awash in stupidity. 
"$900,000 per year is about $0.006 per taxpayer. I would be willing to bet that the low wages have saved me more than $0.006 on Walmarts prices!"
How much does one make working at Walmart 38hrs a week?
Walmart is evil. Period.
"I think history has proven any company that focuses mainly on the stock holder, over the basic general welfare of the employee, eventually fails."
"Misleading story with an agenda. However, I believe a single person making minimum wage should be making enough so that they dont qualify for assistance. If minimum wage isnt enough to keep people from depending on government then whats the point? Also, wouldnt most companies benefit from having consumers with more money in their pockets? Making people depend on government means money that could be going directly back into the private sector is being siphoned off in overhead and waste. Im not talking about making people rich for stocking shelves, but for moral and practical reasons, no one willing to work a full-time job should be unable to support themselves. "
"What surprises me most here is the number of hardline Walmart supporters in this thread. This is a company that cashed life insurance policies it took out on its oldest and sickest employees - specifically because it was profitable for them to do so. Walmart is evil, through and through. "
"What a stupid study. Blaming walmart for people being on welfare? Lets look at it bit by bit. &gt;Walmart wages are so low that many of its workers rely on food stamps and other government aid programs to fulfill their basic needs But without their Walmart job they would require even more assistance correct? &gt;Though the study assumes that most workers who qualify for the public assistance programs do take advantage of them So, some who qualify for the programs manage to get by on their evil walmart salary and dont take advantage of said programs? &gt;According to the report, Walmart had more workers enrolled in the state?s public health care program in the last quarter of last year than any other employer, with 3,216 people enrolled. When the dependents of those workers were factored in, the number of enrollees came to 9,207. Could that be because Walmart is the largest private employer in the state of Wisconsin? http://worknet.wisconsin.gov/worknet/largemp.aspx &gt;When low wages leave Walmart workers unable to afford the necessities of life, taxpayers pick up the tab, When no wages leave workers unable to afford the necessities of life taxpayers pick up an even larger tab. &gt;After accounting for the total number of Walmart stores and employees across the state and the per-person costs of BadgerCare, as the state?s health care program is known, the reports authors estimated that the cost of publicly funded health care comes to $251,706 per year for a 300-employee Supercenter. So they simply count the number of people working at walmart and multiply that by the per person cost of the state health care plan? And this is considered a legitimate study? Because they know the headline is all that matters. &gt;The authors then added up the projected costs of other public-assistance programs available to families on BadgerCare... Assuming all those workers avail themselves of those additional programs -- granted, an unlikely scenario -- the report extrapolates that the final tab would top $900,000. Ok, lets rewrite this headline to fit the actual study. If every single walmart employee at a 300 person store received every single state welfare benefit offered, it could cost $900,000. &gt;In response to the report, Walmart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company was proud of the opportunities it provides for employees... noting that 75 percent of Walmart managers started as hourly employees. Wait, what? you mean Walmart actually provides not only jobs but opportunity for better jobs? &gt;The report, entitled The Low-Wage Drag on Our Economy, was produced by Democrats with the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is chaired by Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.). Good to see congress finally producing something useful. I wonder how much this crap study costs taxpayers? &gt;The labor policies of Walmart, and those of companies that emulate its low-road approach, end up leaving taxpayers holding the bag, Miller said in a statement. Maybe if we cut taxes low-road companies could afford to pay a higher wage? What kind of profit margin do you think evil walmart makes on average? Would you believe 3.5% in 2012? http://ycharts.com/companies/WMT/profit_margin &gt;Critics have long denounced Walmart for paying such low wages that many workers are forced to take advantage of public-assistance programs like food stamps or Medicaid. If the wages are so bad why are they working at Walmart? Does Walmart chain these people to the registers? Why dont they just go get better jobs? Whats that? They cant find an employer willing to pay more than Walmart? And Walmart is the bad guy? &gt;The Congressional reports timing is no accident. Miller, along with Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), has sponsored legislation that would raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 Now its not a study but a report... with an agenda. &gt;Democrats have argued that boosting the minimum wage would help pull some workers off of these programs &gt;Aubretia Edick, a Massachusetts woman who earns $11.70 an hour and receives public assistance, food stamps, Section 8 housing, and state-funded health care, Now Im not sure why they included this... 1. She works at Walmart and is making 1.5x minimum wage (I thought walmart was evil and didnt give out paychecks?) 2. Above even what they want to set the new minimum wage to and still on every assistance known to man. (I thought raising the minimum wage to 10.10 was so people wont need assistance?) &gt;?Walmart doesnt pay my salary,? she said. ?You pay my salary.? Then why work at Walmart? &gt;When she started working for Walmart, she said, she had expectations that have since proved unattainable. ?I thought I could make it on my own,? she said. That didnt happen.? And that is Walmarts fault how again? "
"Where are these Wal Marts that are holding guns to skilled laborers heads and forcing them to accept jobs for low wages with no benefits? If thats happening somewhere, someone should do something. Thats called kidnapping, or perhaps slavery. However, it seems that what is being discussed is having the government hold guns to successful business owners heads and force the, to pay more that a service is worth. Thats called extortion or perhaps robbery. This is precisely why I despise liberal thinking and labor unions...always wanting to force someone to raise the reward for no corresponding increase in skill or effort. If you want higher compensation, raise your qualifications. If you are not satisfied with what a company will pay you, dont work there. So long as there are folks willing to take the job for that pay, thats what theyll pay. If they cant attract employees with that pay, theyll have to raise it. Better yet, if you think its such a failed business model, YOU go build one. See if the federal government lets you....or if you drown in regulation and taxes that youve screamed for them to impose."
"Id also like to point out that while [Walmart is known for having a large number of employees that rely on entitlement programs,](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/dec/06/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-more-walmart-employees-medicaid-/) the Walton family is worth $102.7 billion, [**more wealth than 40% of the country, or approximately 125 million Americans combined**](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/jul/31/walmart-family-wealthier-40-percent-united-states/).

"I dont like Walmart. Wherever they have been built in small towns across America, they caused the elimination of numerous small businesses -- dress shops, five and dimes, hardware stores, soda fountains, etc. But Walmart is not to blame for a Welfare system on steroids. The number of people receiving government benefits is obscene and growing daily. Our government wants and encourages expansion of the Welfare system in every way possible. This is not a result of business decisions, it is a deliberate result of government."
"Then stop shopping there. Everyone I know seems to hate Walmart, but it stays open. Based on my little circle, I am the only one who shops there - but, I have them deliver things to my front door. I know people at Walmart who do make a lot of money. The work in Bentonville and either provide services for Walmart or work directly for them. Not all Walmart employees are working at a cash register - it is a big company. "
"I love it how walmart comes in to a town kills the local businesses and ruin other people jobs, then they got no where else go than walmart. "

"Dont give them all this money then, then Walmart will be forced to raise wages in order to get employees, now they dont need to since the government is providing some of the employee pay, changing the intersection point of the supply and demand curve, basic economics, something most congressmen or women know virtually nothing about."
"May I suggest to the house Dems that they should create their own super stores, pay high wages and maintain the lowest prices so the lower income people may purchase more. Im sure the house Dems are just great entrepreneurs. "
I wonder how much Walmart would cost taxpayers if they werent providing jobs to millions of Americans.
"Walmart isnt the problem, minimum wage is. And no I do not mean raising it, I mean getting rid of it. The welfare programs are what is keeping us down yet people are crying for more welfare? What? This country needs a lesson in economics."
Walmarts annual payroll is around 50 Billion a year. This means Walmart pays the government around 8 Billion in payroll taxes every year. 
I understand Wal-Mart being the face of corporate greed but they are not the cause alone. An even bigger problem working class Americans face is the constant use of temp agencies filling permanent positions minus the better pay and benefits that regular employees enjoy. Wal-Mart is not alone in complete rape and abuse of the lower classes. 
Ive worked for two Walmarts like ten or so years ago. They paid more than most other places and I had no issues.
"I love how the spokeswoman says ya but if you work in those low wage job, you can become a manager ... at which point somebody else is hired back into the taxpayer-subsidized entry level job. i.e.: Thats completely irrelevant. "
"Walmart is bad for the country on many levels, I make a determined effort to stay out of their stores."
UPS is HORRIBLE FOR DOING THE SAME THING they manage to stay out of the new for it somehow. Very low wages and CONSTANT HOUR CUTS leave employees with as little as 15 hours a week sometimes at 8.50 an hour when they are hired promising much more and ACTUALLY SUGGEST EMPLOYEES GET ON FOOD STAMPS to compensate PATHETIC
"How about making people with jobs ineligible for food stamps? Its counter-intuitive, and I guess thats what makes it hard to sell. We get arguments like why should we give money to people that dont work, but not people who do?. Right, because the employer is supposed to be picking up the tab for the working man. Youll also get Why should I work when I get free money for not working. Exactly, employers like wal-mart would have to raise their wages so as that working for a living actually represents a better standard of living than not working. The way its supposed to work."
"As Ive said before - and Im sure r/politics agrees - to increase wages, we need to import more immigrants and grant amnesty to existing undocumented workers so that other potential workers are not deterred from entering the country. As we all know, increasing the supply of workers increases demand and thereby increases wages."
"Not really. When my dad moved out, housing was cheaper, and so was fuel, but not much else was. They brought basics, because everything else was too expensive (bread, butter, shitty cuts of meat). And I talk about luxuries for a reason. In my dads day, a new Tv cost a fortune. He would need to save up for months to buy one. Likewise when PCs were becoming popular, it cost my dad months to save up for one. Another thing to consider. Now days, women earn more and work more. My mother would work at best a part time, low paying job (75c in the dollar was an achievement). Most the time she didnt work at all. Now days it isnt hard to have a dual income household. Even if you dont have a SO, you can easily live with a friend to cut rent and other costs. So I dont really think you are giving it as much thought as you should. When you first move out, you often have to give up stuff. The same stuff my Dad lived without most of his life. * Shit housing. My dads first house was a 2 bedroom shack. * Crappy food. My dad lived off of cheap meat cuts, bread and butter. Anything else was a luxury. A bottle of softdrink was a very rare treat. * A crap box car that broke down all the time. My dad had several of those babies. * A mostly empty house as far as furniture and household goods go. My dad was lucky to own a small tv once he was well established. So frankly if you can tell me you have roughed it in those ways, and you still cannot possibly afford move, I might start to believe you. Oh and did I mention my dad had his first kid (my oldest brother) when he was 19? "
"30 years ago, before I was born, my dad got a job that paid $15 per hour. It was good job back then. Today, I have a job that pays $15 per hour. He bought a house for some $30,000. Same house today is +$300,000. Same wage 30 years later, but a house is nearly 10x the cost."
"I think the real reason is the fact that we dont want to give up anything. I moved out of home, I had to give up a few luxuries. When my Dad moved out of home at 17, he gave up virtually nothing (because most people had little wealth in terms of material possessions), but he gained a ton of freedom. When someone of our generation (young adults) moves out of home, we have to seriously downgrade everything. So in a way we are kinda spoiled. And it isnt easy going from a middle class + household to a low income one. "
Politicians dont want deflation. They love inflation. They would rather see food destroyed or houses torn down than sold for less.
"I am curious what your Dad did and what you do. Are you in the same industry? Interestingly enough, my dad was lucky to bring home 10$ an hr 30 years ago. And that was as a qualified tradesperson (he got barely anything as an apprentice). Now he earns upwards of 40+ an hr. "
"When your dad moved out at age 17, the cost of living was vastly lower. These days, the average age of minimum wage workers is 35 and 88% of them are older than 20. http://www.epi.org/publication/wage-workers-older-88-percent-workers-benefit/ In Texas where I live, minimum wage does not cover average rent, utilities, transportation to work, food, and clothes/hygiene items from Walmart. According to basic math, there is nothing left for health insurance or a few luxuries. Furthermore, there are [3 applicants for every job opening](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/07/gene-sperling/there-are-3-unemployed-people-every-job-opening-ob/). So adults under the age of 35 are screwed instead of spoiled."
"And other things costed way more (like Tvs, Mobile Phones, Air-conditioners / Heaters, most plastics ect.). Basically the majority of luxuries we take for granted, or as non-luxuries. Do you think my dad had the benefit of Chinas cheap exports? do you think every home had 3 tvs? Even computers and the internet were an expensive luxury as late as the 90s. You will simply see it how you want to. But if you choose to live how my Dad lived, you can have money to put in the bank. If you choose to live how you have lived while at your parents house, you probably wont stand a chance. "
I call BS. I was in NYC in the 1970s. Minimum wage would pay for a decent apt. and enough to put money in the bank.
"This reminds me of the movie idiocracy when starbucks has changed into a full release massage parlor. Hey two hundred years ago rich white guys didnt want anything to change, 200 years later rich white guy dont want anything to change but the party name has changed. Bring back the Whigs!"
"Youll recall that in the era of slavery, the Northern Democrats and the Southern Democrats were effectively different parties, yes?"
"The events surrounding the passage of the Civil Rights acts of the 1960s, and the subsequent plan by the Republican party, which they called, [The Southern Strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) to flip the racist Democrats over to the Republican party, and then subsequently politically positioning the GOP as anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic helped to pretty well counter the positions the Democratic party took decades ago."
"I dunno, the Democrats have been able to shake being the party of [slavery](http://www.sonofthesouth.net/democratic-party-platform.htm) and the [KKK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#Overview:_Three_Klans). To wit: &gt;In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic party, the planter class, and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy. Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society. It aimed to reverse the interlocking changes sweeping over the South during Reconstruction: to destroy the Republican partys infrastructure, undermine the Reconstruction state, reestablish control of the black labor force, and restore racial subordination in every aspect of Southern life. This is literally objective, factual history. Yet theyve shaken that position pretty well, wouldnt you say? Why in the world would you think the GOP will not be able to shake having taken that position? "
"in effect? Mind telling me where you got that source, because Politifact has a [different take](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democratic-party-cre/). A historian quoted in the article sums it up nicely with The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today, she wrote to us. Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ?Dixiecrats? flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ?reform,? supporting a variety of ?liberal? causes, including civil rights, women?s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century. So yes, if the Republican party reversed their platform yet kept the same name perhaps in a couple of decades it will be forgotten. It wont stop people posting reference to the actions of the previous tenets the party espoused, like you have just done. "
"&gt; My favorite Politifact stories are the ones where their write up of a Democratic statement explains that its 100% true but then rates it half true or false. I caught one of those once; the claim was made that in x number of states, you could legally be fired for your sexual orientation. If you look up such laws by state, youll find this to be completely accurate. Politifact gave it a half true rating because a lot of corporations have anti-discrimination policies. Which has absolutely nothing to do with the original statement."

"Not only is Texas NOT the #1 recipient of federal aid, it is also one of the few red states to send more money to Washington than it receives. Your comment is all kinds of wrong."
"In theory you could receive the most money but also still show as net positive. A state might receive $10 but contribute $8; while Texas could receive $100 but contribute $150. Thus it could both, receive the most and still contribute in a positive amount. "
"Hey, TreesACrowd (great username BTW), So I did a wee bit of research and found out that, yes, you are right, TODAY Texas pays more to the feds that it gets.

&gt; First counter-example that comes to mind wrt a democrat being corrupt regarding financial ties was Solyndra. [You mean the company that applied for loan guarantees under George W.

"Quick question: If this was the GOPs idea, why didnt they push it through when they had control of the house, the senate and the presidency. Anyone?"
Another liberal rewrite of history. Soon the ignorant followers of this country will believe that Democrats were the party of Lincoln and fought to end slavery.
The individual mandate was an idea thought of by a conservative guy in a conservative think tank. Obamacare is not just an individual mandate. Its literally thousands of pages of regulation that does so much more than mandate health insurance. 
And Obama hated obamacare until he proposed it.
"Oh? This lie again? Here, let me walk us through how ridiculous this myth is. Decades ago, some Republicans proposed an individual mandate. Liberals, then, seem to argue that it means Republicans today should support literally all 1000 or so pages of the ACA. Right. Whatever. "
"It is a sign that the U.S. Government cant pay its own bills.

That is money that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, borrowed from China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers. And over the next 5 years, between now and 2011, the President?s budget will increase the debt by almost another $3.5 trillion. Senator Barrack Obama 2006 You mean people can change their opinions?! Who would have thought?"
Biased
Democrats hated Obamacare until Obama proposed it Funny how that works.
"And you r/politics posters loved Obamacare, until you discovered that building a policy around wishful thinking is not sound. And now you are trying to blame Republicans for it. "
Theyve always got an out. All they need to do is proclaim that theyve unfunded/repealed/exorcised Obamacare and replaced it with the true conservative plan: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
"Romneys healthcare plan was different in a matter of degrees. Funding and expenditures were different here and there, but generally the same ideas. Kills me that all my coworkers have to tell me how bad Obamacare is and Im like, So you just got better medical for less than you were paying, your children are now insured, granny with diabetes just got insurance where she was denied before, what the fuck is your dumb fucking problem you fucking pubtards."
did democrats love it too?
"Romneycare was done at the state level, not national. As many of you know, the GOP talks about States Rights a lot. This is a perfect example of something that can be supported at the state level, but not national. Theres no hypocrisy there, but its a laugh that after bashing the GOP for states rights talk so often, the left completely forgets the GOP is actually being consistent here. Further, the article doesnt really demonstrate much in the way of the results of this experiment in MA. Im sure there is plenty of debate, but its certainly not unequivocally wonderful. Massive cost overruns with healthcare becoming a rather large portion of the budget each year. Perhaps a failed experiment? And why would the GOP want to spread a failed idea all over the country? Is it logical that if you try an idea and it doesnt meet your goals, you should double down and spread that same concept everywhere? Or should you perhaps move on and try something different? Does it really make sense to say that since someone in the GOP had an idea in 1989, that that idea has to be followed forever, even after its been proven wrong in experimentation? Furthermore, if someone in the GOP comes up with a concept, does that mean every member of the GOP has to follow that idea forever, even if they didnt like it in the first place? Certainly not. Thankfully for the country, for instance, Democrats are no longer married to their former racist, Jim Crow ways. Nor do I hold them to the standard that they must have the same ideas forever, even after those ideas are proven bankrupt?"
"A few inconvenient facts: If they actually loved it, as OP suggests, they certainly would have passed it when they controlled the House, Senate and White House during the 107th, 108th and 109th Congresses. Theres a big difference between individual states implementing (testing) various policies and imposing those policies at a federal level. What works in California or Massachusetts isnt automatically going to work for the whole country. More importantly, this policy did NOT work in Massachusetts where it was implemented - health care costs were astronomical. Obamacare was a 2,500-page bill. Of course it contained some things that Republicans liked, but the devil can often be in the details. Two people can agree on a destination and disagree about how to get there. Perhaps most importantly, Obamacare was constructed in such a way that a significant portion of the law was effectively left blank. Various executive departments controlled by President Obama (HHS, IRS, Commerce etc) were instructed to create the actual policy in the form of regulations. Thats why a 2,500 page bill has resulted in 30,000+ pages of regulations. Republicans rightly feared that this blank check would empower the regulators to impose specific policies that were controversial (for example, mandating 100% coverage of birth control). Long story short, theres a reason that Obamacare became law without a single GOP vote. And its not solely politics. There were and continue to be legitimate policy concerns."
"This is just the most nonsensical argument that gets parroted. Who cares that some politicians advocated this in the past. It wasnt pased before and it shouldnt have been passed now. Also if you actually care Mitt Romney just tore apart how obamacare IS NOT romneycare. I dont support either, and many CURRENT politicians and citizens do not also. I support the changes to health insurance the CURRENT republicans in the House have called for."
and Obama was an opponent of gay marriage. People change. Maybe the GOP realized that Obamacare was a bad idea. thankfully someone has looked at the facts and realized the truth.
This is BULLSHIT... At NO time did the GOP ever put forth a concerted effort to move ANYTHING like HillaryCare or Obamacare...!!!
The biggest problem with Obamacare for them is the Obama part.
"Democrats good but to central, republicans are psycho racist rich retards. Everything Obama does is good bush sucked, republicans are bad and foxnews LOL AMIRITE??. Im smart if you disagree you suck. I dont use facts I use opinion pieces cause thats where corporations cant influence what people write. LOLOL REPUBLICANS R STOOPID!!! 8===D~~~~ "
Obviously. Republicans and Democrats answer to the same puppet masters. Their conflict is only a charade meant to confuse and get people invested. None of it is real. 
"It seems like republicans have in the past intentionally restricted access to health care for certain demographics. Now that these demographics will be able to get health care, the republicans are pissed off about it."
"Everything the government does is to be fully involved in every facet of our lives. Do not trust the government, it has been corrupt and taken too much power."
"So lets give the conservatives the delay they want. I cant help but wonder how would things have gone had rational adults spent some time debating pros and cons and worked to resolve glaring issues. What we have had instead is BS fear mongering and the ridiculous mindless obstruction politics. I do remember one specific request from the conservative side as a condition to end the shutdown: they wanted to extend the deadline for the uninsured and underinsured. They wanted them to have more time to select and begin paying for a plan before the penalties kick in. Now a million or more underinsured have just learned that their plan will be cancelled and they must enroll in another plan on the exchange. Well considering what we went through over this past two months with the government shutdown, and Obamacare obstruction, and negotiations over whether to raise the debt ceiling its time for hardball negotiation. Obama should go ahead and give the conservatives what they wanted, extend all the deadlines by one year. And in exchange, taxes should be raised on the wealthy to cover the losses for that year. What difference will one year really matter to the long term viability of the Affordable Care Act? Will it fail to hit a certain mark by 10 years? So what...we wait eleven years. Meanwhile 25 million people have one more year to figure out what in the hell is going on with this insurance thingy. I mean seriously, were talking about the redneck, hillbilly, gangsta, vato set. Do we really expect all 25 million to process through the insurance industry over the next 2 to 6 months? Give these guys a break. Give the people who run the exchanges an extra year to work through the issues as well. All the chaos leading up to this rollout was more than enough to demoralize and confuse those responsible for implementation of the law. Give them a break. Give the conservatives what they want, extend the deadlines in exchange for something the liberals want. Sounds like a fair deal to me. "
Obama should propose being irrational and hypocritical so theyll stop.
http://www.kansascity.com/2013/10/29/4585052/gop-loved-obamacare-until-obama.html GOP loved Obamacare until Obama proposed it 
"Except for the fact that Republicans wont propose a law that is extremely expensive. Just because Obama proposed the idea doesnt mean they hate it now, they dont like the idea of spending tons of money to fund it."
"Serious question. If this is what republicans wanted, why werent they able to get it implemented?"
Obamacare is literally one of the worst things to ever happen to America. Im sorry Reddit. Absurd Medical costs are the problem! This will not solve the real problem at all and will just further burden the middle class. On top of the lies? Like are we serious? The republicans and democrats are the same BY THE WAY. Im fucking tired of the teams. 
"Well, they loved part of it. A lot of the regulation and fines/taxes on businesses were not part of the Heritage plan. Neither was the public option which was originally in the PPACA. A lot of Republicans have been trying not to repeal the whole thing, but to trim it back down to what the Heritage plan was, with guaranteed increased demand for health insurance providers and absolutely no new healthcare regulation or responsibility for businesses. Theyve already succeeded in getting the public option removed and employer mandates delayed. "
"You read too much garbage. [You need to learn something about the people who oppose healthcare for Americans.](http://jonathanturley.org/2013/10/12/ted-cruz-dominionism-and-jesus/) Healthcare that every citizen in every other industrialized country in the entire world already has, at far lower cost than we all pay."
"Obamacare is going to fail so hard. It does not matter who supported it and when, its a [train wreck in slow motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9r93OxpE8g). "
Democrats hated GOPcare until Obama proposed it.
"&gt;Champions of the Republican Idea Theory tend to respond to the presentation of these facts by charging that that the concept of an individual mandate was the product of a 1989 paper issued by the conservative Heritage Foundation (something its author vigorously denies), and that Republicans were so taken by the idea of forcing everybody to buy a private product that . . . well, actually herein lies the problem. Truth be told, Republicans were so taken with Heritage?s design that a grand number of two of them ever went so far as to introduce a federal bill based on it and Mitt Romney used it as the basis of reform in deep-blue Massachusetts. Oh, and Newt Gingrich once said something nice about it ? in 1995. This, suffice it to say, is hardly a ringing endorsement. m.nationalreview.com/article/362426/single-payer-fantasy-charles-c-w-cooke"
Well it was their idea in the first place.
"When Obama (and Clinton) was stumping for this healthcare system, the Republicans picked the wrong tactic. If I had been the strategist I think I would have made the position: We applaud the president for finally instituting the healthcare system weve been calling for for decades. We are pleased that the democrats have finally seen the light. That would leave them open to make it a non-issue in the campaign, to fight on other wedge issues, suck credit for it away from the democrats AND attack it later on minor points of implementation whenever anything looked bad (like the website). "
"The obvious cognitive dissonance is hilarious, but its not from the left. Well see how badly it fails or succeeds after its implemented. "

"Thats what Democrats do not get. It is not about Democrats vs Republicans. If I was alive, I would have hated it just as much under Nixon or any other Republican. It cannot work. That is not how insurance works. The ACA is an unsustainable system. When it doesnt work, Democrats will say, see the free market just cannot solve our health insurance problem and will then either socialize healthcare or move to a single payer system. When in reality, our fucked up healthcare system wreaks of governments grubby sausage fingers. Our healthcare system (even prior to ACA) was not a free market system."
&gt;until a black man proposed it FTFY
I understand why they would like it initially as it was a lobbyist driven piece of garbage intended to force people to pay for a service they may not want at that time. or Maybe after it got voted in other people actually read the law and were very unhappy with anyone that supported the terrible law and so the GOP in order to satisfy its voters decided to try to fight it...?? IDK just guesses?
"Actually, PBS ran a special about Romney and Obama and the GOP didnt like it when Romney suggested basically the same idea for Massachusetts. The GOP hates anything that changes the status quo. Thats the point, to keep the rich, rich. "
Just like van jones was talking about in bigthink. Cant please these Cuntservatives.
Obama should announce a policy that GOP members will not be allowed to shoot themselves in the head.
Its funny that Obamacare is really Romneycare with Republic-forced cuts
"The GOP has completely abandoned its base. You cant have a whole party whose mission is to undermine the other. Why is global warming not endorsed by Republicans? Because Democrats and Al Gore jumped on it, and the GOP has to be the opposition party on every issue. Instead of moving toward the great Republican Party of the past, America is moving towards the Tea Party. GOP ideals of low spending and national defense are irrelevant. Theyve become too reckless."
"Its unclear to me why Republicans *dont* love Obamacare. * It mandates that far more people buy products from huge corporations, creating the potential for tremendous profit. * It redistributes wealth from the proportionally healthier, younger millenials and Gen-Xers (who normally might not buy insurance or might buy bare-bones, but will now be mandated to purchase plans with coverage they dont need nor want) to the boomers. The boomers failed to plan for retirement, so theyre not vacating the jobs that pay well, they ran the economy into the ground so if they *do* vacate those jobs the jobs are just being phased out or replaced by part-time positions, and otherwise generally kicked the ladder down behind them. The only way they can possibly screw us over more is to force us to pay for their healthcare, the cost of which will continue to balloon as they age and their clogged arteries catch up with them. * It creates a great excuse for businesses to turn full-time jobs into part-time jobs, which means less labor cost, and *still* not have to pay for benefits. Many of them went through their 20s, 30s, and 40s blowing their health insurance money on cocaine and big screen TVs. Now theyve got pre-existing conditions, and they need someone to foot the bill for their healthcare. What better way to do it than make those entitled youngsters finally pull some of their own weight around here? In short: Businesses getting richer. Check. Boomers getting richer / avoiding responsibility. Check. Seems like a Republican dream to me."
"I for one, against the beliefs of many in my circles, cannot wait until they raise the minimum wage even more. Soon it will be cheaper to have robots cook burgers in an assembly line than to have a sub par human that deserves more money than his labor is worth to cook it."
" When the minimum wage is lifted, the burden on tax payers is also lifted. They qualify for less food stamps and welfare. They get less supplemental help in the ACA. They pay more in taxes and buy more, increasing demand. It has a multiplier effect."
Sooooo you shouldnt work for minimum wage then duh
Poverty is slavery.
True. Whos pushing the idiocy of abstinence only sex education and trying to deny access to contraceptives? While taking funds from womens healthcare programs to finance the religious rights fake crisis pregnancy centers and adoption mills. And slashing food stamps.

No minimum wage will ever lift most out of poverty.
One of the reasons why Im in favor of a [Universal Basic Income.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/)
The difference between the minimum wage and the living wage. 
"minimum wage jobs arent meant to support a family. they are meant for young people, and at the very worst, single people. the days of single income households are gone. when you look at that chart, it looks a hell of a lot better than the agenda that someone is trying to push. it shows that a single person with a minimum wage job is roughly 20% above the poverty level, and 2 minimum wage earners are way beyond the poverty level for 2 adults 1 kid (and likely 2 adults 2 kids, which isnt shown in the graph) these poverty levels are also likely the new obama administration standards (which went into effect somewhere around 2010), which raised the bar for what poverty was to include more people."
"To tell you how darn old I am, I paid for college with a minimum wage job! It meant living at home and going to local University , but it was my only way. Try that today, Boehner."
"Notice what they do not mention 1. Less than 2% of the population earn minimum wage. 2. The reason the democrats push for an increase in the minimum wage is some union contracts are tied to the MW. ie: The MW goes up $1 their wage goes up too (of course much more). 3. Every on think Walmart and MickieDs, buy more mom and pop enterprises will be effected. Point of fact few Walmart and McD employees make minimum wage. 4.Where will the money come from? Easy the prices of things will go up, it is called inflation. 5. People that will be hurt most? The people who currently make $2 or 3 above MW their wages will not go up but their buying power will be decreased due to prices going up. Now go ahead and down vote me if you must does not make my points wrong. Ask yourself where you stand in the wage scale, at minimum wage? If not you WILL loose buying power. And as the Congressional budget office says we will loose another 500,000 jobs will one be yours? Also as an adult if you have been working for more than a year and are still making MW most likely the problem is you not the MW."
*Is* the minimum wage designed to lift people out of poverty?
"Poverty is an incredibly hard socioeconomic state to rise out of. I hate when I hear people claim that If you work hard enough, you can get yourself out of it! Its not just about hard work. In order to progress you also need opportunities to present themselves. Just because you work 60 hours at McDonalds doesnt mean your going to rise out poverty. You need to be exposed to different people, making new connections and thus providing various employment opportunities. But meeting new people proves to be difficult when you devote all your energy to a job paying minimum wage just to skim-by financially. A sense of ambition also needs to exist. You need to know that you can achieve in other fields of the workforce. Unfortunately, people that grow up in poverty typically go to poorly funded schools, where their self esteem can take a beating due to various factors like a weak teaching staff, low grades, and unproductive peers that instill a similar mind set of mediocrity. From there it can become a cycle within the family, teaching the same hard facts of life to their children. In short, hard work is not enough to rise out of poverty. You need opportunities to present themselves and need the ambition and self-confidence to take them. TL;DR: Hard work, opportunity, and self-confidence are all required to progress. "
"Minimum wage needs to go up, but people need to stop deluding themselves with the idea that they can conceive 4 children and raise them successfully while living in squalor."
"A couple of clarifications from those more expert on this topic. Does poverty level include any public benefits like housing assistance, snap, etc? If so that would seem to muddy up the data. Also do we know if the poverty level has risen more or less than general CPI inflation? Thanks."
"Personally, I think that minimum wage laws have to be balanced with a high corporate and personal tax rate for people making more than a certain amount of money. If the amount of profit isnt capped, then all the costs can be effectively passed onto the consumer, whereas if they are capped, there is a tax incentive to reinvesting in employees and capital investments."
No Shit! source: everybody
"There are 11 million people unemployed in the US who want to work. There are 3+ people who want jobs for every job every month. &gt;A new Wal-Mart store in Washington D.C. has been inundated with applications for associates. The store is currently combing through more than 23,000 applications for 600 available positions, reports NBC Washington. That means that Wal-Mart will be able to hire one person for every 38 applications it receives ? i.e., just 2.6% of applicants will walk out with a job. "
The minimum wage is a poor alternative to a system which pays people equally for the work they do no matter what that work is. There should be a rate of hourly pay which it costs to hire a persons to labor in whatever job you have for them. The system of paying people based on what you can leverage their labor for leads to unbalance.
"Thats because minimum wage policy alone *cannot* lift people from poverty. If increasing wage floors were tied to increases in wealth, then why not just make it $20 an hour? $50 an hour? $100 an hour? The higher you go, the more obvious it becomes- this is not a sound principle. You cant just create wealth by applying a wage floor."
"Minimum wage was designed so people could earn a living rather than working for slave wages. Todays minimum wages, adjusted for inflation, ARE LESS THAN SLAVE WAGES. "
"Hard work will lift you out of poverty. Maybe those people deserve the bare minimum. Im a working college student who worked my way up to a couple bucks above minimum and if the minimum wage goes up Im back to the same wage as coworkers who frankly, dont deserve it. It will kill chances to get raises and will hurt the people it aims to help. "
"That is not the function of minimum wage. Minimum wage is to protect unskilled workers who are new to the workforce from being taken advantage of while they are accumulating the skills they need to advance. Im sorry, but unskilled entry level service jobs are not what you should be trying to make it to the middle class on. You want to make it to the middle class? You do something physically demanding, dangerous, or technical, things others cant or wont do. "
It was never suppose to be
"Minimum wage is not about lifting people out of poverty or providing anyone with enough money to support themselves or a family. There are lots of jobs out there that just cant and should not pay over a given amount. They just cant yield anything at that given cost. If you create or raise minimum wage the only way around this, if you hold current productions, it to raise prices...and in most cases, the prices that get raised are those that relate to the people getting minimum wage. Additionally, raising minimum wage means more people pay more tax. What we need is a system that allows people to build skills and build a career that pays more than a minimum wage job, and system where jobs are strong. "
Whoever said the point of minimum wage was to lift people out of poverty?
And it isnt intended to. Full stop.
"It is if you are single. For goodness sake, if you cant afford a family, dont have one."
I feel like this could also be due to bad habits. A decent wage doesnt mean anything if youre still giving monthly payments to Aarons so you can rent a PS3. 
Thats because minimum wage has fallen behind a living wage for decades.
ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO ITS AN ENTRY LEVEL JOB WHAT ADULT LACKS THE SKILLS AND WILLPOWER TO FIND BETTER WORK? goodness
"Youre fortunate, there are ~ 11 million people who would love to have jobs. I dont remember how many applicants there were for a new Walmart in DC, but it was huge. [There are more than three people who want to work for every job.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/unemployed-job-opening_n_3568646.html) I worked my way through school with little help from anyone, and the only loans were for each semester. That is much more difficult now, and I had a full time job and worked one or two part time jobs for years. "
But it sure as hell relieves the tax burden off the middle class. 
"So lets look at the numbers they provide: Single, no kids - Youre above the poverty line by 25%. Single, 1 kid - Youre $1000 shy of the poverty line, but get a $3300 refundable EITC, so youre 15% above the poverty line. Single, 2 kids - Youre $3700 below the poverty line, but get a $5400 refundable EITC, so youre 10% above the poverty line. Married, 1 kid - Youre $3700 below the poverty line, but that assumes only 1 parent is working. With the refundable EITC, you would be right at the poverty line, but then add in the other parent working even 20 hrs per week and you are 20% above the poverty line. Married, 2 kids - With the EITC, you are $3600 below the poverty line. So if the other parent works 8 hrs per week, you hit the poverty line. Im completely ignoring any other social programs in this. Just straight up pay and EITC, which everyone working (with kids) gets if they dont make too much money. Im not saying they are well off or fine. If we think the poverty line is too low, that is another discussion. But these people can live above the poverty line at the current minimum wage."
"One problem with a wage floor is that owners/management/investors (exploiters) can continue to raise prices for their goods and services and stuff all the additional profits into their own pockets rather than paying their staff better. Thus the cost of living rises but the wage floor rarely if ever improves. Probably a better solution than a wage floor, at least in theory, is a top-to-bottom pay ratio like the Swiss 1:12 Initiative."
The fix: Universal living wage disbursed income just for being alive. Universal single payer healthcare. no income tax for individuals. Flat fair tax at 7% on all services and new goods. [Spaceships](http://www.buildtheenterprise.com/) instead of weapons of war. Sustainable renewable energy that doesnt destroy our environment. Usury illegal on the level of murder1. post-scarcity resource based economy instead of inflated fiat. Trains. Be the person Mr. Rogers always knew you could be.
"I left home two weeks after I graduated from high school, and worked a full time job and one, sometimes two, part time jobs, going to night school. Different era, but its part of the reason why I have no patience with right wing idiots who have no concept of how badly theyre being screwed, or those who were smart enough to choose wealthy parents, and have no appreciation for the society that made that wealth possible."
Or Bill Nye.
"[This Paul? Dated article, its quite clear what both Pauls are.](http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2007/10/18/is-ron-paul-a-dominionist/) That might explain your opinion.

[Not true.](http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/minimum_wage)
Minimum wage is not supposed to lift anyone out of poverty.
"What will raising the minimum wage accomplish for most people? Most jobs arent minimum wage. People still struggle. Minimum wage jobs are usually (I stress usually) filled by the young, the inexperienced, or the under achieving. Honestly, this is just another entitlement generation issue. Im special. Im perfect. I deserve more. I was happy to have a minimum wage job in high school. I was happy to have those entry level positions that educated and prepared me. I worked my way up the ladder. Im sorry, but I dont think pushing a button and waiting for ding, fries are done is worth $10.10 an hour. Considering in some areas EMTs and first responders barely make more that $10 an hour its insulting. Furthermore, because they make slightly more than the proposed minimum wage, they will not see a raise. No, our problem isnt minimum wage. Its lifestyle and lack of willingness to earn a better life. If one cant survive on a minimum wage job, maybe one should get an additional part time job. "
"Why does this need to be stated every single day? We get it, minimum wage sucks."
Yay Im above poverty!
"Minimum wage was never intended to loft people out of poverty. If you raise the price of milk or gas you are going to decrease the sales of that item. Why people think raising the minimum wage will create jobs is beyond me. It will just decrease the amount of minimum wage jobs, e.g. transfer of wealth from some minimum wage earners to others. "
Everybody in this thread is fucking retarded.
"The War on Poverty came about shortly before the U.S. liberalized its immigration policy. While I in no way wish to go back to the days where we restricted immigration everywhere in the world except Western Europe we have to acknowledge that a lot of the countrys new poor comes from recent immigrant backgrounds. These people dont typically stay in poverty for generations but we have a constant and growing stream of lower income immigrants which means that many of these individuals and families will live in poverty for some time as they establish their roots in a new country. While this isnt the case for all families entrenched in poverty, education/employment opportunities are obviously the biggest factor for those, the rise in immigration coupled with a more competitive job market with the moving of blue collar jobs out of the country through agreements like NAFTA certainly hurt the most vulnerable families in America significantly. This is all ignoring the fact that public assistance benefits have been reduced steadily for decades now."
"Immigration has declined, but that never was the problem. The problem is the cycle of poverty from one generation to another, and another... Thats what has to be fixed. Globalization is a fact, it has very little to do with trade agreements. International corporations have adapted very well, some governments have not. Thats why we can buy smartphones, computers, tablets, clothes. A pair of jeans made in Vietnam is $35. A pair made in the US is $150. NAFTA and the TPP are efforts to cope with globalization instead of keeping economic problems from failure to deal with it. "
"Its time for Obama to keep his promises about change. He needs to sign an executive order raising the minimum wage to 10.10 over 3 years. Fuck congress, its time to grow a pair and start making shit happen. The fact he hasnt done something so obviously needed yet is making me regret getting in line to vote for him. Id still rather him than make rich people richer R. Money though, so I didnt have much of a choice."
"Everyone who works should just get a direct poverty tax, like 15% of your net earnings (after taxes). All the money collected would also go directly into the mailboxes of people who dont work. Problem solved."
"the minimum wage, nor **any other wage** has ever lifted anybody out of poverty wages reflect a workers contribution to the employer for which he is paid reasons the [minimum wage does not help](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-08-30/guest-post-minimum-wage-myth-won%E2%80%99t-die) the economy or any individual lifting"
Thats why it isnt called The lift most out of poverty wage.
And still wont... not at $10 an hour.

If you believe that a minimum wage job is a career then you deserve what you get. 
"Thanks to a Republican caused economic collapse, recession, and blocking all efforts to create jobs, there are still 11 million people who want to work, but there are no jobs. Every month, there are three people available for every open job. 23,000 people applied for 600 jobs at a new Walmart in DC. Thats reality. Some more stupid right wing nuts and libertarians claim those people are paid enough, they collect food stamps and Earned Income Tax Credits. Duh. We pay $billions for those food stamps, unemployment benefits and EITCs, getting shafted again by the Walton family and others. "
"The title implies that, previously, minimum wage has lifted people out of poverty, but it has stopped doing so. Where is the evidence to back this up? I see no correlation between minimum wage and other numbers: http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/rants/minwage2007/graph.png http://media.cleveland.com/datacentral/photo/11557873-large.jpg http://danieljmitchell.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/failed-war-on-poverty.jpg It seems that minimum wage, at least at levels we have seen, is ineffective at changing poverty or income of the poor. In fact, it may have even helped to stop the decline in poverty."
"The GOP PROMISED a replacement for the PPACA 1,341 days ago. Guess that one doesnt count......"
There are quite a few things he does have power over that he promised to change but hasnt.
This is why I get pissed when people say obama is a bad president because he didnt keep his promises. Its hard to keep your promises when you cant do anything.
"There are promises that he hasnt kept which require no consent from Congress or any other individual at all. [For example, theres simply no excuse for this. None!](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/234/allow-five-days-of-public-comment-before-signing-b/)"
But Obama didnt close Gitmo! rabble rabble rabble!
They should merge the executive and the legislature it would actually mean the president does what you voted them in for. 
"it depends which promises you look at. Sometimes you have to give the benefit of the doubt, like in these cases, but he didnt really run on placing appellate court nominees. HE did run on bipartisanship, and then immediately told the other side to go get bent ( actual quote was we won, we dont have to compromise ) . He also ran as a disruptor to the status quo, and first thing he did was open the coffers to his buddies for payback and assurance that it was all campaign rhetoric. Oh, and transparency . You cant really judge a president as bad while he is still in office, but you can judge as dishonest on some big issues, all of which were to attract the moderate vote. "
What if I told you having a party of extremists that will shut down the government and destabilize the economy to get their way is beyond something that being a strong leader can overcome? You call him a bad president for not keeping his promises when the opposition is literally willing to take the country hostage to stop it?
Oh for fucks sake. There is *plenty* of shit that he is well within his power to accomplish or at least meaningly push forward that the man completely fucking lied about. Whistleblower protection anyone? Are you saying the republicans prevented him from allowing Snowden to be protected? Obama is just another aristocrat politician protecting the hegemony. 
Why are you hitting yourself? Stop hitting yourself!
"What if I told you that the presidents job isnt to unilaterally enact his will, but to serve as a leader that unites congress behind a common cause? Only when we elect a king will the nation be changed by one person acting alone."
"If you like your plan, you can keep it. Period. His bill. Passed into law. Broken promise."
"&gt; when you cant do anything. Yes Obama has been completely ineffective at stopping his own executive branch from killing Americans without a trial, continuing the practice of indefinite detention, continuing National Security Letters, spying on every human on earth, maintaining undeclared drone wars in several countries, cementing the Patriot Act into place, raiding medical marijuana facilities, and a host of other dirty deeds. Obama even put bans on contraception for teenagers once -- before the 12 election. Surprisingly every Democrat was too busy cheering and campaigning on the concept of womens reproductive health to notice that Obama last major decision on the issue was to undercut it. I guess Republicans did it all too, or maybe they even started it. Heck, the govt has done these sorts of things forever, no reason to be alarmed now. And to his credit Obama tried to fix things, at least he thought about trying, but Republicans just wouldnt let him. Some Republicans even wanted to trick Obama into making changes so they could could call him soft on the status quo. In conclusion, I never liked the filibuster anyway and Democratic Party Presidential Candidate 2016."
"yeah, plus that damn george bush is still running the show and ruining everything!"

"The CBO is simply showing that the federal government is spending $X and then taxing $Y.

I literally oppose Obamacare for this reason and so do many people around here. The mandate without an accompanied restructuring to make insurance non-profit by law is nothing more than corporate welfare. &gt;Isnt that *literally* what he was insisting upon with his opposition to Ryans budget?

He didnt even need to - Ryans budget was a nonstarter and a political stunt, but he took the opportunity to clarify his position as being *even further to the right* of his party. i think you read my comment wrong. Consider for a moment we have massive spending on social programs for the poor but even larger handouts for the rich and well connected. Paul Ryan wants to protect the rich, and if anything give them more. Amash wants cuts across the board.

"&gt;Funny that they would go public before they can back any of this up, dont you think? Unless of course, they know its BS. It is not uncommon to report preliminary findings and summary progress in order to justify or make the case for being allowed more resources or to build publicity. Investigations arent usually completely funded and organized upfront. I mean, does the fact that leaks and preliminary findings (such as dropping big values for damage caused by climate change, etc.) have come from the IPCC mean they know its BS? Out of curiosity, if some prosecutions come out of this investigation, will you support voter ID laws? I think that most of the cases are unintentional, so they are not prosecuted. Of those that are intentional, I would think it very hard to find a case to prosecute unless they bragged about it in writing online or something. Except for teetotalers, virtually everyone will have needed to show their ID for *something* in their life?perhaps as small as an alcoholic drink. Why not for voting? "

You are a woman who got married and last name of your voter registration does not match your id. So sorry, you are no longer a mans equal under the law. Ah yes, my favorite, young people. You may have to drive several states away or endure a complicated absentee ballot process or your parents will be fined by our fine state government.

Flat tax would be disaster for the vast majority of people.
62% of Americans are functioning retards then. 
Which just goes to show how important the specific wording of polls is.
"If you want to stop collusion between big business and big government this is how you do it. That said, the only realistic version of a flat tax would still have to be progressive (0% up to $25K, 5% up to $50K, etc.). This entire movement should re-brand as the Simple Tax or the Graduated Tax or the Anti-Influence Tax or whatever. IMHO "

"A classic quote from one of Dave Barrys columns: Question: I understand that Congress is considering a so-called flat tax system. How would this work? Answer: If Congress were to pass a flat tax, youd simply pay a fixed percentage of your income, and you wouldnt have to fill out any complicated forms, and there would be no loopholes for politically connected groups, and normal people would actually understand the tax laws, and giant talking broccoli stalks would come around and mow your lawn for free, because Congress is NOT going to pass a flat tax, you pathetic fool.

As that link goes into though, there are multiple ways to define poorest. As the original comment was based around federal government assistance, I would say thats not too bad of a definition to work with, for this specific topic."
Thats explained in the first 40 seconds of the video. By are Republican he means That state went Republican in the last Presidential election.
Its a bad metric. People dont necessarily have the same ideas about national government than they have local. Looking at city councils/mayors/county commissioners is the best way to determine what localities favor which party.
&gt; 9 of 10 Poorest States Are Republican Explain this. Every person in these states is a Republican? Every leader is a Republican? Every legislator is a Republican? Most people are Republicans? Most leaders are Republicans? Most legislators are Republicans? And if its the latter (lattest?) wheres the evidence that THAT is the reason for poverty?
We must invent the sarcasm mark! And soon!
"If you look at the data, it seems that it was neither. The stock market crash hurt, but unemployment rose to 9% for a mere one month and then came back down to 6.3% (!) which is where it was in 1930 when the first federal intervention took place."
"Right. And it wasnt the massive government spending on public works that got us out of the depression, it was the massive government spending on WW2."
That doesnt change anything I said about the selfishness of FDR or the democrats. http://www.reddit.com/r/all/?count=125&amp;after=t3_1w042i
"&gt;it was the massive government spending on WW2. Only if the sole defenition of the great depression was unemployment. Sure, during the war unemployment was reduced to ~3%. But what good are those jobs if they involve getting shot at overseas, or the salary you make at home doesnt buy anything because everything was rationed, including food. Nobody bought cars, nobody bought houses in the suburbs...WWII was a miserable time to live through, just as bad as the decade earlier, if not worse. Only *after* the war in the late 40s &amp; 50s did people start to enjoy the American dream. By the way, did you know that [President Truman cut federal spending](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/04/biggest-budget-cut-in-u-s-history/) by over 40% immediately after WWII? We cant even cut the *rate of growth* of spending by 5% in this country without Obama screaming bloody murder. "
"6.3%? Funny, almost every book Ive ever read put it at 25%. You might want to look up the bonus Army as well."
&gt; it was the massive government spending on WW2. War is always inflationary and it is stimulative the way a [broken window](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window) is stimulative . You can make a more convincing argument that the utter destruction of our industrial competitors got us out of the Great Depression. 
... not sure if serious? Ive heard people say the same thing without any sense of irony. Massive government spending domestically on things that actually have material benefit for US citizens: COMMUNISM! The government cant create jobs! Massive government spending abroad on things that have no material benefit for US citizens: SALVATION! Weve been saved by government spending!
Because everyone of those things happened in Mass. after Rmoney forced it down the peoples throats at gun point.

"I think the precedent is way, way narrower than the headline would imply. The case in question involved a suspect under arrest whose duly confiscated cell phone rang and the police answered which led to his home and more evidence. Thats well short of actively digging for information in a phone and doesnt apply to just anyone, but only people already under arrest."
Can we PLEASE impeach this piece of shit yet?
The fact that the Obama administration asked for this is disgusting. Asking to ignore the 4th. Shame on you Obama.
Assuming SCOTUS agrees with the administration an rules that cell phone searches are not a violation of the 4th amendment what happens in the case of a pass coded phone? Would a locked phone bring 4th amendment rules back into play sort of like a locked case in the trunk of a car?
Why ask the the supreme court? The secret FISA court has never rejected a request. 
"Ahhh HELL NO! What part of [this](http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/) is unclear? **The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.**"

"I wish redditors would stop posting such misleading titles. This deals around easier access to phones belonging to individuals that have been arrested, not just any citizens phone they feel like checking. "
Chalk up another issue I disagree with the president over. 
"So lets put this into context. The cops in this case used the guys cell phone which was receiving calls from a number tagged my house to ID the guys house, and go there. They found a bunch of drug stuff there. Had they simply used his drivers license (which includes his address) that search would have been legitimate. This guy is arguing that because they flipped open his phone, it was an unconstitutional search. The question is whether we can say that simply flipping open a cell phone is different from doing a search of the persons wallet. I cant see that differentiation. I really hope this case gets cert denied, because its a terrible case. Lets wait for a decent test case where the cops actually accessed non-local data using someones cell phone (and I dont mean call logs, I mean like their server at home or something). Otherwise, this is going to turn out badly for privacy."
Fuck obama. Can I say this? I fucking did.
"Im not from USA, I have no affiliation to any political party, where Im from (Argentina) the lady president is crazy, where I live (Spain) corruption runs rampant. That being said, I have a question, is it really Obama asking all these things? I believe that no president will ever have the power to fix anything or to actually run anything, it feels like we are ruled by economic power (read banks, big corporations) and when some hero savior gets elected, it doesnt matter how nice he/she is the moment he/she sits in the big chair, will have to deal with bigger power and forces when the time for making decisions hits in. - Say, I promised to lower taxes for low income people, lets do it - Uh Mr President, cant do that, if we do so, well have these kind of mad, and if they are mad theyll crash the market, oh and the unions, theyll want a cut of the profits thus getting companies against it too - sigh... ok, lets get our people out of that country we invaded, its time to end the war - uh, sir, we cant do that. Military wont be happy, they have a budget to fulfill, also we have some contractors working there too, theyll be out of jobs... - can I **actually do anything that I promised???** You get the idea. When Spanish now president was campaigning he promised not to raise taxes, after a couple of months in the job, he raised the taxes, he tried not to but then Merkel and even USA government told him dude, you **want** to raise taxes. Now hes happily telling everybody how Merkel and USA are happy with higher taxes because, well, its better. However due to higher taxes small business is going bankrupt. From outside it seemed to me that Obama was the man for the change but then I read about people who caused the economic collapse still having important jobs and still making decisions and thought poor Obama, he wont be able to do shit and hell get the blame. I know I might be wrong and he just lied his way to power and now hes enjoying it, but I kind of believe that the guy had his best intention to fulfill everything he promised but then he found the hard way he cant actually do shit.

I regret voting for Obama now. Not that anyone else would have been different. Im done voting and caring. Theyre all crooks.
"Although the headline omits it, this case is about searching someone during a lawful arrest. Police have always been allowed to search incident-to-arrest without a warrant. [For example](https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/414/414.US.218.72-936.html): &gt; It is well settled that a search incident to a lawful arrest is a traditional exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. This general exception has historically been formulated into two distinct propositions. The first is that a search may be made of the person of the arrestee by virtue of the lawful arrest. The second is that a search may be made of the area within the control of the arrestee."

"ITT: a bunch of commenters who didnt read the article. Question: if the police spot me selling crack and arrest me, do they have the right to search my wallet without a warrant?

"On the other hand, the Massachusetts case involves a primitive flip-phone, which could make this a bad test case. I suspect that is the reason the government chose this one and they will try to apply the precedent to any phone in police custody."

"For rooted Android users theres a good way to prevent the cops from snooping into your privacy, should they get your phone for some reason. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsdroid.cerberus Its a paid service however its only a few bucks for a life time license. It lets you do all kinds of things to screw over anyone who steals your phone such as take pictures with the front or back camera, take screencaps, send you an email of their text messages and phone call logs, and it can also wipe your phones internal memory which is what would be useful here. It can remotely reboot your phone into recovery mode where it then wipes your phones data partition. In other words, when your phone comes back on its like it was when you first turned it on. So even if the cops do search your phone, theyre not going to find a thing. It can also wipe your SD cards. I would suggest doing that first since it also deletes itself when it does the data partition wipe."
This kind of shit is gonna get a republican elected president again
"1. Obama really has no say in these matters. Hes taking his orders from higher-ups. 2. This is a moot issue anyway, as the NSA is feeding peoples personal information to the DEA, FBI, CIA, and local law enforcement anyway."
"People realize that Obama doesnt make decisions whether or not to appeal these cases, right? These decisions are up to the prosecutors or the DOJ and it would be highly inappropriate for the executive branch to interfere with individual cases."
"Because the supreme court rules on favors, not the constitution, right?"
Obama administration asks Supreme Court to allow violation of Fourth Amendment rights.
Whats next? Cameras in every home? Military patrols in the streets? Suspension of free elections? Nothing would surprise me at this point.
My least favorite thing about reading this kind of stuff is knowing the next election will be nothing but Im not Obama from both sides. But it will be the same people doing the same things. Im not even mad anymore. I just wish theyd put out some new episodes instead of endless re-runs.

Certainly not the kind of *change* one would have expected...
"The real question is where the hell did they dig up a picture of a 12 year old Motorola v60, and how the hell someone thought people would actually recognize that as a phone anymore..."
Whats next? Warrant-less house and car searches?
Can you feel the boot on your neck yet? 
"This is actually a little misleading. Its already been Constitutionally approved by the courts, for years, for police to search an individual in conjunction with an arrest. So while its technically warrantless, the search inherently has probable cause based upon the arrest."
"&gt; the government argues that the First Circuit?s ruling conflicts with the rulings of several other appeals courts, as well as with earlier Supreme Court cases. Those earlier cases have given the police broad discretion to search possessions on the person of an arrested suspect, including notebooks, calendars and pagers. The government contends that a cellphone is no different than any other object a suspect might be carrying. This seems like a perfectly legitimate complaint. This is a grey area of law and, since there is no relevant legislation, a Supreme Court decision is needed to clarify exactly the intent of the laws. Once made, the decision will establish precedent for all future cases. This seems like something where such precedent a) does not exist currently and b) would be immensely important. Also, not sure what this has to do with Obama, the justice department challenges circuit rulings all the time..."
Thanks Obama 
"If they are asking for permission, it means they are already doing it."
"Id say no. Like the article points out, modern cell phones house a wealth of personal information. We are basically carrying a PC around in our pockets. If that doesnt equal a modern version of papers, and effects, I dont know what would. It will come down, as it usually seems to do, what the Court decides is unreasonable."
Title is misleading. Its in situations of arrest. Not whether they feel like looking through your phone or not.
Just when you thought it couldnt get *any* worse...
The Obama Administration is no longer trying to hide their authoritarian ambitions at all. They are going balls to the wall trying to bring in a complete military dictatorship before his term ends.
This is completely wrong but I suppose I should be glad that Im too poor to afford a smart phone and the data plans they come with.

"Who the hell voted for Obama, and if its you, why are you complaining? Didnt you get that Chicago politicians lie? Did you believe all that hope and change crap? If so, you got what you asked for."
"Chill out, its just meta data anyways /sarcasm"
as if he gives a fuck
"Ladies and gentleman, a former constitutional law professor. Can we stop attaching that title to him as though it means anything?"
"Obama, the savior that forgot to save. "
No.
"You people voted for this terrorist piece of shit, now you deal with it. If you have to riot and tear down the White House gates, then you do it. Dont complain, take action."
Anthony Weiner was shamed for posting nudes on twitter. David Petraeus resigned because of an affair. He was linked to it via his email account. John Roberts changed his vote for Obamacare after receiving a call concerning the laptop he had sent in for work. These things mean something.
"i dont get it. when youre under arrest, dont they get your name and address anyway? can i really go out and do crime without a phone or ID, and then say uh, i dunno to the police when they ask me where i live?"
Just like thugs. Thats actually typical for a black guy to search someone for a phone. Why muricans you are not done with him yet? Chickens

You all still enjoying the president you were warned about not voting for? But you all bought into the bullshit speeches. Next time research your candidate before you vote idiots. 
Dont they already have all this information by other means?
"why the fuck do we even still have a bill or rights if the executive branch wants to side step it, the legislative branch does nothing when it is violated, and then Judicial rubber stamps the violating?"
"So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasnt much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didnt have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, See that man? Hes acting just like Jesus wants us to. For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I havent shaved in awhile so Im rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said Like Jesus? Maam Im an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all. As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment."
At least he asked this time
"Tip: for a little extra security and a little extra defensibility in court, encrypt and password protect anything. Its far from a solid defense, but I know of at least one case where a woman was protected from having to expose her password due to her fifth amendment rights."
This fucker was a [constitutional law professor](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/obama-a-constitutional-law-professor/)? Seriously? What the FUCK is wrong with him? Id pay money to see him try to defend this in a formal (not political but formal) debate.
More transparency from our lords and masters. Great.
Still bettet than romney.
The supreme court doesnt actually have that authority.
Land of the free.
Hows that Hope &amp; Change working out for you?
"For Obamas first term I kept complaining that he wasnt doing shit. Now I just wish he would stop doing shit. For the love of god the guy has no fucking clue about tech and rights! (yes I know he studied/practiced constitutional law, but you cant tell by his actions)"
Obama... youre breaking my heart );
This is it. This is the decision that swings things one way or another for a very long time.
"Crazy when Obama said he wanted to connect with regular Americans, he was actually foreshadowing his current manipulation of government."
"Obama is just doing his job to keep the country safe, I dont get what the big fuss is about. People want to be protected but then they whine over little shit like this. Its obvious most people have no clue how govt. works and just want to bitch and moan."
"Up to today Obama, Holder, and the Surpeme Court have shown no respect or regard for the law of the Constitution. We the people will have to wait until November 4th to select Americas savior. "
What in the fuck Obama.
"this is scary! so if this passes, being pulled over = my phone taken and searched through? if i have a password I guess it would be illegal to refuse entering it. I hope someone invents a way to wipe your phone clean via entering a special password like how home alarms work. "
I feel like a scumbag Obama meme is needed. Bloody hell when will this shit end?
"I mean hey, at least he asked this time."
Can anyone verify this? Theres absolutely no way they could even consider searching phones without a warrant legal... right? Even in our fucked up country no way.
"Remember, this has absolutely nothing to do with his constitutional obligation to defend federal law in court."
"Ill bite, I might agree to this if and when we have a 100% transparent government with no secret courtrooms. When I can see everything they are doing I might be a little more ok about it when they want to see what Im doing."
Im tired of Obama and his shit.

im not liking this Obama guy
"So we DO have a problem! &gt; If people can?t trust not only the executive branch but also don?t trust Congress, and don?t trust federal judges, to make sure that we?re abiding by the Constitution with due process and rule of law, then we?re going to have some problems here. - Barrack Obama "
[deleted]
Fuck this guy and the rest of the bunch. Van Holen can also bite it. Not voting Democrat ever again. Third party or republican. At least with a republican I know what I am getting and know how to set up for my financial future. The only way we win is to vote them out. 
We need a fucking Batman!
Thats such an egregious invasion of privacy Im speechless.
"Christ, does he have no shame at all?"
Id vote for him a fifth and sixth time.
Just repeal the whole constitution. Someone should try to do that just to make a point about how its pointless anyway.
"How much does having a lock code protect you? Can you be compelled to hand it over? It so, I can designate a family member to wipe my phone remotely in case I go to jail for whatever. Fortunately, I abide by the law. :)"

Well this is disconcerting
I think the misspelled *Stasi* because it says *Obama Administration*.
"...sigh.. I voted for Obama. Twice. And ever since that second time around Ive really really been regretting that choice. Can someone make me feel better about this guy because Im feeling pretty down about him being my president what with all this bullshit with the NSA, drones, warrantless shit, etc etc. "
"Christ, I cant stand these people. &gt;On the other hand, the Massachusetts case involves a primitive flip-phone, which could make this a bad test case. The specific phone involved in this 2007 incident likely didn?t have the wealth of information we store on more modern cellphones. Were only violating their constitutional rights a little, so thats okay. What, does that mean that they get to open just one letter every now and then, or search the shed on your property without a warrant, because, you know, its just a small violation?"
"Out of curiosity, the document specifically mentions: &gt; Whether the Fourth Amendment permits the police, without obtaining a warrant, to review the call log of a cell phone found on a person who has been lawfully arrested. Does that mean that the search would be limited to the Call Log section of a cellphone? Or is the term broad enough that the ruling would apply to email, text messages and any other files or documents stored on the cellphone? I mean, this isnt 1990 anymore. Smartphones are now the norm and can be used as the equivalent of a computer."
It is a very misleading title. It should be that the Obama administrations wants the police to be allowed to search cell phones of people who were arrested. That is a big distinction. Still they should not be able to search the phone without some type of probable cause. The only problem is the threshold for PC is so low the police will usually be able to meet the standard. 
So is this something that people on both sides agree is fucked up? 
I asks Obama to go jump off of a bridge
"Tell me how bad bush was again? You cant justify one murder by saying yeah I killed someone but another guy I know did too thats been every pro Obama argument Ive come across in the last 6 months. he had a chance to make a difference and with all that blathering on about how his hope and change would make the world a better place, Id like an apology from anyone who still defends him. Hope and change dont get you a job, get you an A in class theyre feelings and emotions not actions."
They probably know everything about me already so I dgaf.
Still happy you voted for this guy o-holes?
Classic Obama administration.
NO! you were supposed to ask them to allow Medical Marijuana! dumbdumbs.
Good news is that Hillary will be much better!
"Dammit Obama, I voted for you because you were a professor of Constitutional Law. How can you keep shredding the rights you swore to protect, you coward?"
Why do we have presidents who seem to want to be the worst instead of the best?
Obama has watched too many episodes of The Wire.
TIL: Obama is a dick. 
How about we all take a collective shit on the 4th amendment and call it a day
This is hilarious !!! Why ask now? They have been doing this for years.
"Is it just me or does anyone else feel like something big is coming? I mean not like a civil war but something else I cant quite put my finger on. I just feel like the US is preparing for something slowly,or maybe its just the weed."
So much for rights

did they really use that old motorola cell phone for the photo in the article??????
"I feel like this is bullshit. When I was 16, I had a little run in with my mother where she slammed my head against a wooden floor. I called 911 and the police ended taking the side of the adult in the situation so I ended up getting arrested and taken to the police station. My mom wanted me to take my cell phone with me so I had numbers and a way of contacting people if I needed to. The police acted like it was a good idea and it would be helpful for me. In fact, they encouraged it. Later, when I got to the station, they ended taking my phone, going through the contacts/text messages, and interrogating me on every other underage youth that had any kind of run in with the police. They even asked me why I was hanging out/knew such people and therefore I must be a troublemaker since I had them in my phone. I lived in a town with only one high school and it houses less than 2,000 students. It wouldnt be surprising to assume I knew most of the kids in my grade level. So, my vote is no on this one. I feel like its something that can and will be abused. Not to mention, I didnt even have a smart phone. I could imagine how that would have turned out. "
"Dont be mad at Uncle Tom, hes just doing what massah wants. "
"Hey guys, were just going need your John Hancock on this paper that nullifies the Constitution. K? Its all perfectly legal as long as their moms write them a note."
"The problem with a typical search during an arrest, is they can arrest you on any grounds. Then perform a search of your smart phone or computer and look for evidence on non-related cases. THIS is the problem and the reason for warrants to make sure abuse doesnt happen. If they need to search the phone/computer then a warrant is easy to get, hell the judges basically rubber stamps them now. All this does is make the cop state under perjury that the warrant is required to a related crime. We know that either party the Democrats or Republicans would back this. So why do you keep voting for them? Vote for people with a track record or a 3rd party. Ive stopped voting the two parties years ago, and its messed up some elections. If more people did that, Id bet they would take notice. Also, where the fuck is the Pirate Party, Id so vote for them as long as they leave my 2nd amendment alone... :) (Also the main reason I wont vote Democrat) "
the audacity of this man to try and take more rights in the light of what happened
Wonder when the government is going to check our underwear everday to see if we changed them.
And yet Teapartiers only focus on Nobama being a Demoncrat trying to take their guns away.
ruling that the police should have gotten a warrant before accessing any information on the man?s phone. Gotten is not a word. It is not a form of the verb get at all. grumble.
Obanoma is asking for things? Hahahahahaah.
"Knowing that Obamas favorite TV series is The Wire, I can see why hed want to give law enforcement this capability."
"Okay, they arrest the guy and charge him with selling crack. Why is it so difficult to ask a judge for a warrant to search his phone in this case? A judge would definitely allow such a thing. The only thing this does is allow police to make false arrests to make warrantless searches. Anyone can be arrested and held for 24 or 48 hours (I forget which) without being charged. Fuck Obama. Fuck him with a rusty chainsaw."
Obamas theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrgpZ0fUixs (added bonus: this video contains examples of bad taxidermy).
what. an. asshole. hes. become!
"A IV - The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

"I voted for this guy twice. I know that neither McCain nor Romney would have been any better, but fuck Obama for trampling all over our Constitution. "
"It is the many propaganda venues from the right which portray our current Democratic party as some kind of communists. This, even though the current Democratic party is little more than a slightly different version of Republicans. Example: Obamacare, which was a Republican proposal, written with the help of Republicans, almost all of it approved of by the insurance companies and other paid lobbyists, but using this as an example, the Republicans never do anything except oppose and make everything more and more in favor of the rich at the cost of the lower classes. Thats what they do."
"Im tired of this Obamacare was a Republican proposal myth being spread. It was not a Republican proposal. During the time that the Dems were batting around the idea of Hillarycare, some Republicans discussed potential health care reform. It was NOT Obamacare. This is why Obamacare got NO Republican support. http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/15/ellen-qualls/aca-gop-health-care-plan-1993/"
"Nah, you just made that up."
"Believe it or not, thats actually exactly what many groups do."
"Yep. Exactly right. In fact, when Obama quotes the 77 cents on the dollar figure thats exactly what hes doing. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-women-are-paid-77-cents-dolla/ That kind of shallow analysis is embarrassing."

you cant just make shit up
Apparently you can. http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/nevada.asp#KlUL3w5GhtlfxupO.99
Sure you can. He just did. 
"&gt; Gitmo remained open He tried, pretty much immediately, but Congress stopped him. Yes, he promised something that he didnt have the power to do, but at least he tried. &gt; we are still at war The Iraq war is over and thats all he campaigned on stopping. He never campaigned on stopping war in general, and did say that he planned on increasing efforts in Afghanistan. We may both disagree with it, but its not a broken promise. &gt; drone strikes I dont remember him ever campaigning against this, but youre welcome to educate me. &gt; immigration The ACA took too long and now he has an uncooperative congress. If anything, Im upset that he didnt live up to the idea I had of him in my head that he would be able to achieve things by bringing both sides to consensus. But somehow the right went more right, and consensus became impossible. Has Obama been perfect? No. But its also ridiculous to declare everything you *wished* for him to be as a *campaign promise*."
"In his Yes We Can Speech he explicitly says we will finish the job against Al-Quida in Afganistan. Regarding drone strikes he continually campaigned against Bushs foreign policy and counter terrorism efforts. Even if he didnt explicitly say drone strikes the point remains the same that he continued most of the same practices as Bush. So I think you characterization of my wishes as campaign promises is inaccurate. I could have went on, [Politifact lists 6 pages of broken campaign promises.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-broken/) So if you want to explain away all of those you are welcome to. "
"Its not 20% profit...its 20% overhead+profit....larger companies(the ones that will probably dominate the exchanges) have 85%-15% rule. Another thing is all the plans are the same, so apart from some brand loyalty or customer service ratings most people will gravitate toward the lowest costing plan(why wouldnt they o.o?) Im not saying your idea is a legit concern, but itd take a large collusion between the insurance carriers and the providers."
This is exactly what I was thinking. There is no real incentive to lower your costs rather then increase their expenses.
"This is the first thing I thought when I heard the 80% rule. If they cant get a larger slice of the pie, the only way to get more profits is to intentionally make the pie bigger. Hopefully competition will prevent this, but honestly I have no idea whats going to happen."
"State insurance regulators/commissioners still have to approve increases in insurance premiums. Unless you live in Flordia, where Governor Voldemort, nee Bat Boy, cooperated with the legislature to ban the state insurance regulator from regulating premiums for the next two years. The full story is a little more complicated, basically Florida was trying to force the federal government to regulate its insurance market. But as Obamacare is essential a federal assistance program for states to run their own insurance markets, the federal government does not have the power to regulate insurance in Florida. So in Floridas zeal to not implement Obamacare, they screwed their citizens into 2 years of unregulated rate increases. &gt;What resulted was Florida Senate Bill 1842, which among other things, suspended for two years the requirement that insurers get state approval for rates for new plans ? such as those that will appear on new marketplaces. Companies would still have to file rate changes with the state. But they could act on those changes without approval. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/08/ted-deutch/florida-democrats-say-gov-rick-scott-and-legislatu/"
"Not at all. Insurers can raise rates, and still maintain the 80% rule as long as providers charge more for services. Heres a simple example. Say your premium is $1,000 a month and you use $800 a month for cancer treatments. The insurance company profits the other $200. Now they want to make more, so they charge you $1,500 a month. But they have to maintain the 80%, so they renegotiate with your hospital to start charging $1,200 a month for your cancer treatment. Its a Win-Win-Lose scenario. Guess which one you are. "
"Better to ask that site, Im afraid I cant justify their numbers. Looking at politifact: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/30/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-medicare-overhead-far-lower-pri/ Apparently overall overhead is 10% but looking at it on a plan-by-plan basis, plans for large companies have lower overhead and those for smaller companies higher. 10% still seems high, but not nearly as obscene. (Not that I can point to absolute evidence of them only being 10% either.)"
"No, actually there is no study that supports the 40% statement. Show me a primary source document. "
"[Source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/17/louie-gohmert/texas-republican-rep-louie-gohmert-says-80-percent/) Gohmert said that 80 percent of Wall Street executives and their spouses donations go to Democrats. Gohmert would have had a stronger argument if he?d said that was the case six years ago, when candidate Barack Obama was vacuuming up Wall Street donations. The problem is, that?s no longer true. In fact, the exact opposite pattern has held for Wall Street donations during the past three election cycles."
"&gt;For the last 6 years campaign donations from corporations has come to republicans at 70%, and to democrats at 30%. Source?"
"That doesnt support your statement at all. In fact, it directly proves it wrong. You are pretending that the 2012 election is a perfect representation of the last three elections and you are pretending the investments and securities industry in that 2012 election is a perfect representation of all corporate donations. None of which is true. "
"So, what was wrong with [the Manchin-Toomey gun proposal](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/apr/30/summary-manchin-toomey-gun-proposal/). Just how much less could it have been?"
"From an earlier post of mine: &gt; Theres already a electronic background check called NICS that is used for every sale that goes through a gun dealer. However **private sellers are not allowed to use it;** they have no access. Weve got millions of people who would love a way to check whether the person theyre selling a gun to (or buying it from) is a felon, but all they can do is check the persons ID, write down the number, and hope. I suspect if NICS were open for the general public, then 99%+ of sales would involve a check without any legal requirement being imposed. &gt;If, for some reason, that proved to be inadequate, then there could be a law requiring private sellers use NICS. &gt;However, Democrats have only proposed a nationwide system of firearm-*registration*. Its not labeled as such, but if you outlaw private sales, and thereby require every sale go through a dealer, and those dealers must keep a record of every transaction, then youve just created a complete list of every gun that ever legally changes hands. People wouldnt be required to register the guns they already own, but within one generation (parents passing guns down to their kids) the lists would be complete, and yet its passed off as a minor act of closing some technical loophole. "
"&gt; Just how much less could it have been? 1. It could have opened NICS for public use, and done nothing more., OR 2. It could have opened NICS for public use, and required the private sellers use it, OR 3. Required sales go through dealers, and remove the requirement that dealers keep a record of their sales. &gt; what was wrong with the Manchin-Toomey gun proposal[?] The provisions against registration are toothless: - It says, ~ Hey, what were doing here is not a registration system dont call it one. - The AG is prohibited from consolidating or centralizing the records, but a complete list of every transaction must none-the-less be made across dealers and kept at their shops. - The AG is prohibited from seizing any records, except in the case of a crime (and if any guns are ever banned then their illegal possession would be a crime). Edit: Also, NICS requires too much information. Its fine to require whatever is needed to identify the individual , but a background check should not require the make, model, serial number, and caliber of the gun thats being purchased."
"Who pushed for the repeal of Glass-Steagall? Hint..it was a 12 year effort by Financial Interests and led by favored Republicans..like Phil Graham. And ...In March, we noted McDonnell was correct in saying 7 out of 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates in December 2011 had Republican governors. But we also found he was on shaky ground in attributing those results to GOP governors because three of the seven states were also on the 10 lowest unemployment list back in December 2010, when a Democratic governor had been in office for at least 8 years.http://www.politifact.com/virginia/article/2012/sep/11/do-gop-governors-create-more-jobs-democrats/"
"You like to say a lot of general statements without any evidence I see. Who repealed Glass-Steagall? Ill give you a hint, it wasnt a Republican. What states have higher unemployment rates? 70% of the states in the top 10 of lowest unemployment rates have Republican Governors. "
What about poverty rates underemployment rates?

"Cool, so hes kept a ton of smaller promises and largely ignored the ones that actually got him elected. "
Obama has not kept his promise to ___________.
"We do not have record deficit. The deficit has already shrunk by very large amounts in the last 5 years and is projected to continue. No one is proposing spending more overall, but rather on what do we spend money."
"Find me a fiscally conservative republican president since pre-Nixon. Republican presidents in the current era have WAY outspent the democrats. Its not even comparable. It was good ol St. Reagan who got us mired in debt and every republican since has wallowed in the ol trough of taxpayers money. So yeah, I have no doubt Ryan wants to cripple the poor after helping himself to social programs when it was convenient. He and the others will then turn around waste all the savings and then some invading countries to enrich Halliburton and the Kochs."
"Deficits have, in fact, dropped significantly under Obamas policies. Contrast that with the republican policies that ran up the debt and deficits to begin with."
If you want to see who accrued this debt you can begin with Reagan and W. The bulk of our current debt came directly from their policies.
"The US has a record debt and deficit. Democrats have no interest in cutting down that debt, they just want to spend more money. Ryan is as corrupt as most politicians, but he is doing this to cut the deficit of the US. Now that you accrued this debt, you guys have to either raise taxes or cut spending .. not just spend more."
"&gt; Democrats have no interest in cutting down that debt, they just want to spend more money. Well, we had [a budget surplus under President Clinton](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/). The last Republican President to do that was Eisenhower in 1956-57."
http://www.politifact.com/obama-like-health-care-keep/ Find me one quote in there that says that.
Unless the company changes it or your employer decides to change the coverage. 
"No. They just want to act as if he made them change it. Ya know, logic."
Was anyone really stupid enough to be thinking Obama was guaranteeing that private corporations would never change peoples health plans?
Yes I was making a joke... Also they were actually Reagan Phones before being overhauled by Bush
Especially Obama phones...

"[Then I guess Bill Clinton was in on the lie too.](http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/wmdquotes.asp) Edit: My point isnt that what Bush did was correct, but rather that Bush was telling the truth to the best of his ability.

He was trying very hard to convince Iran of this exact thing! "
"&gt;Splain, please. Are you a member of a **well-regulated militia**? Absolutely countries like UK, Australia are safer. I provided sources on homicide rates and the difference between the U.S. and the other industrialized countries is hugely significant. On homicide with guns, of course, the U.S. blows everyone out of the water. From [CDC:](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046149.htm) &gt;Overall, the data provided by the 26 countries included a total of 2872 deaths among children aged less than 15 years for a period of 1 year. Homicides accounted for 1995 deaths, including 1177 (59%) in boys and 818 (41%) in girls. Of the homicides, 1464 (73%) occurred among U.S. children. The homicide rate for children in the United States was five times higher than that for children in the other 25 countries combined (2.57 per 100,000 compared with 0.51) (Table_1). &gt;A firearm was reported to have been involved in the deaths of 1107 children; 957 (86%) of those occurred in the United States. Of all firearm-related deaths, 55% were reported as homicides; 20%, as suicides; 22%, as unintentional; and 3%, as intention undetermined. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S. children aged less than 15 years was nearly 12 times higher than among children in the other 25 countries combined (1.66 compared with 0.14) (Table_1). The firearm-related homicide rate in the United States was nearly 16 times higher than that in all of the other countries combined (0.94 compared with 0.06); the firearm-related suicide rate was nearly 11 times higher (0.32 compared with 0.03); and the unintentional firearm-related death rate was nine times higher (0.36 compared with 0.04). Yes, I am angry. I am angry that the special interest groups like the NRA have captured the US government in order to sell more guns at any cost. I am angry about gun nuts who vote on guns alone and paralyze and hijack the country. One person who votes based on NRA scorecards is one too many. &gt;There is also absolutely nothing Bloomberg could to do make him give me money. I almost agree with you. There are very few things Bloomberg can do to make me give him money. One of those very few things is taking down the NRA."
So youre mad at an organization &amp; feel the need to take it out on anyone that supports the 2nd Amendment. Got it.
"Youre wasting your time. There is no reasoning with a gun tard, they are so terrified of the world they cant imagine trying to live without them. Its funny, I know a lot of gun owners and no one has ever used one in self defense. But I know easily a dozen people who have been shot (some killed) or robbed at gunpoint by criminals with guns. Despite those daily occurances cowards still cant man up without a gun. Ask them how many school kids would need to get murdered and theyll tell you there is no amount that would dissuade them. Im a gun owner and ccw holder. Im one of rare ones who doesnt NEED a gun to feel like a man."
"Youre angry about the NRA? Use that on banks, the defense industry, the EPA, the FDA. Not individual rights. Direct that somewhere useful. You are creating new NRA members every time you come out railing to abolish it. Dont you see the irony?"
"&gt; Are you a member of a well-regulated militia? That is in no way an explanation, but Ill respond to it anyway. Technically, regulated under the [Militia Act of 1903](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_Act_of_1903), all able-bodied men between 17 and 45 can be considered reserve militia. That act was somewhat responsible to the formation of the [Civilian Marksmenship Program](http://www.odcmp.com/), of which I am a member. It does have requirements involving training to join. It was [created by congress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Marksmanship_Program) in 1903, and was formerly run by the US army. &gt; Absolutely countries like UK, Australia are safer Ehhhh.... Theres a reason people keep bringing up rape and assault. Its because youre more likely to be [assaulted in the UK than the US](http://www.nationmaster.com/country/us-united-states/cri-crime), [more likely to get raped in AUS,](http://www.nationmaster.com/country/au-austria/cri-crime\), and a bunch of other [not-so-fun](http://www.nationmaster.com/country/us-united-states/cri-crime) facts. At the end of the day, nowhere is safe from everything. We have more guns, but youre less likely to be assaulted in any other way. Also, those CDC numbers include suicide, and are therefore dishonest. The CDC wont publish numbers eliminating that number, because for a long time, the NRA pushed to disallow it. Again, fuck the NRA. &gt; ...to sell more guns at any cost. Look, the NRA does [not sell guns.](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/01/do-assault-weapons-sales-pay-nra-salaries/) any more than TV stations sell McDonalds food, and they [shy away from gun sales themselves.](http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/04/nra_great_american_outdoor_sho_1.html) They (NRA-ILA, that is) do, however, allow people to buy ratings, and they do donate money to politicians for favorable votes, they push for stupid restrictions, and their spokesperson is completely insane. Maybe lets not let politicians take money in exchange for votes anymore? Thatd solve a lot of problems all at once. Blaming the NRA for politicians behavior is like blaming McDonalds for people getting fat, or blaming the internet for goatse. It doesnt make a ton of sense. If youre going to hate the NRA, at least do it for reasons that are factual. As it stands, if the NRA says theyre absolutely not doing something, theyre likely not. If they dance around the issue, they unquestionably are. NRA members know that, which is why people who talk to the members usually have a hard time getting through to them. &gt; One person who votes based on NRA scorecards is one too many. Oh man, I cannot agree with you more on this. &gt; One of those very few things is taking down the NRA. Honestly, Bloomberg wont succeed at that. People like me might. People ask me why I havent joined the NRA, and I tell them in great detail. Im also not spouting off things that arent true (NRA SELLS GUNS TO BABBY WARGLEBARGLE) when I talk to them. Its way easier to have a conversation with someone when you dont tell them things that they know are incorrect. The sad part is this: I cant find a PAC regarding gun issues that isnt politically biased and all fucked up. Ive thought about joining the [pink pistols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Pistols), even though Im straight, but I cant find any records of their actions. If you keep up the anger when talking to people about guns, you wont change anything. Accuse someone enough of being a thoughtless single-issue voter, they might become one."
"&gt;Are you a member of a well-regulated militia? Yes, I am 18 years of age or older and I keep my weapon safely secured with a sufficient stock of ammunition. And I know how to use it safely and proficiently. ...You were using the original definition, right? The context that the amendment was written in? Or are we doing a little bit of historical revisionism?"

"They voted to repeal the ACA 46(?) times before they shut the government down in an attempt to derail it. This is how much they hate the ACA as is. http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/house-has-now-voted-46-times-to-repeal-or-dismantle-obamacare You can also add the fact that the red states didnt set up online state ACA registries like they were supposed to. Which, famously overburdened the federal site. http://crooksandliars.com/jon-perr/health-insurance-coverage-gap-coming-red-states Their dedication to derail healthcare reform is not in question. They are not going to welcome reasonable debate on the issue so they are always going to vote lock-step. Thats the problem. Now, since a single-payer bill was not passed its difficult to see how they would have worked to sabotage its implementation. But as they clearly demonstrated with the ACA, they would use every resource they have to bring it down. There is simply ways to affect laws after the votes have been made. They have demonstrated that too well. But let me explain why even the lack of votes is still their fault. Democrats that like insurance lobby money may vote the other way if the insurance lobby disapproved of single-payer, and likely yes, they would disapprove. However, votes lost by those Democrats would never be picked up on the Republican side simply because of their irrational lock-step voting. They are not using reason. They are not open to debate. They do not care for their constituents and openly lie to them about the provisions of the ACA. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/sep/24/top-16-myths-about-health-care-law/ http://www.politifact.com/subjects/health-care/ http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/nov/18/facebook-posts/obamacare-law-was-funded-and-expected-save-billion/ They only care for their own interests (whatever those may be) and those interests are obviously threatened by cheaper healthcare and a competent Democratic president. Now if you could convince Republicans to realize that Hey, maybe letting our countrymen afford food and medical care is a GOOD thing then maybe I would change my opinion on why they are the reason America is turning into a fascist third world country. I would also like to know how lock-step the Democrats would have been in single-payer scenario, but such is life."
They say that because many liberals consider Lieberman a republican even though he was the running mate of one of the most liberal presidential candidate ever on a major party ticket.
"Do you think there was no debate or editing of the bill before it passed? Democrats tried to compromise, with the patience and virtue of saints, and removed portions of the bill in making such compromises. They continued to make cuts until they finally realized that Republicans had no interest in compromise, but were just pretending, to stall the legislation further and remove its most progressive parts. The points you make dont prove they arent at fault for the removal of single-payer, it proves that they all lied when they told Democrats their approval could be won by making particular cuts. EDIT: Basically Democrats tried to pass the bill with bi-partisanship, except theyre really bad hagglers and also quite gullible."
"Because if they dont claim that, they have to defend beloved leader betraying the people."
"And yet the democrats were the ones that decided to go ahead without single payer. Were there underhanded tactics employed by both sides? Undoubtedly. In the end, you cannot blame the text of the law on a group that refused to go along with it. They passed the law knowing that there would be zero republican votes, their failure to make changes before they put it up for a vote rests solely on themselves. The republicans may have run out the play clock, that doesnt mean the democrats have any excuse for making their final play an intentional touchback."
"&gt; The problem is political. Single payer could have been passed if not for the Republicans. Ive been seeing this statement a lot lately. Care to explain how the republicans stopped the ACA, a bill that exactly zero of them voted for, from including Single Payer? Here is a bit from Wikipedia on the subject. *Senate:* &gt;On December 23, the Senate voted 60?39 to end debate on the bill: a cloture vote to end the filibuster by opponents. The bill then passed by a vote of 60?39 on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for, and **all Republicans voting against (except for Jim Bunning, who did not vote).** *Interesting side note, the vote was pushed through just in time.* &gt;Several weeks after the vote, on January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Senate in a special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters. ...(snip)... The second effect was more practical: the loss of the Democratic supermajority complicated the legislative strategy of reform proponents. *House:* &gt; The House passed the Senate bill with a 219?212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and **all 178 Republicans voting against it**. So, tell us again how anything in the text of the ACA is in any way attributable to the republicans? P.S. Any *argumentum ad hominem* you may consider regarding myself and possible political affiliation with the republicans will fall flat on its face. Fair warning."
"&gt;They voted to repeal the ACA 46(?) times before they shut the government down in an attempt to derail it. This is how much they hate the ACA as is. Yes, it is well established that republicans are against the ACA, they have been since the beginning of this whole debacle started in 2009. **That has nothing to do with single payer.** &gt;You can also add the fact that the red states didnt set up online state ACA registries like they were supposed to. Which, famously overburdened the federal site. This is a surprise how? Didnt all those red states say they they were not going to set up their own exchange, from the beginning. **Once again, nothing to do with single payer.** &gt;But let me explain why even the lack of votes is still their fault. Democrats that like insurance lobby money may vote the other way if the insurance lobby disapproved of single-payer, and likely yes, they would disapprove. However, votes lost by those Democrats would never be picked up on the Republican side simply because of their irrational lock-step voting. Just let me understand you correctly. Because some Democrats are corrupt (OK, just about every one of the 535) and would be afraid to vote for single payer, the fault lies with republicans that wouldnt support the ACA, much less single payer. **Is this seriously your logic?** &gt;They are not using reason. They are not open to debate. They do not care for their constituents and openly lie to them about the provisions of the ACA. **What they do after the fact has nothing to do with them not voting for the ACA in the first place.** Are you suggesting that there was any one person that understood the scope and all the benefits and pitfalls of the ACA? The law is made up of over 200k words, it references numerous other laws and codes, it makes hundreds of modifications to other laws and codes and there was little in the way of opportunity to read, much less understand the ACA. The democrats voted for the ACA on faith alone, relying on what their leadership was telling them what was in the bill. Had it not been for the upcoming supermajority loss, the democrats may have had time to understand what they were getting into. The fact of the matter is that the window of opportunity was closing and the democrats just wanted to pass anything they could claim as a victory and hope to make modifications down the road when it was too late to fight it. &gt;they are the reason America is turning into a fascist third world country. I would encourage your to become more familiar with words such as fascism before applying the label to a specific party. You may find that such a label applies equally well if not better to the party you are rooting for."
"&gt; The high net worth individuals are going to drastically skew this statistic, and then you turn around and average their holdings over the entire population of retired persons? For example, the 6 owners of Walmart control more wealth than the bottom 40% of the country combined... you cant just average that shit out like you are doing, its a flat out lie. I am skeptical of where they came up with the 40% figure. Net worth is the sum of assets and liabilities. From my research on official numbers, income is based on age, education, race, and gender. It seems that the academic economic articles I have access to link wealth and income together. What I mean by this is if you are in the bottom 40% of income earners then your net worth is attached to this. I am seeing mostly negative with this, but it is not a proper estimate of the true bottom 40% considering income, age, education, race, and gender are not organized in an appropriate manner. Based on statistics from the BLS, it would seem people with a bachelors degree have a median net worth of $142,518. The following median values compared with education should help explain why there is net worth disparity; No High School Diploma/Equivalent-$7,270, High School Graduate $42,223, Some College-No Degree $43,580, Associates Degree $58,861, and then college as stated previously. Based on these values wealth is concentrated with those who have earned at least a bachelors degree. This makes sense considering in 2012 30% of Americans held at least this degree. If you study the numbers as I have, you should see that net worth is based on education and wealth increases with age. As for the example you gave with Walmart, it does not seem ethical to use a $150 billion fortune on paper based on equity to show that somehow the poor are being punished. What should we do to high net worth individuals like the Waltons to bring the poor to a more affluent position? Obviously education and maturity will account for a large part of it, but what do we do about the 40 year old McDonalds worker or the 35 year old cashier at Walmart? I will agree that minimum wage should be integrated with the poverty level plus 15% and be tax exempt. &gt; Except for statistics that actually show 44% of the elderly would be in poverty without social security, and on average SS accounts for two-thirds of income for its elderly beneficiaries. The top 0.1% control HALF of all capital gains. Your fun with numbers is rubbish. Pretending the market and the federal reserves control over inflation is anything but a tax on the poor and a control of wealth is insanity. Social security pays out $14,760 before taxes. Why are we not thinking of ways to get out of this ponzi scheme? I would be much more comfortable investing my money where my returns would be much greater. Wouldnt you like to build your own wealth that you could give to your children and pass it down to your progeny? Poverty is based on income and not wealth. I am unsure of how accurate the 44% number is as well. If that is true then a lot of people did not use their incomes wisely or invested poorly. Also, do not event say that the top 0.1% control half of all capital gains. That is a completely misguided figure. Capital gains is the profit after selling a stock, bond, or some other security. Obviously the top 0.1% will move capital around in great amounts considering a large number of them. Also, you say 0.1% but you do not specifically state whether this is income or wealth. Tom cruise earned over $75 million (income) for his role in Mission Impossible III yet he is not part of the 0.1% wealth even though he is part of the top 0.1% of income earners when he plays in a movie. If you at all want to be legitimate you need to be specific and analyze outside of the talking points. I used to buy into the things you say but then I went to school to study economics and I was able to analyze better than I used to. Learn to do so yourself."
"... So what I got from that is everyone else has the numbers wrong, and you have them right. I would say you are only analyzing what you choose too. Clearly someone with an economics degree would have a vested interest in making the system inaccessible to those who dont, or at least controlling the perception of it. But hey, Id never say dont go to college... I just find it somewhat sad that were more educated than ever, and yet were benefiting less than ever from it as a whole. Be wary of the $1.2 trillion dollar loan racket that theyre running on it too. Apparently Walmarts wealth is some mystical paper based equity that doesnt exist in real life. http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/08/one-wisconsin-now/just-how-wealthy-wal-mart-walton-family/ Poverty is measured by earnings, unemployment compensation, workers compensation, Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, public assistance, veterans payments, survivor benefits, pension or retirement income, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, income from estates, trusts, educational assistance, alimony, child support, assistance from outside the household, and other miscellaneous sources. A little more than income... http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html &gt; do not event say that the top 0.1% control half of all capital gains. I did and you can. Its just a calculation of the capital gains on the sale of shares or property after 1 year http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2011/11/20/the-top-0-1-of-the-nation-earn-half-of-all-capital-gains/ &gt;Obviously the top 0.1% will move capital around in great amounts considering a large number of them. A large number of what? The large number of stocks and complete control of the wealth they own? Fricken duh. More than half of Americans arent even in the stock market. They are the poor smucks spending a quarter of their life paying down debt and providing the foundation so CEOs can make $7,000 an hour while bribing our politicians. &gt;. If that is true then a lot of people did not use their incomes wisely or invested poorly. No shit they didnt. That requires education and excess income to put into what many consider a huge risk that will be wiped away the next time the banks lose a gamble with public money. "

He has invested in stocks and in real estate, but no evidence that he has stock in the StarKist company that has a cannery in American Samoa. Also, the non-voting delegate from American Samoa requested they be excluded from minimum wage laws. AN EXCLUSIVE STRAIGHT FROM SNOPES."

"How is social security an entitlement exactly? Also, your statement shows a complete ignorance about its role in our financial problems. Social security has cost the county nothing. It is a hugely successful program with very little if any downside. Its the government that has borrowed FROM social security, not the other way around. "
"&gt;Your statement that social security has cost the country nothing is certifiably mostly false This article is missing an important fact. It points to 2010 and 2011 as years when social security ran a deficit but fails to point out that it is because the social security tax was temporarily lowered. If politicians would just stop fucking with social security it would remain solvent forever. &gt;Downsides include how most people paying into the program today probably wont get their benefits when they grow up This is purely because of the government borrowing from social security. It has nothing to do with social security itself. &gt;and the toll it had on the economy since all those payroll tax dollars would have otherwise went to the pockets of the workers How good exactly would tens of thousands of newly homeless elderly people be for the economy? Its funny how conservatives will use more money in workers pockets as an argument for helping the economy here even though it entirely contradicts every other economic argument they have. &gt;Also youre acting like the amount of money you pay into social security is how much you get back. In reality, most old people today will be getting more than they paid into it Thats the way an investment is supposed to work. Also, your employer pays half, so obviously you get more than you paid. &gt;nd also more than they need in a lot of cases (something kinda messed up about a poor kid paying payroll taxes to fund a wealthy octogenarians lifestyle, means-test that bitch). This is silly, theres a cap on social security, so it wont be funding anyones wealthy lifestyle. The poor kid is paying into it so that he wont become a homeless old man. "

They told the truth?
Violent crime when up after the gun laws passed in the UK and Australia. The only thing left to debate regarding that fact is whether or not you think the increases they experiences qualified as dramatic or not. That is a matter of opinion and you are welcome to yours. The fact that both countries experienced an increase in violent crime is not a matter of opinion however.
For starters the violent crime rate could dramatically increase as it did in both the UK and Australia when they passed there strict gun laws.
"Theres a lot of hyperbole in this statement. Take Australia for example - for one thing, Australia has not entirely banned guns. They have a gun ownership of something like 5%. Murder overall is below pre-gun ban levels, and while violent crime overall is net up, its gone down from the peak and overall its hardly what one would call a dramatic increase. http://www.snopes.com/crime/statistics/ausguns.asp http://bill4dogcatcher.wordpress.com/2012/12/20/bogus-australian-post-gun-ban-crime-info-floating-around-the-internet-and-on-facebook/"

Obama certainly intends to leave the current system intact. **But at this point, it seems too pat to say, If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.

But when someone makes a numeric statement like $Y budget hole or X jobs created if Politifact cant understand the numbers, their truthometer is faulty. "
I think they just try to appear non-partisian so when something comes along that might level the playing field they jump on it.
"despite his fancy chart, DEMBRO doesnt prove it, one way or the other.. im surprised reddit upvoted this at all, mods are slipping"
"No, this is obvious partisan pandering. Texas created 33% of net jobs - Rated TRUE - Based on shit math, resulting in a misleading interpretation. 29 states dont ban employment discrimination based on sexual orientation - Rated HALF-TRUE - Based on the idea that this FACTUALLY CORRECT STATEMENT doesnt tell the whole story. Politifact is bad and we should feel bad for discussing them. End of story."
But its ok if politifact talks up a democrat right? The only time you children argue and refute about a source or claim is when it is favor of a republican. 
"No - Ive seen them tear down dems in cases and agreed. But data is data, math is math and politifact often screws up their understanding of the math. "
"But if you say something that is factually true, youll only get half true. Actually fudge the numbers? TRUE!"
"Sadly, we need a checking organization like Factcheck.org to do a check on the checking that Politifact does. Ugh."
"Politifact got the meaning correct and the guy you upvoted got it wrong. The ratio has meaning in all the examples he gave and the meaning of the 33% is clearly what Perry intended and implied. From my reply to that post: &gt;With a positive denominator, this is how you usefully interpret the ratio, X. &gt;X &lt; 0 Texas was a drain of this relative proportion &gt;X = 0 Texas neither gained nor lost a single net job &gt;0 &lt; X &lt; 100% Texas was responsible for this proportion of job gain &gt;X = 100% Excluding Texas, the nation neither gained nor lost jobs, but Texas gained jobs &gt;100% &lt; X The nation, excluding Texas, lost jobs, and this is the relative proportion of Texas gain over the rest of the nations loss &gt;If the denominator is negative, the ratio still has meaning, except that the meaning is the exact opposite of what is above, so the denominators sign must be stated to be negative. **Over the last five years, for example, we can say Texas was a buffer to net lost jobs, but only replaced 21.2% of the total net jobs lost across the country.** "
Exactly right. Defense spending is covered in the Enumerated Powers;health care is not. 
"What does that have to do with OPs question??? Also, you seem to have forgotten just how many Dems (including Obama, including Senator Clinton) voted for those wars and to continue them. Iraq was under a Repub President but was supported by the Dems as well."
"State and local republicans are just as against health care, education, welfare etc as those on the federal level. Trashing entitlements are easy points from their base. And the federal republicans have NOT been pushing a mainline states rights platform at all. "
"If the Feds waited for states to get around to it there would be no Social Security, Medicare and Food Stamps. You cant trust a state overrun with extremists to make policy fair to the people living there. Case in point: The South."
"Conspiracy theories aside... Repubs believe military is a federal government matter. Healthcare, Education, Welfare, etc, are not. Those are state and local matters, if matters for government involvement at all. For most Repubs its a matter of the governments Constitutional powers (or limits thereof). Simple as that. I now return you to your regularly scheduled Republican-Are-Evil thread..."
Believing the military is a Federal matter does nothing to address how they use that military lol. It doesnt address why they dont see Iraq as the colossal waste of resources it so obviously was.

As articulate as your username.
"Just because something is a federal law or power doesnt mean it Constitutionally is. Case in point, Education. The federal government doesnt even pretend they have legut authority in this arena. Instead they circumvent the Constitutional issue and extort the states. It basically goes like this: Okay, since we cant make laws *requiring* you to do what we want youre free to disregard our standards and expectations. However, were going to take money from all states for education and give it back only to those states that do what we want. I believe Nevada, for example, was the last state to get oon board with NCLB. For a llong time they paid into it but the money went back to other states because they refused to tow the line. Its bullshit maneuvers like that that upset Repubs. If jts not within the Federal governments authority then they shouldnt be able to extort states into doing what they want. Edit: If your point was how much Bush expanded those areas, I wont argue with you. Bush wasnt just a bad president. He was a terrible Republican as well. But presidents on both sides are known to go against their party at times. Clinton and Dont Ask, Dont Tell? Clinton and welfare reform? Clintons example doesnt suddenly mean Democrats arent the party of gay rights and welfare any more than Bush means Republicans arent in favor of limited federal power."
"&gt;State and local republicans are just as against health care, education, welfare... So quickly we forget about Mitt Romney."
"&gt;Simple as that. No, not really. Healthcare: &gt;[The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Prescription_Drug,_Improvement,_and_Modernization_Act) (also called the Medicare Modernization Act or MMA) is **a federal law** of the United States, enacted in 2003. It produced the largest overhaul of Medicare in the public health programs 38-year history. &gt; &gt; The MMA was signed by President George W. Bush on December 8, 2003, after passing in Congress by a close margin. &gt;Its most touted change is **the introduction of an entitlement benefit** for prescription drugs, through tax breaks and subsidies.

"&gt; Hes referencing federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws. You know, the ones the current Prez said **hed get rid of while campaigning.** Youre wrong. He didnt say that during the campaign. As [FactCheck.org points out](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/10/obama-soft-on-crime/) &gt; More recently, an Obama-Biden fact sheet on the campaign Web site says that Obama will ?reform mandatory minimums,? but it specifically refers to drug offenders, with no mention of sex offenders and murderers. The fact sheet reads: Obama and Biden ?will immediately review these sentences to see where we can be smarter on crime and reduce the ineffective warehousing of nonviolent drug offenders.? Obama made a similar statement about sentencing for ?nonviolent? offenders during a speech at Howard University in 2007, but again, there was no mention of sex offenders or murderers: [Corroborating source from CNN](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/23/fact-check-does-obama-oppose-mandatory-prison-sentences-for-violent-criminals-and-drug-dealers/) As for results: * http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/300/reform-mandatory-minimum-sentences/ * http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/299/eliminate-disparity-in-sentencing-for-crack-and-co/ [As for current news, the issue is gaining some steam in Congress, ya know - where the laws are supposed to be made](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/congress-relax-mandatory-prison-terms-20276091) &gt; Attorney General Eric Holder has shown interest in working with Congress to make permanent changes in sentencing laws.

"&gt; The interviewers specifically ask was this a terrorist attack? and Obama COMPLETELY dances around the issue. He said that there was an ongoing investigation into the matter and they would get to bottom of who was responsible. I have the exact quote in the post you just responded to. You cannot deny that he said the words act of terror. That is an indisputable fact. Why is that inadequate? Why is the distinction between act of terror and terror act so important, and what would be different if he had said terror attack? &gt; when he spent weeks blaming a citizens YouTube Video. Week. [8 days.](http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/19/obama_official_benghazi_was_a_terrorist_attack) Until the CIA investigation confirmed that it was in fact a terrorist attack. And again: What is the problem. Seriously. They had an initial assessment which was wrong. They repeatedly stated that it was an assessment that might change with new information, and when the CIA investigation confirmed it was a terrorist attack, they changed their assessment. The talking points given to Rice had the references to AQ removed by the CIA. The administration confirmed the attack was by terrorists a full **48 days before the election**."
"The Obama administration had a huge edge over Mitt Romneys campaign when it came to national defense/foreign policy. This was that they were beating the terrorists (eg. killing Bin Laden), something the Bush administration could never do. The President used this talking point repeatedly in the national debates with Romney. The scandal is whether or not the Obama administration covered it up in order to keep this edge in the Presidential race. In my opinion, its fucking wrong to manipulate something as tragic as this in order to win a political position. At what point do we, as Americans say this is enough? When will we have a system that truly works for the people? Enough of this political bullshit. Oh, and what is happening with the IRS now is very similar to what Nixon was doing. For the record, I couldnt care less about liberals or conservatives. Both suck equally."
"You would have to be pretty hellbent on tearing down obama to say that. &gt; We want to send a message all around the world ? anybody who would do us harm: **No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world**, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America. If we are really at the point in American politics where saying act of terror instead of terror attack is an earth shattering scandal, then I weep for journalism. Obama said immediately afterwards: &gt; Well, it?s too early to know exactly how this came about, what group was involved, but obviously it was an attack on Americans. And we are going to be working with the Libyan government to make sure that we bring these folks to justice, one way or the other. Its almost unfathomable to me that this is a scandal. well update if we get better information and then they do. Well I guess its time to impeach, obviously."
"Right, because FactCheck is so hellbent on tearing down Obama, right? &gt; Between the morning speech and the evening fundraiser, Obama spoke to CBS News reporter Steve Kroft of ?60 Minutes.? Kroft noted that ?you went out of your way to avoid the use of the word terrorism in connection with the Libya attack.? Obama said, ?Right.? Asked why, the president said that ?it?s too early to know exactly how this came about.?...... &gt; Even after his director of the National Counterterrorism Center labeled the incident a ?terrorist attack,? Obama declined to call it that at a town hall meeting on Sept. 20 and during a taping of ?The View? on Sept. 24. He also appeared Sept. 18 on ?The Late Show with David Letterman,? where he blamed the anti-Muslim video for the attack in Benghazi. ?Extremists and terrorists used this as an excuse to attack a variety of our embassies, including the consulate in Libya,? he said. (For more details, see our extensive timeline of the Benghazi attack.) &gt; As we said in our timeline, the Obama administration displayed an abundance of caution when publicly discussing the possibility of a premeditated terrorist attack ? but did not show that same level of caution when saying without any evidence that the attack in Benghazi started as a spontaneous demonstration of an anti-Muslim video. Like, have you watched any of these interviews? The interviewers specifically ask was this a terrorist attack? and Obama COMPLETELY dances around the issue. You have to be a complete shill for Obama to think he actually referred to it as a terrorist attack from day 1, when he spent weeks blaming a citizens YouTube Video. http://factcheck.org/2013/05/benghazi-attack-revisited/ "
"&gt; The scandal is whether or not the Obama administration covered it up in order to keep this edge in the Presidential race. No. It isnt. That isnt even a question anymore. [The CIA stated that they removed references to AQ before it went to the State Department.](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/12/04/166467881/report-benghazi-talking-points-watered-down-by-cia-not-white-house). Some reporter claimed that he had seen emails that said otherwise, but as weve just learned that wasnt true. But besides that, besides the facts that disprove the *conspiracy*, the accusation that the president was trying to downplay terrorism to win the election doesnt make any logical sense. Benghazi was attacked **two months** before the election, and the Obama administration confirmed it was a terrorist attack [on Sept 19th](http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/19/obama_official_benghazi_was_a_terrorist_attack) A full **48 days before the election**. It makes no logical sense that would somehow be a boon to his election. What is the political advantage of delaying confirmation by a week? Every statement that was made by Rice on those sunday talk shows was prefaced with: &gt; Our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present - &gt; We?ll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that?s the best information we have at present. It was an ongoing investigation, and when the investigation concluded *more than a month before the election*, they confirmed that it was a terrorist attack and [began the process of tracking down the suspects](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/fbi-benghazi-attack-132733889.html). &gt; In my opinion, its fucking wrong to manipulate something as tragic as this in order to win a political position. Mitt Romney made a statement condemning the president **[while the compound was still under attack](http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/09/12/833301/romney-obama-sympathize-attackers-libya-egypt/)**: &gt; It?s disgraceful that the Obama administration?s first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks. &gt; At what point do we, as Americans say this is enough? When will we have a system that truly works for the people? Enough of this political bullshit. Please explain to me in detail how it is political bullshit to say: We have an ongoing investigation on the matter, right now, our best guess is X. Then after the investigation concludes to say: Our initial assessment was incorrect, it was Y. What you are implicitly arguing is that the CIA should not have the authority to filter what information is broadcast to the world from its active investigations. I would like to hear a specific justification for this opinion, and why its appropriate for police to decline information during an ongoing investigation, but not appropriate for the CIA. --- &gt; Oh, and what is happening with the IRS now is very similar to what Nixon was doing. Okay, so this is extremely off topic, but no it isnt. What the IRS did was wrong, but there is no indication that Obama had any connection to it. The filters were set up by mid level auditors, and the director in charge during this period was put there by Bush. Obama condemned the actions of the IRS. Please explain the similarities between that and Watergate. --- &gt; For the record, I couldnt care less about liberals or conservatives. Both suck equally. You do. If youre still asking questions about cover-ups and watergate for this situation, then you are making an effort to ignore the answers. The rather banal facts are that some crazy fucks killed an ambassador, and that is terrible, but nothing couldve really been done differently. (other than allocating more funding for embassy security, which the congressional republicans declined to do)"
"To be fair, considering that he was a Wartime President (granted, nothing in either Iraq or Afghanistan wouldve been able to even get close, but still), he was probably holed up in a bunker put under said ranch for a good portion of that time. The White House is a pretty damn juicy target, after all, and people are pretty sure it was going to be United 93s landing pad. Hes still either completely fucking clueless or one of the most warped people ever given the title, though. Depends on his level of participation with his handlers game plan."
Out of the 8 years he served...he spent half of it at his private estate. He wasnt much of a president honestly. It was basically just showing face and running off to his private ranch. Puppet president.

"&gt;Yes it does. Workers whos income is reported via W2. Not students. Not retirees. Student-aged who work, is my point. I suppose that was unclear. I definitely filed a W2 working through college. And theres no way that graph is excluding student-aged workers with that total work-force number. &gt;According to the BLS, out of all teenagers in the US, on 4.5 million total are employed at any pay rate. That represents less than 10% of the total number of people earning less than minimum wage annually. Teenagers, age 16-19, is not the entire demographic I refer to. College age easily extends to 22-23. Bureau of Labour Statistics refers to youth as 16-24, which Id argue is still young enough for the point. Using the definition I used originally, and not excluding the entirety of college age students, that number rises to [19.7 million employed between the ages of 16-24 during july 2013](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/youth.pdf). Using your numbers that would equate to approximately ~40-50% making less than minimum, not 10%. &gt;If you make an assertion you have to back it up with data. The average age of a fast food worker is 29. Many, not most. Posting something like you did, saying 32% of workers earn less than annual minimum, without differentiating *at all* between age groups, is misleading. Because that number falls to 19% (still too high but not near as bad as 32) when you account for youth, who are to be expected working in the crappy sub-minimum jobs/minimum jobs. I already acknowledged that there are people who have the issue of both being older, and having shit happen (or nothing good happening) that leads to them being in crappy jobs. And that number is too high, but thats a different discussion. &gt;In order to retire, you must save for retirement throughout your career. People need to always be saving for retirement. It is (literally) exponentially better to start saving for retirement at a younger age. Of course, but unless we are expecting these youth to be stuck in shitty minimum wage jobs, which is possible for a fair amount, relying solely on savings from &lt;$20,000 isnt going to do much, even including social security. Especially accounting for any increase in wage, as small as they would be, over the course of their working careers (I do not see someone starting at ~18 not improving their income in at least a mediocre fashion over their working life, nor do I see them keeping the same job). &gt;Its also an issue for the people who cant earn a decent living their entire lives. The average retirement saving is only $43,797, and 36% of retirees have nothing saved for retirement. I specifically said ...cant find work/better jobs. Why did you ignore that? I have no issue with the fact that wages are too low for too many people, but I have issue with using statistics in minimum wage discussions that do not take into account the people who are expected to make minimum; the untrained, inexperienced youth (the fact that its pathetically low for some areas is a different discussion, as well). Its similar to using jobs created without taking into account what types of jobs, or income growth without taking into account who obtained said income. Theyre statistics that are too broad to be appplicable for the discussion and using them in this fashion is more about pushing a view, not supporting an argument. Saw it all the time in economic articles/essays. "
"&gt; It does not discriminate at all between different groups of people. Yes it does. Workers whos income is reported via W2. Not students.

"Per your point about supporting families and retiring that number is stupidly inflated. It does not discriminate at all between different groups of people. For example, how many of those are teenagers? College students? Just graduated and in the midst of looking for better work? Many of these have no need to support a family, nor would they be relying on this income for retirement at such a young age. This (livable wage) is a larger issue when people lose their jobs later in life, cant find work/better jobs, or other shit happens events. Youre presenting information like a politician, and it really detracts from your point. Though if you cared about this in the first place youd have checked things like labour rates by age and such. TLDR Many, many people in your statistic shouldnt be having families before they even finish school, nor should they be thinking of retiring so young. "

"Politics is everything, but unfortunately that is just the nature of the game. For example the unemployment extension debate that is currently going on. Democrats let the budget pass without an extension of the unemployment insurance because now it is all the press is talking about. Now they can play up that Republicans dont like the unemployed. Republicans have shifted from repealing Obamacare, to bills that a lot of people can argue as fixing some of the problems with the bill. 2 weeks ago, they picked up 67 Democrats and yesterday they picked up 30 to vote yes on the bills, despite opposition from the administration. These numbers will likely increase as many Democrats will have to try and run elections on Obamacare that didnt have the most popular of starts, so now they have to be able to distance themselves from it and claim they are fixing the issues. Despite these, there has been a partnership from both sides to try and get back to regular order. Both sides have people who are dumb, a lot of people want to move forward to help their constituents and get back to normal order. "

Does this poll mean that 61% of republicans and 58% of democrats care for nothing but winning?
I call bullshit!
Further proof that a majority of each party will follow WHATEVER their party is in favor of doing. 
Reminder: Not all conservatives are Republican and not all liberals are Democrats. Many Americans are neither.
And 98% percent of those Dems will change their tune when theres a Republican in the White House. Theyre all (all of our politicians) a bunch of douchebags. Except Warren - shes fucking awesome.
Ask the same question with a republican president and youll get a different answer.
The real problem is that any % of either party supports this shit.

"The numbers were flipped under Bush, IIRC. Does that mean about 30% of Americans are party hacks?"
"This is just not true. The supporters are in government. Every democrat Ive spoken to is against warrantless searches. The only ones Ive seen support it are the congressmen and administration heads trotted out to speak in defense of these programs. Al Gore, Howard Dean, Michael Moore and a host of other democrats not in office are vehemently against this simple minded unconstitutional dragnet. Democrats need a united front on this or theyll lose a large portion of support come next election. There are some of us who voted for Obama because he pretended to be anti-patriot act."
People support anything when their side is in office. Everything is a victory and evidence of their teams superiority.
"With the broad possibility of blackmail of media groups tempered with the chilling effect of the domestic spying program, I decline to believe anything that the major media produces in the way of stories and/or polls. About this poll; sorry, not buying it. Fraudulent polls are designed to create doubt in peoples minds and make them feel as if they are on the edge of a general belief. I have well over 50 progressive acquaintances and about the same number of moderate conservatives - and they are *all* completely incensed over this. "

"And if there was a Republican Administration in power when this stuff broke, the poll numbers would be opposite. The sports team mentality that plays into politics is precisely why *nothing ever changes,* regardless of which party is in power. Until the drones of *both parties* (aka the base) is willing to abandon the party elite to do what is right versus what theyre told to believe, these types of polls will be absolutely meaningless."
"I havent met a single person who supports it, and I live in a Democratic haven."
Curious how this this splits based on age.
Just shows people treat politics more like a sports team then a group that can affect their freedoms and livelihoods.
"I am putting it out there, this poll would be COMPLETELY different if Bush was still in office because people are sheep who flock to their team in a pinch. This is why this countrys government cant get anything done. "
"Oh how times have changed.

So the same terrorists who plan to harm innocent Americans and their freedom worldwide would be coddled, if we followed the Democrat plan. "
propaganda. dont believe the hype.
"The reverse was true during the Bush years over warrantless wiretaps. This same poll also seems to be a stunning difference in comparison to the ones that Gallup and Pew released last week which showed Americans overwhelmingly in favor of spying, whereas this poll seems more evenly split. Ive never heard of this pollster before, though, and at least Pew tends to have solid polls (not so much Gallup in recent years), so I think its still not a given the way the public as a whole leans on the issue, but it does seem like partisanship is motivating a great deal of the Democratic base on this topic."
"This pole was taken two weeks ago, less than a week after the initial Guardian story broke. Quite a bit has happened since then. I would be shocked if the numbers were the same today."

But Im also an academic researcher... maybe there are poorly educated Democrats Im not meeting in life that dont know much about government/political histories across the world and the value of our Constitution? As it stands, this poll seems way off. I also dont know a single self-professed Republican that supports PRISM-style programs."
What the fuck Americans.
"This is the sort of loyalty bias that made me decide not to declare a party affiliation. Even though I never vote Republican, I feel that not labeling myself as Democratic makes it easier to criticize the Democrats when they arent progressive or liberal enough."
"I stopped identifying with either of the two major parties a while ago, which is nice because now I dont have to change my opinions depending on which party happens to be fucking us over at the moment. "
"what democrats are actually supportive of this? I just dont see how PRISM could be argued as a benefit to society. (please dont give me the national security rhetoric. if you still believe that, you arent paying enough attention)"
Those numbers make a decent majority. Keep shaking your fists on the internet though.
You could say the thing about Dems. How do you explain 58% of Dems supporting this bullshit?
Funny when liberals were up in arms after the same disclosure in 2006 it was just the opposite. Partisan influenced opinion is all this poll is measuring at this time.

Additional measures go further, including **photographing the hacker using his own system?s camera, implanting malware in the hacker?s network, or even physically disabling or destroying the hacker?s own computer or network.** &gt; Additionally, software can be written that will allow only authorized users to open files containing valuable information.

Republicans see NSA scandal as a chance to attack Obama. Its all about the upcoming election.
"Ah, Reddit cant handle the fact that sometimes democrats are wrong and republicans are right. Seriously, the comments in this thread are really childish."
"What the fuck, 58% of Dems? The fucks the matter with you guys?"
Im not sure Democrats are clear on what theyre supporting. If the questions were rephrased to ask if people support widespread domestic surveillance without a warrant and that spying was being done by contractors with limited oversight I doubt seriously youd get 58 percent support. 
I am one of the among 58%.
"Thats because registered party members see the issues as damaging or helpful to the partys future electoral success. This is why the numbers have [swapped](http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2013/06/11/democrats-republicans-switch-views-on-nsa-surveillance/?mg=blogs-wsj) since 2006. They dont actually care about the spying per se, just about the implications in future elections. Republicans see it as a way to win seats, while Dems are afraid it will lose them seats. This is also why Dems are distancing themselves from the President - Both voters and elected officials. Its more interesting with the Republican base though, because they actually dont see anything wrong with the methods, just who is doing it. I just read a top voted comment on BreitBart that praised Snowden for exposing Obamas tyranny while also calling Bradley Manning a homosexual traitor. "

"This should probably be clarified: 39% of Republicans support spying by Democrats, 58% support spying by Rs. And vice versa."
I bet if you broke down support by conservative/liberal instead of republican/democrat the results would look quite different.
That... was unexpected.
"Nearly every Dem in congress and the White House, for starters. Schumer, Feinstein, Obama, etc."
Ask that same question 8 years ago when W was running things with Chertoff as the head of the NSA. 
Lets call it even and remember that both a Democrat and Republican president presided over these programs presumably with full knowledge of their inner workings. 
"I am NOT saying I support this program. I am saying that I think most of the people who hate it, are going waaaay to sinister on motives for why we keep it. My bet is we are using it to kick ass with state on state espionage and counter espionage. For every retard with a pipe bomb they smack down, they are catching or flipping operatives of other countries. I think there is a reason the international fallout was as big as it was. With PMs saying stuff like Irelands did. We can all scoff at the effectiveness of Prism to stop jihadis but my guess is its rolled a metric shit ton more of people looking to flip, sell secrets etc etc. Its been the European reaction that makes me think this. America has been hypocritical on tons of issues before, but rarely do we get full on called to the mat about them as we are now. There were massive protests about Iraq all over the globe but few leaders really got in Bushs face over Iraq. So why, with no protests and a pretty mild reaction globally within their own borders are the leaders seemingly so pissed? Why? Because Prism is all over the net. Theyve figured out just how much of their spy game we are tapped in to. If the system works as stated, amazing encryption wouldnt even be able to hide a spy because all it would do would be like seeing a nuclear weapon launch, a giant neon sign saying someone from this IP is up to something. "
you mean to say that people that identify as republican and democrat are machines programmed to root for their team? im shocked.
These numbers would be flipped if all this came out with a Republican in office. All these numbers are telling us is party affiliation. 
Democrats blindly follow Obama even though he is the worst president we have ever had just like Republicans followed Bush no matter what when he was president (worst at the time). Why not Libertarian? Heaven forbid you actually break away from what those parties tell you to believe.
"Many have been rightly arguing that this result says more about Republican partisan opposition to the Obama administration than it does opposition to the policy itself. But from that standpoint, Democrats under a Republican administration would oppose the policies just the same. These statements further a partisan divide when what it also means is that conservative and liberal perspectives on civil liberties are coming toward agreement on core constitutional values, in opposition to those authoritarian perspectives held by the center in both political parties. Any political movement that could force a change in these policies would need broad support across the populace. An organized left/right coalition in opposition to Democratic/Republican party control thus represents a real opportunity for change, the kind of opportunity Obama promised and yet squandered. This could be viewed as a Bernie Sanders/Ron Paul type ticket. Two men who would always hold divergent views on a range of political issues, and yet both hold similar core values on civil liberties. Libs and Cons need to start making tough choices over division versus unity, given the potential for tyranny this national security state apparatus portends. "
I call bullshit..cuz I smell it. 
Then why didnt they stop it?
Makes sense as a large part of the democrat platform is to build a nanny state. 
Disgraceful how many support it. 
How can you have an opinion on a secret?
Aaannnndddd...those numbers were the exact opposite in the years following after 9/11 under Bush.
How is this on /r/politics?
Idiots.
OBAMA OBAMA!!!!
People are too stupid and just pick their horse. They never want to look at the horse itself.
And 100% supported it when Bush was president.

Only 39% of Republicans support PRISM-style domestic spying *while a Democrat occupies the White House*.

"Yeah, you cant really trust Republicans to take polls honestly."
"Because unlike the neocon super libertarian George Hitler Bush, Obama explained why the NSA non-scandal was constitutional and legal. "

"So embarrassing. Let it never be said that us Dems, like the GOP, doesnt have its way to large share of mindless partisan lemmings. "
I wonder what % of Republicans would support it if it was done via trans-vaginal ultrasound.
"Forgive me if I am wrong, but doesnt that go along with party ideals? Reps want less federal government, Dems like more. It makes a bit of sense that people who support larger fed government would be ok with said government using programs like these."
"Depends who is in power, will depend on who supports and who opposes. "
"One thing is people tend to rally around the flag when they feel their country is being attacked . The other is what Snowden did is legally and morally indefensible . If he had stayed in the county , if that intelligence hadnt made its way into the hands of the Chinese and the Russians , if he had followed the path of Daniel Ellsberg it might be a different story , but thats not what he did. If Ellsberg had taken the Pentagon Papers to Russia or China and allowed himself to be used as a propaganda tool against his country he would be remembered as a traitor . "
Why would anyone support this? 
What it really proves that conservatives are more consumed with fear (see other articles that actually [prove that with MRIs](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201104/conservatives-big-fear-brain-study-finds)) than more normal people Its all about those tin foil glen beck paranoids 
these poll results sadden me almost as much as the mass surveillance does
"I just dont want warmongering Republicans using it. Because theyll use it to attack political enemies, and theyll make it accessible to corporate partners like Halliburton, ExxonMobil, and Blackwater."
Partisanship FTW.
"One thing to consider: Democrats are significantly more urban voters. Im an otherwise liberal democrat who generally supports broad anti-terror activities. I also ride the subway to my job, located in a major tourist destination. I cant think if another way to say this and I dont mean this in a negative way: I think its easier to oppose these programs when its not as likely to effect you in a positive way, just like the rich opposing universal healthcare. This is a common rationale amongst my friends, and Im willing to bet that between that, reassurance from reliable voices like Al Franken, and the modest checks and balances (FISA courts, Congressional input), most Democrats are willing to accept these programs as the balance between libery and security in the early 21st century. Obviously caveats apply (why/how did the Boston bombers get through this? How did a loose cannon like Snowden get a job?) The NSA story is not new, and its been in the public domain for years even if not well covered or paid much attention to. The president intends to curtail the AUMF and the Patriot Act. Theres a balance here, and Ill gladly accept President Obamas rationale here, particularly when I so strongly support other aspects of his platform. "
"They dont support it because Obama is in the White House. They LOVED it under Bush, so all these polls actually reflect is that they are brand loyal, not policy loyal. And honestly, the same might be true for Dems."
"This isnt a problem. Democrats are pro-big government. Something like Prism is totally in-line with what dems are supposed to be doing. Shit like this happens when their *only* opposition takes a train to crazy-town and stops acting according to their base. If the Republicans were doing their fucking jobs, the Democrats wouldnt be able to get away with this kind of shit. Instead, we get 40-ish attempts to repeal a fucking health-care bill, and a war on/against marriage/women/christanity that makes no fucking sense."
That sounds about right.
"&gt;SS is not welfare, it is a earned benefit. Really? How much did you and your husband put in over your lifetime, versus the benefits you will draw? Hint: less. Newsflash for out-of-touch seniors: EVERYONE IS ON A FIXED INCOME. The difference is you have, most likely, far less expenses than I do. No kids to feed. No college loans to pay off. No mortgage payments. And Im thankful for what I have every day, because I am EXTREMELY lucky for my generation.

"That sucks. But if Social Security had been invested in the broad stock market instead of being spent by the govt as soon as it receives the money, youd have a couple hundred percent more income. Would you like a couple hundred percent more income?"
"It is not earned income - the benefits you receive/received far outweigh your contributions. It is a social welfare program, not a retirement savings program."
"When a household is entirely dependent on one member for income, the common practice is to get life insurance for that member. The exception tends to be if youre willing to go out and work for yourself. Whats odd here is your husbands age. These days, the youngest WWII vets are in their mid 80s, and low as social security payments are, its rare for an 85-year-old to have a job paying 20x. The average social security payment is ~$14,000 per year, so that puts his job well into the $200,000 range."
And no life insurance?
"Get a job, slacker."
You dont get widow bonus in America?
"Your husband served in WWII? So, youre like in your 80s and posting on reddit? And if you really are an 85 year old woman posting on reddit, good for you. SS is a Ponzi scheme of income redistribution, perverted now by both parties into scaring elderly people into voting a certain way. And since many old people vote Republican (baby Jesus trumps all!), the party that would see your benefit stripped away, theres even more irony. Also, the income cap taxed for SS is around 110k. Income over that isnt taxed for SS, and thats the demographic that has enjoyed almost all of the prosperity and growth in wealth over the last 30 years. While the middle class is gutted. Tell me, how well do you think SS can do when the middle class that used to be able to support it is replaced with a large lower income class that makes less than $10 an hour? That math is pretty scary, dontcha think?"

"No matter how he and his colleagues got elected, his point is ridiculous. Because Republicans have the House now does not entitle them to revisit every law that is on the books and change or nullify the ones they dont like **by fiat**. They are, of course, free to offer legislation to change those laws, but since the House is currently the only Republican-controlled body in government, they cant expect that every thing that they want is going to be enacted. -------------- *Edit in bold to clarify my intended meaning.

Wouldve = would have. Not would of.
Who controls gerrymandering and why is that so much better for republicans and couldnt democrats do the same thing?
I dont understand how gerrymandering doesnt carry a significant jail sentence. How is it not purely election fraud?!
You should finish that thought. Gerrymandering was only possible because of the GOP landslide at the state and local level in 2010. The GOP landslide at the state and local level in 2010 was made possible by the passage of the ACA without one single republican vote. TL;DR: Things happen for reasons.
"Meh, both parties gerrymander, the Republicans are just better at it. The state I live in, Maryland, is a prime example of Democrat gerrymandering. "
"I like his argument how he thinks nobody cares about the House, while he is essentially saying he doesnt care about the Senate, the President, or the Supreme Court, or the voters."
"I like how he keeps saying the republicans won the house in 2012, only because of gerrymandering. If it wasnt for that the democrats would of controlled the house too. "
"Would have. And no, studies have shown the republicans won the house with the old boundaries (and only would have won 5 less seats)."
"Whats also hilarious about his statement is that [a majority of the electorate actually voted for Democrats](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/). But like you said, gerrymandering..."
"Thats some good shillin, boy."
"A lot of the above statements only argue against [straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) criticisms of the law. For example, yes, it might not be the largest tax increase in the history of the world--[but it is still a large tax increase.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/10/30/delay-obamacare-website-congress-obama-health-care-column/3315785/) I posted this elsewhere, but there are many legitimate criticisms of the ACA (I dont necessarily agree with them): 1. For those who can afford insurance, the way the ACA redistributes the costs of health insurance is unfair, e.g. [forcing men to pay maternity coverage,](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/does-obamas-health-care-law-make-men-pay-for-maternity-care-breaking-down-the-facts/2013/10/31/5db80b90-424a-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html) or by [forcing healthy/young people who make responsible personal health decisions to pay increased premiums above what they would otherwise be charged to subsidize those who have made poor health decisions,](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=0da040a5-45b1-415a-85a2-dee11befb911) like the obese etc. 2. [An unprecedented peace-time expansion in government power, that sets a disturbing precedent.](http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/08/the-individual-mandate-an-unprecedented-expansion-of-federal-power/) Whereas penalty-enforced mandates to purchase products from a private business had only previously applied to elective activity (e.g. if you drive on public roads, you need insurance, etc.), the only condition to being subject to the ACA mandate is *being alive*. There isnt a convenient way to opt out of this, and opens the doors for other corporations to lobby to get the public to buy their product at the federal level. 3. [For people who have an Originalist view of the Constitution,](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/originalism-vs-obamacare/) the ACA is unconstitutional and a violation of the rule of law which many people like. 4. [It cuts Medicare to a certain degree,](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/19/tom-cotton/sen-mark-pryor-cut-medicare-pay-obamacare-says-rep/) which is alleged to not necessarily have any negative impact due to the way certain provisions of the ACA fill in the gap, but people dont like the idea of losing control over the medicare theyve felt theyve earned. [People also liked the medicare advantage programs which are now nonviable due to the ACA.](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/obamacare-cuts-bite-medicare-advantage-225400802.html) 5. The economic and regulatory effects of the ACA are [to reduce competition in many markets](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/29/trouble-for-obamacare-in-new-hampshire/), which serves to boost insurance company monopoly power. And with the mandate, people cant opt out. 6. People like the privacy of their medical records, and people worry that [the incentives to report data to the government in the ACA](http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/Stage2_MeaningfulUseSpecSheet_TableContents_EPs.pdf ) could lead to [abuses observed in other similar systems,](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/11/28/disabled_woman_denied_entry_to_us_after_agent_cites_supposedly_private_medical_details.html), or are just uncomfortable in general, like the naked body scanners at airports. 7. If any of a laundry list of delicate, tendentious assumptions are not met, [the ACA will increase the deficit and national debt.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/28/news/economy/obamacare-deficits/) 8. [The ACA intends to flood the healthcare market with millions of new consumers (increase demand), but does nothing to alleviate the healthcare *supply* issues (e.g. the doctor shortage),](http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/02/health/obamacare-doctor-shortage/) thus with demand increasing and the supply staying the same or shrinking, prices are going to rise more than they otherwise would. 9. In order to cut prices down as much as possible to still have prices that appeal to consumers, insurance companies (since its now illegal to trim benefits now mandated) [must decrease the size of their networks to compensate.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/14/news/economy/obamacare-doctors/) People are going to lose access or their doctors. 10.

Because employer plans dont get the same government subsidy support as individual exchange plans, [companies will either be unable to afford, or will have an economic incentive to drop employee healthcare plans.](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304795804579097422592424860) 12.

"Yeah, I threw that in because Im not an unconditional Obama supporter by any means. I definitely feel like a lot of other young democrats that, through the short view of things at least, his presidency has not lived up to our expectations (for a lot of the reasons I outlined above). I didnt want someone to come say well there is x, y, and z that Obama could have done something about and didnt like I didnt know that already."
"I really dont think its about that at all. I genuinely believe that Obama was an authentic guy, and he really believed that he could effect change. But the political reality in DC is that while the President *can* technically do things outside of Congress, doing that ensures that Congress will not be amenable toward working with the President on their common grounds first. So what tends to happen is the President and Congress work on common issues first (which may not be very many), and small incremental changes are made to the status quo. That said, Obama has realized there is very little that he is going to get help from Congress on, so he *is* leveraging his executive power to do things like raise the minimum wage for federal contractors. But overall, those are also weak reforms that can be easily reversed by the next executive, whoever that is. (Oh, except drones, lack of meaningful Wall Street reform, NSA spying on Americans, record number of deportations, etc. That stuff doesnt count..........)"
"I agree with the majority of this post but I dont know that the last line is completely fair. Granted up front that Obamas failure to rein in the NSA is a broken promise and something that should be held against him and his legacy. On the other hand, he has both proposed and pushed for Wall Street reform on several [fronts](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/422/create-new-financial-regulations/). Candidate Obama did not come out against [drone strikes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/05/john-fleming/should-obama-apologize-policy-shift-drone-strikes-/). And while he has set records for his number of deportations he never promised to stop deporting people who broke the law, only to push for immigration reform to change the law, something he has done on several high profile occasions, even taking major heat for instituting a diluted form of the dream act through Executive order."
"&gt;Government doesnt operate more efficiently than private ventures... History shows this. Yeah, like fire departments. Fuck you, your American exceptionalism, and your blind corporatism."
Wow. Dont get upset. The statement that the us is not every other country is a fact. I didnt say it was better... I said it was not the same. we have certain unique issues in our legal system that need to be resolved 
"People always make this point but dont examine the motivation behind it, which is essentially a profit motive. Efficiency of a company does not = reduced cost to consumers. The profit motive in the medical industry is why costs are so inflated. So what is the proposed alternative or counter-pressure to balance that out? The only decently supported argument Ive heard is the public option that provides a counter pressure to inflating costs because of their bargaining power. There hasnt been any plan forwarded within congress that made any public arguments for eliminating privacy of hospitals billing practices, setting ceilings on allowable charges, etc... So what else is going to apply pressure to hospitals and the like to push back on suppliers that inflate the costs because they have 0 consumers to answer to? As much as conservative principles decry any tampering with an open market, we dont even have an open market with healthcare to begin with. Were all bearing the burden of doctor pay, privatized hospitals, insurance and medical suppliers who are in a closed loop with one another. So Obamacare is not an optimal solution, but what are the alternatives that have been seriously proposed within government? "
"The US is not every other developed country in the world. Insurance companies are FAR from the only problem in our health care system. Just swapping out insurance doesnt make costs magically drop. Notice, the public expenditure on health is already higher han most countries total expenditure. How does changing that private section to public make it disappear completely? Government doesnt operate more efficiently than private ventures... History shows this."
Did you read it? They ignored a bunch of costs because it falls under other branches of government and double or tripled the estimate for private insurance. When you take into account all costs for medicare and look at a few other studies on private insurance... They get within a few percentage points of each other 
"&gt; Government doesnt operate more efficiently than private ventures... History shows this. For shits and giggles, go look up the operating overhead for Medicare.

Didnt know insurance companies were running infinite profit margins... Guess I should get in the business.
"&gt; Government doesnt operate more efficiently than private ventures... History shows this. Actually what history shows is that blanket statements like this are completely false and nothing more than simple bits of ideology. Public modes of action have different properties than private ones, and the same goes for different goods and services. Treating everything as a commodity doesnt mean that magically the private sector is going to run it more efficiently."
Because changing it from private to public removes the hundreds of billions in profit currently in the system? It isnt magic.

How about revolting when SCOTUS has effectively turned our government into a full-fledged oligarchy? Taxation isnt the problem. Its how those tax dollars are spent. Thats what we should be revolting about. Troll Scalia. 
"Aside from the taxes thing, probably the biggest problem I have with Scalia is his originalism. I understand the tension of describing the foundation of our legal system as a living, breathing document, but the fact is, if the Supreme Courts views did not change with the time we would still have segregation and no voting rights for many different groups. Not to mention I would not consider Justice Scalia an Originalist. Justice Thomas, I think, is much closer to an originalist. Scalia will definitely bring his conservative values to the forefront to justify many things he disagrees with. See: Gonzales v. Raich. He would never take such a broad view of the Commerce Clause (and necessary and proper clause) had the topic not been Marijuana. "
Another remnant of a decadent past. 
I hope the student asked for Scalias home address.
"What if Scalia is actually the ultimate agent provocateur, and for years hes been steadily stripping back the veneer of democracy so people will see their system for what it is?"
"The man is a disgrace. Revolting against the US government is not a Constitutional right. In fact, this is why we have the 2nd Amendment - to put down armed rebellions against the United States government. Plus, the US Constitution is a living, breathing document. Hence, why the founders gave us Amendments. If the US Constitution was not a living, breathing document, then there would only be 10 Amendments etched in stone, much like the Bible. This man is such a fucking disgrace. Like most Conservatives, I cant wait until he dies so the world can become a better place. "
"Or You know, you could just vote. Even supreme court justices are publicly advocating for this cult of fascism that the right has embraced. In which you kill anyone you disagree with."
"I get that we wouldnt want to change the Constitution every other Tuesday and Im glad the requirements to change the Constitution are restrictive, but my problem with originalism is there are 17 amendments (not including the Bill of Rights). Clearly, the Constitution isnt set in stone. "
If anything would be productive by revolution it would be getting rid of Scalia. 
How about if we have a corporate stooge Supreme Court? Perhaps we should revolt then? 
"Yeah kid, if my generation has administered and legislated this badly, you should just revolt - my friends and I are old and rich! We dont care about anything except that!"
"Hey Scalia, Considering that one of the catchphrases of the American Revolution was No Taxation without Representation, how come you arent in hiding after the McCutcheon decision? Hed be one of the first people up against the wall this time around."
Is he jealous of Vladimir?
Hes just spitting in our faces at this point. 
"&gt;Scalia said that the justices aren?t swayed by partisan political spats, and that he doesn?t care which party controls the White House. I dont believe him. This is how it is *supposed* to be, but believing that it actually *is* that way would require me to ignore a long running series of rulings that fall essentially along partisan lines. There are some exceptions. But legislators cross the aisle, sometimes, too. The same could be expected of a partisan SC."
"Or if the rich buy elections, or mass transit is forbidden (as they just did in Oklahoma), or legislators deny the dangers of climate change in the name of profit, corporations pollute the water and atmosphere in the name of profit, banks and speculators defraud the people and the government, maybe those are ground for revolt too."
"sometimes i see things like this and i think: maybe the gun nuts are right i like to think non-violent revolution can work, i like to think that petitioning the government will work. then i remember that the indians sued the federal government for breaking their treaty, they acted within the law, they followed the procedure...and then andrew jackson spit in their face and forcibly relocated them. so ultimately it comes down to power, the indians didnt have it, so the federal government felt no reason to listen to them. occupy didnt have it, the tea party did. here scalia is saying it, the government doesnt care about you unless you have power and show a willingness to use it. i dont think the gun nuts have enough power though. they have guns, which might work in some cases, but the government has more...a lot more. one need only look to waco to see how well a small militia with guns do against the government. we have the power of the vote, thats our strongest power. unfortunately we dont have the power to pick our candidates, that is decided by the donors, least in presidential elections, i believe its simpler in congressional elections (which are this year btw) so we either need more means of citizen involvement...or more guns. lots more...and maybe rocket launchers too. Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.~jfk"
How do you solve a problem like Scalia?
They know that we are a bunch of ignorant pussies and they aint scared of us.
"The Prien isnt the Taxes, its that debt is so profitable"
I dont see his remark as a problem.
"Hmm inciting an insurrection to revolt against the government, by a government official. Why does that sound so treasonous to me?"
"Scalia is a complicated man, and although he does much that elicits my disgust, he also occasionally gets things more right than most. What I find more revolting than even the worst of Scalias decisions, however, is the degree to which people on this forum hold as absurd the notion that people may at some point find themselves in a a position where the correct action is to use force against their government. The concept, even when viewed entirely as a hypothetical, removed from present circumstances, registers to many as an impossibility, an always false action. "
How about 0?
There was no income tax until 100 years ago.
A sitting supreme court justice FOMENTING revolution? A letter writing campaign needs to get underway to our senators for them to begin impeachment hearings.
This remark should result in Scalias expulsion from the Supreme Court. Its a tragic shame that John Roberts lacks the integrity to expel this ideologue who jettisoned his judicial objectivity LONG ago.
Inciting terrorism is a felony.

Like it would be different with democrats. 
This generation would never revolt. Those useless fucks cant get a double shot mocha expresso in a trench.
I think a Supreme Court Justice calling on a citizen to revolt should be grounds for removal from office
It is literally not legal to speak what I just thought.
Do supreme court justices not realize they are part of the establishment? 
Students should revolt when they cant afford to live and go to school? The sad part is this is coming from a Supreme court judge not a fringe radio talk show host or political extremist...
Just fucking speechless....what the heck will come out of his mouth next.

Can you link to that information? Because all I ever heard that voter fraud is really not nearly as common as republicans say it is. It happens but not enough to sway an election.

Seems to me a little belt tightening and tax increase should solve the problem. 
"I am not an expert on this governor but have been following the news about Wisconsin. Im by nature distrustful of most politicians, and Im no fan of Scott Walker, however I actually took the time to read your linked article. I find myself agreeing with some of these tax cuts for example longterm capital gains and the short term rollover exemptions. The first part encourages the longterm investment in Wisconsin, not to mention generally longterm profits is severally eroded by inflation and capital gains on longterm does not take this into account. The short term encourages the churning of cash and this roll over effects overall robustness of business as profits arent cashed out but plowed right back in. The tax breaks for manufacturing and employment are complementary to each other and discourages outsourcing and reward creating local jobs. This is all I have time to respond to as i have a kid to put to bed, but again my original statement was a general application of common logic not ncessarily specific to this situation. Im also sure there may be some chicanery somewhere in the the actual details but on face value it not completely a disaster. "

"How is my mentioning of Voter ID laws a fail just because a Democratic state did it too? Does that nullify all the actions conservative legislative bodies have taken to enact these laws? Is that like saying that its okay for bankers to steal money from poor people cause you know some guy who pocketed something at a garage sale one time? Poll tax issues **could** be solved by making IDs free to those who are poor enough, but by the time you fill out the paperwork and get a response back, the election could be over (yes, I know people should register well in advance, and college students shouldnt write research papers the night before, some things are unlikely to ever change). Im not trying to say its a brand new idea that the Conservatives have just thought up, but they are using it to influence how the election will turnout. This is similar to the proposed ideas to make every district reward its electoral vote independently of the rest of the state. Thats not a new idea, two states already award electoral votes to each candidate. But cherry-picking the states that would implement this (which would give the Republican Party a win in an election theyd lose the popular vote in) seems to fly in the face of democracy. As for your map, what it that supposed to prove? I see my state, as well as several others offer no early voting of any kind. But look at all the states out West that are green! Yeah, many of them go Democrat in elections, those that dont usually dont have a sizable urban poor population so they are not germane to the discussion. The problem with this chart is that they generalize the information. Offer Early voting up to a month in advance - Green! Offer Early voting on the Friday before the election - Green! Theres more to the situation than that, and so it needs a more detailed map. If it helps, I dont think you personally are trying to suppress poor urban voters. "

Fail. http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/03/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-rhode-islands-voter-identificatio/ &gt;One of the first states in the union to pass voter ID bill was Rhode Island, 85 percent Democratic legislature, she said. And who pushed it? A black Democrat in the house, a black Democrat in the senate. Thats a fact! &gt;We look at Coulter?s one-of-the-first claim in a separate item; here we examine the claims of minority legislative support. &gt;And the facts show Coulter is right. &gt;In the Rhode Island Senate, the bill?s main sponsor was Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, an African-American. The House version was co-sponsored by House Speaker Gordon Fox, the first black lawmaker to lead the state lower chamber, among others. &gt;Further, the bill got a crucial boost when state Rep. Anastasia Williams, D-Providence, who is of African -American and Panamanian descent, also supported it. &gt;She testified about how she suspected someone had voted in her name in 2006 (no complaint was filed) and how she?d once seen a man vote twice at her local polling place. Any issues with regard to poll tax can be solved by making ID free to those who are poor enough to qualify. In most of the places where they have passed the ID laws, I believe that they do this. Regardless...this is not a new, Republican thing. http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx Check it out. &gt;so a lack of early voting means choosing between voting or getting in trouble at work, perhaps even fired... http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx Look at that map.

"Voter ID laws. Voter Fraud has never been a big enough issue to change an election outcome, so the push for Voter IDs seems to target a section of the populace who do not drive and havent bothered getting a Non-Drivers license. Or at least, they havent renewed the one they got a decade ago. Many of the urban poor work multiple jobs (and yet are still poor due to the lack of a livable wage, supporting a large multigenerational family, or a drug or alcohol addiction used to deal with their crummy life) and so a lack of early voting means choosing between voting or getting in trouble at work, perhaps even fired. While these laws dont specifically target the urban poor, they do more significantly affect that demographic than others. Im sure other Redditors could give you other examples of urban poor suppression, probably related to the defunding of Planned Parenthoods or something. "

Republicans would prefer if the poor and minorities would just stop voting. Since they stubbornly continue to vote they just have to make it harder to do so.
You resident liberals are hilarious. I love the wild tangents you go on and the conspiracies you help fabricate because you cant stand the fact that not everyone votes for your party. Its hilarious. Watching this sub slowly turn more and more extreme is gratifying. I get pleasure out of your miseries.

Yeah because the democrats have been so on board with ending the drug war. 
"Seriously, progress towards legalization has happened in spite of the Democrats, who have done nothing. It almost pisses me off the way they are trying to own this issue now that it has broader support. But I cant be too angry when Im getting what I want. Going forward, the Repubs will be the biggest hurdle for legalization. "
Im not terribly worried about this. It seems that half the country would revolt if this was ever ratified and they tried to enforce it.
The this was a hyperlink you idiot. Literally the first word.
"I would say its more a huge problem lurking in the background right now. Its not panic-mode yet, and probably wont be for some time, but that this is effectively the UNs plan to control Americas gun legislation (because lets be honest, the vast majority of UN countries already have laws that are as strict or stricter) is spooky enough. Realistically its not something that will probably ever end up applying to the United States - *however*, the fact that the UN is taking shots across the bow at the US, attempting to solve its so-called gun problem for them is what is worrying. As soon as I saw the countries listed on the front cover I went oh this is going to be *great*."

It doesnt immediately bring all those laws to America. It doesnt change any American law on the books.** The significant part of the treaty deals with clamping down on international arms trade, which is a huge problem. Theres a reason the only countries to vote against the treat were Iran, North Korea, and Syria. "

I like this legislation
"All of these sound very similar to laws we already have in Germany. Except maybe for such modern and complicated stuff like the ballistic fingerprint database. But yes. You cant simply carry around a loaded gun, if you dont have a reason for it. Either a specific threat (e.g. being a courier for valuables) or hunting. You need a specific licence for both. And of course there are no military guns sold here or a secondary market. You cant just sell your gun to anyone. And we recently introduced legislation about gun storage security. If you want to shoot guns for sport, there are pretty severe restrictions on what you can buy, where you can store and how you can transport guns and ammo. And we also have a lot of guns in circulation in Germany. And also school shootings. But a **lot** less criminal activity involving guns. And, of course, less accidents. But I dont think the legislation makes such a huge difference on these things. And I also dont think the legislation is such a big deal. If you want to own a gun, you can still do so. Its not the end of the world. Its just different. And, in part, very sensible. If a country is not as developed as the US and Europe. These provisions are there to develope a legislation system similar to European countries as opposed to the US. Which could be useful. Not everything the UN does is about the US, you know? Actually very little is. The UN is mostly a tool for powerful countries to impose their will on less powerful countries (the US mostly get what they want). Instead of the other way around. And it is still preferable to the alternative. Because powerful countries will always impose their will on less powerful countries. The UN simply provides a structure for it. And lets the less powerful get a word in. So they can at least feel like they had a say. This is called diplomacy. And why do you believe any of these measures will make it past Congress? Isnt that the real unrealistic thing?"

"Good thing were not talking about the UNATT, were talking about ISACS. Furthermore, quoting Snopes on gun control issues. Yeah, might as well go ask Dianne Feinstein."
"Yes, you are correct, but the anti-gun side relies heavily on rhetoric and a sense of peer pressure. This is why, since Ronald Reagan started it, they keep abusing terms like common sense, because it implies anyone whos against their plan has no common sense. They talk about the children... anyone whos not anti-gun therefore hates children. They talk about how 90% of Americans want this, despite the fact that thats at best an exaggerration and at worst an outright lie. Theres a leaked anti-gun [playbook](http://washingtonexaminer.com/democratic-anti-gun-guide-urged-using-trayvon-martins-death-to-hit-nra-guns/article/2533972) that spells out that this is their plan for passing anti-gun legislation. If the ISACS becomes an actual thing in the UN, it allows them to bring international pressure on the public as well. Talking about how the United Nations and the rest of the civilized world supports these laws can be a powerful piece of language. You could just as easily ask why ISACS and the UNATT even exist in the first place, then, if they are just non-binding papers with words on them. But then again, the UN being the inept agency it is, I guess that sums up most of what they do: words."
"But those arent laws or legislation, and theres nothing binding the US to passing that guidance. Also, it would never even pass in the US either way. &gt;This document provides guidance on regulating, at the national level, civilian access to small arms and light weapons, including their parts, components and ammunition. It provides guidance on regulating the possession by civilians of certain categories of small arms and light weapons; regulating the use of small arms by civilians; and preventing the possession of small arms by civilians who are likely to misuse them. This document is meant to be of use to regulatory and licensing authorities of States that are seeking guidance on drafting laws, regulations and administrative procedures to control civilian access to small arms and light weapons."

"So he gets one sentence wrong and nobody can get over that fact. Lie, misspoke. Who the eff cares. There was no order from the president to cancel peoples insurance plans. It was the insurance companies themselves that chose to cancel plans instead of updating the services offered to be compliant with the ACA. Let me repeat: Insurance companies CHOSE to cancel peoples coverage rather than update that coverage to be compliant with the ACA. Additionally, many of these plans were so lousy they didnt even meet the basic standards of care outlined in the ACA. These are plans that never should have been sold in the first place."

"Like most Republican and Democrat politicians, they were opposites in speech only. Their history in public service showed that they would be very similar as presidents.

Is Obama the POTUS?
"The majority of what you wrote, was insignificant. Just because he appointed the first woman, or first african american something, or because he had a few acts of petty social reform. Does not mean that he has bettered the united states in any way. The way I see it, his two true accomplishments were obamacare and osama bin laden. The way he is dealing with Syria is just plain laughable. I voted for Obama and boy do I regret it."

Im not sufficiently familiar with this matter. Please cite the specific policy document (e.g. an executive order).

"&gt;Obamacare is literally his legacy. That is an utter falsehood. While the PPACA is certainly the Presidents landmark signature legislative achievement, there is much more to his legacy. * Before the end of his term the POTUS will issue a decision on the completion of the transnational portion of the Keystone XL pipeline, a crucial matter to environmentalist groups (Jim Hanson has called the exploitation of the Alberta tar fields game over for global climate change.) * The appointment of SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ELENA KAGEN. This judicial appointment will, quite obviously, effect SCOTUS decisions and express the legacy of POTUS Obama for *decades*. * The appointment of SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR (the first Hispanic SCOTUS justice, creating the potential for a first SCOTUS Chief Justice of Hispanic descent.) This judicial appointment will, quite obviously, effect SCOTUS decisions and express the legacy of POTUS Obama for *decades*. * The POTUS has made MANY other judicial appointments which can be viewed [HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Barack_Obama#Supreme_Court) * POTUS Obama is negotiating THE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. Anybody who has ever heard of NAFTA can understand that trade agreements have an impact long past a POTUS term. * In 2009 the Credit CARD Act passed congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law. Opponents of the law have blamed it for rising interest rates, while supporters of the law have noted dramatic reduction in repricing practices among major credit card providers. * The POTUS appointed the first woman to the office of US SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, the former Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano. (The impact of that administration on the legacy of POTUS is multifaceted and I will not offer an analysis of the same on that basis.) * The POTUS appointed the first African-American man, ERIC HOLDER, to the office of US ATTORNEY GENERAL. (The impact of that administration on the legacy of POTUS is multifaceted and I will not offer an analysis of the same on that basis.) * POTUS Obama has appointed numerous civil servants, some of which were historic in some way (e.g. first appointee from a special class as with ERIC HOLDER) * POTUS Barrack Obama signed into law the the AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This action was highly controversial politically, with opponents blaming the act for the rate of recovery and many other problems, meanwhile supporters of the action credit the stimulus with ensuring the recovery. * POTUS Obama signed into law the DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, the legacy of which cannot be assessed in full until the process of rule-writing is completed. * POTUS Obama (among many others) lobbied the SCOTUS successfully to nullify provisions of the DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT, the resultant decision was widely received as a victory for the POTUS and marriage equality activists. * Under POTUS Obama the policy of the US ARMED FORCES with respect to LGBT Americans serving (openly) was rolled back. This policy was colloquially referred to as Dont ask, Dont tell. This decision was widely received as a victory for marriage equality activists. * POTUS Obama has overseen the declassification numerous documents related to FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT and related SIGINT programs in response to media reports and unauthorized disclosures. * POTUS Obama has maintained the timeline established under the administration of POTUS GEORGE W. BUSH for the WITHDRAWAL OF US TROOPS FROM IRAQ * POTUS Obama ordered a raid on Abbatobad, Pakistan which resulted in the death of OSAMA BIN LADEN. This was seen as a violation of the sovereignty of the Pakistani state by the Pakistani public and the POTUS publicly admitted that relations with Pakistan suffered dramatically after the attack. The attack has been lauded by US media outlets and was the subject of a Hollywood feature film in 2012 (Zero Dark Thirty.) * POTUS Obama adopted and normalized facets of the BUSH DOCTRINE, especially regarding preemptive war. Under the POTUS, this adapted doctrine has been referred to as the JUST WAR DOCTRINE. POTUS Obama spoke about the JUST WAR DOCTRINE in his remarks to the Nobel Prize Committee which you can read [HERE](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-acceptance-nobel-peace-prize) * POTUS Obama expanded the use of UNMANNED VEHICLES IN US COMBAT OPERATIONS. The POTUS discusses the use of drones in his LANDMARK SPEECH AT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY which you can read [HERE](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university) and which you can view (it was interrupted and the POTUS did improvise some remarks which do not appear in the prepared transcript) [HERE, part 1/6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLF_LtqhHEE) * POTUS Obama has maintained operations at the GUANTANAMO BAY DETENTION CENTER, citing congressional obstruction. * POTUS Obama ordered US forces, in conjunction with coalition forces, into action during the LIBYAN CIVIL WAR (also called the LIBYAN REVOLUTION.) * POTUS Obama has prosecuted a more-or-less clandestine military action in SOMALIA, in conjunction with African Union forces. * POTUS Obama posed the question of intervention in SYRIA to congress in a reversal of historical norms. Phew. That was a lot. Ive doubtlessly missed a good number of significant actions and policies and I invite you, dear reader, to make note of any omissions that I should have included. Whether or not you consider any or some of these legacies as *positive* it should be obvious that the PPACA, however prominently it figures in this administration, is not the only legacy of this POTUS. **Edited for formatting.** **Addition, with gratitude to /u/TheVegetaMonologues** **Addition, with gratitude to /u/Boye** **Addition, with gratitude to /u/qwicksilfer** **Also, /u/demonshalo thinks that I should fuck myself with crooked stick and has his own list.

My understanding is that the provisions of the NDAA that drew civil rights concerns are redundant to parts of the USA PATRIOT act so again its really not a legacy item. Even if it didnt, why doesnt all that get covered by my bullet about normalizing the Bush Doctrine. In fact, many more of your points are simply consequences of POTUS Obama having adopted the Bush Doctrine. * Renewing FISA and NSA?s unregulated spying and banking of all wireless communication * Granting the FBI access to private electronic communication without warrant * Quadrupling the numbers of warrantless wiretapping since Bush era (thats just a consequence of adding capacity) * Says it?s legal to track individuals by pinpointing their cellphone without warrant * Protects Bush?s war crimes as State Secrets (State Secrets doctrine is old hat.) * Grants immunity to CIA torturers * Continues to approve drone strikes that kill thousands of innocent civilians including women and children in Pakistan, Yemen, and other countries that do not want the US intervening (I had a whole other bullet point about this as well.) * Obama uses his Presidential Drone ?Kill List? to kill American cleric without trial (Again I refer you to my bullet point on drones) So if you could explain to me how all of this doesnt simply fall under the legacy item &gt;POTUS Obama adopted and normalized facets of the BUSH DOCTRINE Then Ill add edits. Still more of your items are facets of the administration of AG Holder &gt;The POTUS appointed the first African-American man, ERIC HOLDER, to the office of US ATTORNEY GENERAL. (**The impact of that administration on the legacy of POTUS is multifaceted and I will not offer an analysis of the same on that basis.**) * Engaging in a war on whistleblowers * Continuing military tribunals he vowed to end * Bringing no charges against bank executives that misused bailouts * Protects AG Holder from Congressional ?Fast and Furious? gun walking investigations (Executive privilege is also old hat.) * Deported more immigrants than any other president * Engaging in a war on whistle-blowers Other items on your list arent news. &gt;Defends raids on Amish raw milk farmers In the US all milk is required to be pasteurized (raw milk production is illegal and considered a threat to public health under the law.) &gt;Increasing Drug War budget &gt;Continuing prohibition and Federal attacks on legal marijuana dispensaries (they arent legal, marijuana is still illegal under federal law.) All departments have their budgets expanded from time to time. The bigger story is the expansion of drug prosecution under AG Holder (which is covered by my bullet point about him.) "
This guy. I really hope you get paid to think about all of this.

Yeah but ask the average person what Obama did for unmaned vehicles in combat or who he appointed to the Supreme Court and youll get blank stares. Obama killed bin Laden and implemented Obamacare. Thats his legacy.

Yet I dont recall him complaining when the operation to get Osama concluded during his time in office and everyone loved him.. Just a thought. Anyway."

POTUS Nixon is best remembered for the Watergate Scandal but was also instrumental in the opening of China, and he started the EPA. &gt;Is a legacy just the most identifiable thing on an influential mans list, or the sum of everything he did? From where I sit, legacy means the events actions and policies of an administration which have a lasting impact. There is a difference between a policy being the most visible legacy item and a policy being the totality of some legacy."

Thank you for making note of this omission. I am presently editing my post to include the CARD act.
"&gt; THE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP Hey there, Im Canadian. There is a huge uproar up here over the TPP. Parts of it have leaked and it doesnt look very good for the future of the internet. What do you guys down south think about it? We think our PM is an idiot for wanting to sign this thing."
"This is basically just a war of definitions. Every President does historic things like this list. The PPACA, on the other hand, will be the single most identifiable policy of Obamas career, and will have more visibility, on average, to American lives than the other (historic) things. Obviously, some policies will be more important to some people. Is a legacy just the most identifiable thing on an influential mans list, or the sum of everything he did?"
Sorry but his legacy is being the first black president. That is what the first line will say in every history book. 
"&gt;As a Canadian, I have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. If you ask specific questions I will be happy to try to help you understand anything that was unclear. &gt;Why doesnt the USA have socialized health care to take care of its own citizens when even 3rd world countries have better health care than you? Is this a question about Obamacare (PPACA)? Although there are subsidies involved and the medicare/aid rolls are set to expand, the PPACA does not set up what we generally are talking about when we say socialized healthcare outside of the US (single payer.) If you could clarify your question further I will be happy to try to help. To the spirit of your question: why dont we do those things that we ought to do? Well, we cant pass a fucking farm bill [(link)](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/306981-farm-bill-setback-opens-gop-to-attacks-about-ability-to-lead) so...the notion that we would pass major reform bills in practically any area of policy is currently untenable. [Here](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-04-30/entertainment/35451131_1_parliamentary-party-extremism-republicans) is a digest of a book from 12 that I found interesting (the digest is in review format.) I will not, at this time, recommend that book as it is out of date and expresses political views that I have not decided whether or not to publicly associate myself with."
"&gt;While the PPACA (aka Obamacare) is certainly the Presidents landmark signature legislative achievement, there is much more to his legacy. First paragraph, second line. Didnt forget it dude."
Thank you for reminding me why I support President Obama.
"&gt;Yet sadly, because Omabacare has such a nice ring to it, thats all anyone will remember. I am not so cynical as you. I would like to think that people in the US still seek to educate themselves about matters of importance to the civic discourse and to thereby discharge their own civic duties to the best of their ability."
"I think were using vastly different ideas/definitions of legacy. To me, legacy is not merely what the least interested observer will bother to remember about you."
"In other words, hes a really, really shitty Bill Clinton."
"What about cutting out private banks from government-backed student loans. By removing the middleman (who was making money risk free) millions (bajillions?) of dollars were saved, and could be used for more student loans. "
"&gt;he meant that what reaganomics is to ronald reagan, obamacare is to barack obama Legacy isnt what people remember about you, its about the lasting impact that you leave behind. Just because people on medicare part D dont necessarily know that theyre benefiting from a legacy of the Bush Administration doesnt make it a falsehood to call Part D part of that legacy. So Obamacare is literally his legacy isnt, as far as I can tell, correct and I listed many more facets of his legacy in order to demonstrate that. As for what was intended as opposed to what was actually said, I cant do much about that unless I get a direct response."
One of my favorites is finally doing something about student loan debt. 
Holy shit I forgot he actually did stuff 
"This list is by no means a tally of points in the Presidents column. Whether or not the POTUS is blameworthy or praiseworthy for any given legacy item is for each person to decide. It is simply my contention that the post is a list of actions, events and policies which comprise the legacy of this administration. I strongly dissociate myself with implication of your comment (that the POTUS is motivated by racial animus.)"
Keystone XL is game over for climate change? What about the hundreds of new Chinese coal factories and power plants?
We must have different notions of what a legacy is. I do not consider the totality of what one is known for among the least interested observers to be a satisfactory measure of legacy.
"&gt; POTUS Obama posed the question of intervention in SYRIA to congress in a reversal of historical norms. Yes but he did this only when the decision to intervene was going against him. This was not an act of Presidential discretion but amounted to a President well out of his depth, incapable of making serious decisions trying to throw his fuck up to someone else to take care of. "
"&gt; You forgot failed to prosecute the perpetrators of the largest collapse of the financial system in our time. Matters involved with the prosecution of persons falls under the purview of the US AG: &gt;The POTUS appointed the first African-American man, ERIC HOLDER, to the office of US ATTORNEY GENERAL. (**The impact of that administration on the legacy of POTUS is multifaceted and I will not offer an analysis of the same on that basis.**) Note the bold print. &gt;Oversaw the extension of indefinite detention because having trials would be too expensive; If youre referring to GITMO there is a bullet point mentioning that. If youre referring to something else cite sources and Ill edit the post to address my omission. &gt;Failed to close gitmo, knowingly ordered the drone assassination of an American citizen and in the process also killed his teenage son- born in Colorado. Gitmo has its own bullet point and matters related to both drone policy and Al Awlaki were discussed in the speech at NDU, which I list in another bullet point about the expansion of drone policy. &gt;You forgot knowingly spied on pretty much all of our allies and then got caught, and reacted by trying to use international sabre rattling to get back the whistle blower. The unauthorized disclosures and the POTUS reaction appears in yet another bullet point. You forgot to read thoroughly."
Youre entitled to your opinion. I strongly disassociate myself with your comment.
"However you want to evaluate that facet of his legacy, the events to which you refer will be part of the legacy of this administration. "
"If youre choosing to appoint someone to a position because they are truly the best possible person for the position, I dont think you should get extra points for that person being some kind of minority. If youre choosing someone who is some kind of minority **because** that person is a minority but actually isnt the best person for the position, you should like totally lose points man."
And NDAA. He signed that one too.
"Yeah. Thats all well and good. But thats not what he is known for. The general public doesnt have that knowledge. Even more so that Obamacare has his name applied to it. So it, whether he likes it or not, is what his legacy entails. "
* POTUS THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE
"I didnt associate myself with Jim Hansens comments, I simply cited them. As such I feel no need to defend them. The reference was by way of providing context and substantiating the claim that Keystone XL is of great concern to environmentalist groups."
"Thats all well and good but honestly his legacy is that hes an African American. Obama will be remembered for the color of his skin, not for his policies or legislation. "
"&gt;Several of the points listed here are just continuing the policies of Bush. Does that really count as Obamas legacy? Yes. &gt;I suppose you could say that doing nothing is in itself a legacy, but that seems deceptive to me. How do you reach that conclusion? &gt;I think of a legacy as something he personally did that significantly altered the course of the government. Nero famously played the fiddle as Rome burned, a legacy of inaction which altered the course of government. If legacy were only embodied in affirmative action then what shall we call the consequences of inaction when it has lasting impact?"
"You forgot failed to prosecute the perpetrators of the largest collapse of the financial system in our time. Oversaw the extension of indefinite detention because having trials would be too expensive; the suspension of habeas corpus. Failed to close gitmo, knowingly ordered the drone assassination of an American citizen and in the process also killed his teenage son- born in Colorado. You forgot knowingly spied on pretty much all of our allies and then got caught, and reacted by trying to use international sabre rattling to get back the whistle blower."
"Several of the points listed here are just continuing the policies of Bush. Does that really count as Obamas legacy? 1. POTUS Obama has maintained the timeline established under the administration of POTUS GEORGE W. BUSH for the WITHDRAWAL OF US TROOPS FROM IRAQ(Changed nothing) 2. POTUS Obama has maintained operations at the GUANTANAMO BAY DETENTION CENTER, citing congressional obstruction.(Changed nothing) 3. Before the end of his term the POTUS will issue a decision on the completion of the transnational portion of the Keystone XL pipeline, a crucial matter to environmentalist groups (Jim Hanson has called the exploitation of the Alberta tar fields game over for global climate change.) (This hasnt even happened yet. It cant be a legacy until it is in the past) 4. POTUS Obama signed into law the DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, the legacy of which cannot be assessed in full until the process of rule-writing is completed. (Again, counting our chickens before they hatch) 4. POTUS Obama has overseen the declassification numerous documents related to FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT and related SIGINT programs in response to media reports and unauthorized disclosures. (This happens constantly. stuff gets declassified, especially once everyone knows about it. How is this a legacy?) 5. POTUS Obama adopted and normalized facets of the BUSH DOCTRINE, especially regarding preemptive war. Under the POTUS, this adapted doctrine has been referred to as the JUST WAR DOCTRINE. POTUS Obama spoke about the JUST WAR DOCTRINE in his remarks to the Nobel Prize Committee which you can read HERE[2] (Changed nothing) I suppose you could say that doing nothing is in itself a legacy, but that seems deceptive to me. I think of a legacy as something he personally did that significantly altered the course of the government."
POTUS stands for President of the United States (of America) and Barrack Obama is indeed the President in the US.

"Big secret: Actually, I think the GOPs elites actually love Obamacare but they arent about to tell us why because then we would really be mad at them.

Not relevant: That fact check is completely irrelevant to the point I am trying to make.
***The agreements are multilateral which means that they are also increasing prices for poor Americans here.*** As a side effect.
"Im noticing all of OPs sources are from citizen.org. This is either a subtle plug for the site, or a weak argument because OPs not gone beyond their one source to double check the conclusions drawn by citizen.org. As others have said, theres no debate here, just a Bare Assertion fallacy to draw responses. To the topic: Your assertion that theres an ulterior motive is based on no specific actions actually taken. It is based on presumptions and definitely powered by a distrust of government officials in general. For example, quoting you: he seems to have allied his administration with the GOP and is trying to mount a stealth campaign to have power given to him to approve trade negotiations against the nations interests in secret. Obama aligns with the GOP to gain authority to go against the nations interests? Ridiculous. This isnt in the purview of the presidents role. They are handled by the Office of The United States Trade Representative. Also, considering we live in a world of multinational corporations, theres absolutely no controversy, since they stand to profit from each countrys marketplace in their own separate legal context. The United States only regulates what is sold based on FDA recommendations. Whatever drugs arent made here initially can be manufactured here once the drug in question is approved for sale. (This opens to a whole other discussion on international copyright and patent law) On March 4, a coalition of groups concerned about the anti-democratic investor-state provisions called for a public consulation because investor-state clauses in trade agreements threaten democratic principles and the national interest. Again, this is just not the way government interfaces with concerned parties. As with any court case, you have to prove actual damage done. The assertion of democratic principles being threatened is too vague to merit any attention from anyone. Public consultation? What does that even mean? Id also argue that trade relations are always in flux. Investor-state provisions merely enable companies to properly arbitrate issues that may arise with a foreign government. It gives them agency in court with government support, so that they can successfully navigate the legal system abroad. If youd rather not give pharma companies that kind of support (which is also given to foreign companies trying to settle disputes with the U.S. government), I guess you dont want that sort of stability and structure for when issues arise."
"http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/22avfp/why_is_the_obama_administration_trying_to_make/ Why is the Obama Administration trying to make drugs for sick people too expensive for them to afford, all around the world- while PRETENDING they want affordable health care? As I surf around the web at various web sites that deal with international trade issues and so called free trade agreements I am struck by the fact that the Obama Administration and the USTR (US Trade Representative) are playing hardball in at least a half dozen separate trade negotiations, trying to raise the prices of drugs such as to make drug companies maximum profits. These agreements all of which being bilateral or multilateral all apply to the US as well as to foreign nations. What they are doing is trying to block various measures which save countries prices on drugs. This has an unfortunate blow back effect on our own country. Let me give you some examples: ----------- https://www.citizen.org/documents/States-Letter-to-Kirk.pdf Here, representatives of numerous states complained of an ill conceived agenda to use trade policy to restrict foreign and domestic medicine pricing programs. ------ quote We call on you to renounce support for inclusion of a pharmaceutical pricing chapter in the TPP negotiations and prohibit any future use of trade agreements and pressures to push pharmaceutical pricing policies abroad that we do not follow here at home. As we have explained to you previously, U.S. federal government agencies and state governments negotiate drug prices in similar ways asforeign governments , and they pay similar prices. Some of the most important tools used by over 40 state Medicaid programs are open formularies known as Preferred Drug Lists (PDLs) . PDLs are substantially similar to the programs in other countries that USTR and industry criticize as unreasonable price controls. Two recent trade agreements, Australia and Korea, included pharmaceutical chapters that imposed restrictions on foreign programs . In each of these instances, state officials criticized the agreements as promoting new standards that, if applied to Medicaid and other state programs, would cripple our ability to control rapidly escalating medicine prices ------- See the problem? This policy has continued, as shown here. Now, having lost Democratic support for Fast Track Authority he seems to have allied his administration with the GOP and is trying to mount a stealth campaign to have power given to him to approve trade negotiations against the nations interests in secret. http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2014/01/obama-downplays-trade-authority-trans-pacific-partnership-fleeting-mention-doesnt-even-reference-rec.html On March 4, a coalition of groups concerned about the anti-democratic **investor-state** provisions called for a public consulation because investor-state clauses in trade agreements threaten democratic principles and the national interest. https://www.citizen.org/documents/letter_froman_public_consultation_investment.pdf See also: http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2013/11/38-million-retirees-say-no-to-a-trade-deal-that-would-make-medicine-more-expensive.html [Obamas Biggest Health Reform Blunder: How Big Pharmas Billy Tauzin conned the White House out of $76 billion](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/prescriptions/2009/08/obamas_biggest_health_reform_blunder.html). http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade http://www.citizen.org/investorcases .

"So, youre trying to 1. change the subject without addressing the main point which you know is trus.(because its been the subject of massive criticism of the US globally for quite some time) What else are you trying to do. Make a statement which is both untrue and irrelevant. Ignore the fact that probably 100,000 Americans are dying each year because they cant afford basic healthcare - a problem which is at least 50% the fault of the drug industry. Ignore the rampant corruption and the fact that the Obama regime is for sale but most Americans cant afford it, either. ignore the work of experts on the subject like this http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1261198/ did I miss anything?"
"Its not the job of the US government to save other countries money. Its job is to make sure our industries flourish. One of those industries is the pharmaceutical business. If a policy option arises where we can guarantee our American pharma companies make money then we should pursue it, regardless to what it might to do foreign interests. Other countries have their own governments to pursue their interests. We have our government to pursue our own. "

"I will hold my nose and vote for the Democrat in 2016, but, yes. I agree. Completely. Maybe Obama has valid secret information that would change my mind. But the information publicly available makes him look like an Argentine junta leader."
"&gt; How can Obama be worse on civil liberties when he is continuing programs that were conceptualized and had their birth during the Bush Administration? By increasing the authority those Bush programs had, and starting new ones that Bush never had. Drone bombings have increased, indefinite detention of American citizens without a trial is now signed into law, and the powers under the Patriot act were not only renewed but expanded upon. I hated Bush, but Obama is absolutely worse on civil liberties."

These affirmations were never included in anything Bush signed. &gt; Drone bombings have increased because the technology came into play towards the end of the Bush Administration. What are you trying to prove? All I see is you defending Obama for increasing the death that Bush caused. All I see you doing is defending Obama for (at the very least) continuing all the civil liberty atrocities Bush started. Why? Why defend Obama? The bottom line is that Obama is at the very least just as bad as Bush, and in reality, worse than Bush ever was. You may debate the expansions or affirmations that Obama himself has signed, in order to prove that he isnt worse, but why? Just because you cant deal with the fact that Obama wasnt the savior you were looking for? Too many people have your mindset. Obama was your guy, and you cant deal with the fact that he is Bush.

"Regardless of what side of this argument you fall on, stating that a lack of reported cases of voter fraud equals a lack of voter fraud is a fallacy. This evidence is misleading and needs to be eliminated from this debate. "
"The voter ID crusade is total bullshit, a fact blindingly obvious to anyone who bothers to ask themselves one single question: What is more likely to be successfully used to swing an election?: **A)** A vast, organized, undetected conspiracy of thousands upon thousands of people casting multiple ballots by impersonating others at polling places **B)** A law, primarily supported by one political party, that just happens to disenfranchise a large swath of people who tend to vote against that political party If you chose B, congratulations, youre not an idiot! The white Christian base the Republicans rely on is aging and dying off. Gerrymandering to preserve their ability to win elections will only be effective for so long. Instead of changing with the times and being welcoming to the increasingly diverse electorate, the Republicans decided it would be easier to simply prevent the people they dont like from being able to vote. Theyre also considering trying to change how senators are chosen, and in some Republican-controlled states, how electoral votes are allocated-- because they believe these tactics will prolong their electoral power even while the number of people willing to vote for them continues to shrink."
Then why are the Democrats so freaked out about it?
"Oh, yeah? There is a lot of anecdotal evidence to the contrary. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/19/ohio-poll-worker-obama-supporter-investigated-for-potentially-voting-six-times/"
"&gt;If this were really about voter impersonation fraud, supporters of this legislation would be fine allowing voters who no longer drive to use their expired drivers licenses, recently returned veterans to use their expired military identification cards or students to use their student identification cards. The arguments against voter ID are foolish: If an expired drivers license is OK, it can be passed on to someone who is not the person issued the expired license. The real person needs the real license. Expired military identification cards have the same problem. No one needs an expired form of identification unless that expired identification can be used to vote. Student ID cards are not government issued and do not require the identity verification of government issued identification. If you are going to argue in defense of fraud, at least try not to appear so foolish."
What happened to the uproar about a national ID card years ago? Isnt this the same thing?
Sure it is a false crusade but trying to convince the right of that is just about as impossible as convincing the left that it is a false crusade for gun control. These are your rights people and its never a good idea sacrifice them for a false sense of fraud prevention or safety. 
"If voter fraud is imaginary, why would you be opposed to an Identification Law? After all, without ID you cant open a bank account, smoke, drink, cash a check, get a job, go to school or college, go to a doctor, drive a car, go to a strip club, go to a casino or get on an airplane. In order to participate in life in the United States these days, Government Issued Identification is required at every level of existence. Seems to me, the only thing these days that DOESNT require ID is voting in an election. Ponder the implications, unless you already know but refuse to admit it. "
"Hey now ... there was that one guy that one time who voted twice. Or maybe there were two, even. "
"The Ohio story was originally report by the local ABC affiliate, not FOX, if that eases lessens the conundrum."
Voter fraud is rampant and needs to be stopped.

voter nullification
Just another right-wing tactic for suppression of those voters not likely to vote for their candidates.
"Its funny how left-wingers think you shouldnt have to show ID to vote but ask them if you should have to show ID to buy a gun and youll get a whole different answer. If it wasnt for double standards, left-wingers wouldnt have any standards at all. "
"Just going to drop this here... A friend who lives in Philly is younger, a mother of 3, black and is on help from the state after her husband left for greener fields. She finds this outrage from the Democrat party, which she has always been a member of, too much. Everything she has to do, she needs an ID for.. maybe instead of insulting others for wanting that to apply to Voting also, the Democrats should explain to their own party members, why they find they are too stupid to have/get an ID, for as she says, I need one many times a week"
" It is a game, wagering that some will not be willing to jump through all the hoops. 1. Need a Birth Certificate - and if it is in another State then it is both time and money. 2. Need a photo ID - which is the next hoop - as one has to go to the DMV - which in TX can take up to 4 hours The same stupid question - why does a 5 year old need a Social Security Number...they arent working or paying taxes. Wingers will say that everyone need to be counted and yet then complain about the number of 5 year old that dont carry them AT ALL TIMES."

"Not really. It had an emphasis on Health Savings Accounts and catastrophic coverage plans (read as: virtually useless), as opposed to the minimum standards in MassCare/the ACA. Speaking of which, Romney really had very little to do with the plan in MA, apart from vetoing huge chunks of it (which were overriden)."
"Nah...but looking at major platform points he ran on and it looks pretty grim. From the internet to terror to things like drug policy, he hasnt accomplished much. The health care reform success looks like a joke and a failure. Sure...there are a few things he has done or accomplished, but nothing that will define his legacy beyond so much disappointment after such high hopes"
"I disagree. I would bet money that in the longterm he will be seen as a top 20 (possibly top 15) president. I would make a wager to that effect. And the major thing hes done is steer the ship of the nation out of a state of economic disaster. Unemployment continues to drop. Even the U6 numbers which include part-timers, people who are under-employed, and those who have given up looking. Heck, even the participation numbers are improving once you factor out retirees, those who went back to school, and those who became homemakers or stay at home parents.

"We have no one to compare this to since it just started under Obama, but the [Obamater](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/) seems to show hes doing pretty good."
"There are legitimate reasons to question the BLMs actions at the Bundy and other ranches, but I havent seen any of them mentioned in the conservative press, or by conservative ideologues. My guess is this because like all media outlets they want something sensational that will allow them to pain Harry Reid as a bad guy and the truth is a bit more nuanced, but no less disturbing. First off, Bundy didnt just decide to stop paying the grazing fees cuz feds. The BLM were restricting his water and grazing rights, and were using the fees to buy out other ranchers. He felt they shouldnt be doing this and so started paying the fees to the state- which had no idea what to do with them, so stopped accepting them. The ostensible reason for restricting his grazing rights was for the desert tortoise, an endangered species which lives in the area. All the pro-environmental news sources have been touting that the US government determined that cattle ranching is destructive of the tortoises habitat. However, some quick research on my part turned up the following paper from the USGS which states &gt;Grazing by livestock has been implicated as a factor in decreasing populations of desert tortoises ... The effects of grazing on desert tortoises, however, have not been studied in a quanti?tative or scientifically rigorous manner https://www.fort.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/products/publications/2722/2722.pdf In other words, theyre basically guessing at this. Theres another paper from the University of Arizona which concludes that cattle grazing actually helps the tortoise: https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/rangelands/article/viewFile/10776/10049 &gt;The historical record shows that: &gt;1. Desert tortoises have coexisted with cattle for 300 years in California and Mexico and at least 100 years elsewhere. &gt;2. The highest tortoise densities known occurred at a time when overgrazing by livestock was the severest ever known. &gt;3. The fewer the cattle on a range, the fewer the number of tortoises. On the other hand, there are certain human activities which absolutely have been determined to damage the tortoises habitat and kill tortoises, namely the construction of solar plants. From wikipedia: &gt; Concerns about the impacts of the Ivanpah Solar thermal project led the developers to hire some 100 biologists and spend US$22 million caring for the tortoises on or near the site during construction.[19][20] Despite this, in a 2011 Revised Biological Assessment for the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, the Bureau of Land Management anticipated the loss or significant degradation of 3,520 acres of tortoise habitat and the harm of 57?274 adult tortoises, 608 juveniles, and 236 eggs inside the work area, and 203 adult tortoises and 1,541 juvenile tortoises outside the work area. The BLM expects that most of the juvenile tortoises on the project will be killed.[21][22] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_tortoise This for the Ivanpah solar project, constructed from 2010-2014. There are a number of other solar projects in the area either prospective or under development, and keep in mind, in the desert 90 miles away might be next door. To that end, the BLM has created a set of Solar Exclusion Zones to compensate for solar development in the area: http://blmsolar.anl.gov/program/exclusion/ &gt;A page on the BLM website, since removed, listed the impacts of trespass cattle owned by Cliven Bundy ... Non-governmental organizations regional offsite-mitigation strategies are also delayed for the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoff The solar thing isnt the *only* complaint against Bundy by a long shot, but the BLM does have a history of harassing ranchers. From the court decision US v Hage: &gt; government officials ... entered into a literal, intentional conspiracy to deprive the Hages not only of their permits but also of their vested water rights. This behavior shocks the conscience of the Court and provides a sufficient basis for a finding of irreparable harm to support the injunction described at the end of this Order. http://www.r-calfusa.com/property_rights/130524FindingsOfFactAndConclusionsOfLaw.pdf So basically it looks like the BLM is taking land from ranchers and giving it to solar companies. Why? Maybe its just bureaucracy, but from taking a look at the dates of legal action against Bundy: 1993-Bundy stops paying fees to BLM 1998-US issues permanent injunction against bundy 2012-Legal action begins again. All the litigation against Bundy has happened under Democratic administrations. If I had to guess, Id say the party in charge of the executive is being friendly to an industry which has a history of donating heavily to the Democratic party. Most of these ranches arent large argibusinesses and wont wield a lot of political weight in Washington. The same cant be said for the solar firms."
"No, the Harry Reid thing has been debunked. This is something entirely different. Read what I wrote."
Wow- Im down to -6 and not a single person has responded to disagree with me. People usually love to yell about this topic.
the solar thing has been debunked: http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/nevada.asp 
"Dont complicate things here. When the drone strike takes out Bundy, we all have to be in agreement that he was a terrorist."
Shut up and let the unelected 35 year old former Reid Staffer sell BLM land to Reid Holdings LLC for amounts not recorded at the Clark County Assessors before someone gets hurt. 
"Sweet, thanks!"
"No, not sweet. That link is full of deliberate misinformation. What happened was that Ohio shortened the absentee voting period by three days for everyone BUT military, failed to offer any justification for exempting the military but no other groups. The lawsuit filed sought to extend the three days back to everyone, not just the military. &gt;Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from implementing or enforcing the HB 224 and SB 295 changes to Ohio Rev. Code ? 3509.03, **thereby restoring in-person absentee voting on the three days immediately preceding Election Day for all Ohio voters.** That was the goal, getting BACK the three days for everyone, NOT to get rid of it for the military. However, the reality of the situation is that the court case could have come down on the side, Ok no one gets those days. Which is the part of it that a bunch of disingenuous partisan hacks and crazy people took to further fuel the Both sides do it! narrative. http://www.snopes.com/politics/ballot/military.asp "
Im one of them. He is far from perfect. I think his failure to end the drug war is a serious mistake. And I think his decision to look forward instead of investigating the alleged crimes of the last administration bordered on criminal. However he has worked quite hard to restore some intelligent dialog and civility to politics. And turning the economy back around was some nice work too. And he has managed to get some fairly major legislation passed even with the obstruction of republican crazies in Congress.

Reddits just chock-full of self-styled libertarians and cynics who like to shit on our entire system of government. But, in reality, Obamas keeping things on a pretty even keel considering circumstances (the GOP House, geopolitical climate, tenuous world economic situation, etc.).

Id rather they didnt. But we can fix that pretty easily if we want to.

"&gt;Dr. BRENNER: The concerns we have are actually twofold. One is that there are actually a lot of people who go through airport security many times. One group, of course, is airline pilots, another group is frequent fliers. A typical commercial airline pilot in this country goes through security anywhere from 200 to 400 times a year. So that means that the very small risk from an individual scan is multiplied by that number 200 or 300 times for a pilot, or for a frequent flier, in fact. Theres certainly frequent fliers who go through the security that many times in a year. &gt;I certainly would. Its hard to know what the logic is. I mean, I think the logic must be that the TSA believes both of them are safe and so theyre using both of these devices. But there is certainly not conclusive evidence but convincing evidence that there will be some cancers induced some time in the future by these X-ray devices. http://www.npr.org/2010/11/19/131447056/are-airport-scanners-safe &gt;As a ProPublica/PBS NewsHour investigation detailed earlier this month, X-ray body scanners use ionizing radiation, a form of energy that has been shown to damage DNA and cause cancer. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/europe-bans-x-ray-body-scanners/"
Leading radiation experts agree that multiple low dosages are harmful and damage DNA. Going through and being bombarded by cosmic rays is unavoidable. These machines are avoidable.

What are you talking about? The employer mandate only applies to 3.6% of businesses. 
"Around 90 percent of firms with 50 or more employees offer health insurance today, and when you get up to 100 employees, coverage is essentially universal, Buchmueller said. So the mandate will be a binding constraint for a very small number of firms -- the small number of medium-sized firms (say 50 to 99 employees) that currently do not offer insurance and a few more in that size range that might be thinking of dropping coverage. Total number of workers is 78.5 million that fall into the category of businesses with 50+ employees. The total number of workers that fall outside that category is 143.4 million. The statistic of 72% of people that work for companies is pointless considering that self employment accounts for 112 million workers alone. Adding it all up, you have 35% of all employed individuals that could possibly be affected, but, as stated above, only 10% of those firms with 50 or more individuals do not offer coverage. I will give you the benefit of the doubt (because its talking about percentage of firms, and not percentage of employees) and say that 10% of all employees (not just firms) in this range dont have health care and would be subject to the employer mandate. So, youre looking at 7.8 million employees, roughly 4% of the working population. This is, indeed, making a mountain out of a mole hill. Stats here: http://www2.census.gov/econ/susb/data/2010/us_naicssector_small_emplsize_2010.xls"
Only 3.6% of businesses in the country have 50 or more employees. The employer mandate only applies to businesses with 50 or more employees. 
"[And about 72% of people who work for companies,](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/18/chris-van-hollen/van-hollen-says-employer-mandate-affects-5-busines/) on top of new healthcare coverage cost burdens."

Job creation only to suit their interests... if they have any. If not they arent interested in job creation obviously. Im sure if they could make their interests come true without the necessity to employ people they would go for it in a heartbeat regardless of the need to create jobs as jobs is not the goal here.. its money for big interests that is #1 and only real goal. Every other action they take is to destroy job and/or make the current ones worse than they already are. I cant say Obamas administration is faultless either in this regards. No one has done much or anything about the issues that are a part of the job crisis in the US.

"Creating debt out of nowhere for political gain is not fiscal sanity. It is a freedom-reducing power grab, plain and simple. If it were strictly about fiscal sanity, they would take paths that didnt put political gains first.

See Detroit as of 2010 to present day for the prime example of political power literally trumping fiscal sanity.

"Ok lets try this one again. HURR HURR.. its against our rights to be tested and illegally searched to receive benefits. Its my right to do illegal drugs all day and receive public assistance from the taxes paid by folks that in all likely-hood had to get drug tested to get that job to pay into the taxes so that benefits can be paid. THis is a different topic.. but Ive always felt that those who are without jobs and who are receiving public benefits (barring those with kids that need to be taken care of or disabilities) should be providing community service.. Working in soup kitchens, Helping keep the parks clean etc.. do something, gain skills etc to end the assistance, or at least benefit the community thats helping you. edit: feel free to downvote this opposing opinion into oblivion."

Your failure to engage reality based on outrageous stereotyping is showing. 
Where am I stereotyping? Im not saying that all people on welfare/public assistance are running around doing drugs. I live in an area thats not financially well off.. and there are folks that Ive heard at the gas station: Ok Ill stop at the store and get you some creamer but I need to use my food stamps because I just spent all my cash on lotto tickets on the flip side of that Ive seen folks who receive benefits who are responsible and reasonable with them. And whats wrong with asking folks who are receiving public assistance to assist the public where they can? 
"Fantastic? Thats not the word I would use. Necessary comes closer to it. Id rather have just one good one, but good jobs are scarce and I dont have any valuable skills outside of interpersonal communication and charm. Id like to go back to college, but thats just not economically feasible; and Im getting old. So, I do what I can. "

"&gt; This is what I dont understand, maybe you can help me out. trickle-down economics has been in play since reagan. the concept, as it was sold to the general public, was that cutting taxes for the richest people would result in them having more disposable income, which would entice them to spend more, thus stimulating the economy more than what the lower or middle class could do. it was coupled with a change in the laws of incorporation that basically said corporations must be profitable and pay increasing dividends to their shareholders. thats when we started hearing the phrase weve got to answer to the shareholders/keep the shareholders happy. so the rich invested their money but did so not because the company was solid and good, but because the money they invested grew faster and paid out more. the additional money that was supposed to trickle down in the form of lower prices and increased wages never came, because it was all staying at the top of the cycle, circling around within investments and profit and dividends. add to it the fact that the concept itself is ridiculous. one wealthy family is not going to demonstrate the same buying power as 100 middle class families because theyre just not going to be able to consume as much. even if they did, that family wouldnt be wealthy for very long. yet the public bought it because they framed the idea within their own experience. the lower and middle classes spend a much larger percentage of each paycheck, so the logic is that the wealthy do too... but they dont. so trickle-down simply doesnt work. flood-UP works."

Also its better to say on both sides see the same facts and draw different conclusions. "
"&gt; The Tea Party especially is well educated and well informed Wow, just Wow. "
I think it begs the question what are they educated in if you want to call them educated. The same with being informed. But I dont think education or information has much to do with anyones ideology.

"You linked to a fact check of a statement I didnt make. Nice way to try and slip one by those not paying attention. I never claimed that: &gt;The U.S. spends more than all other countries combined on defense I claimed that: &gt;We spend more then the next top 9 nations do on military spending -combined-! Which we do! That can be verified by simply looking at the Wikipedia estimates you provided! For the sake of convenience Ill even concede that obvious point, and take your statement at face value then . Lets assume that the United States only spends about 37% of all money spent on defense worldwide as you claim. Thats still a ridiculous amount of money to spend on defense; with much of it being wasteful. Its certainly more money then we need to spend in order to just keep our citizens and country safe. Id rather get that money back in tax cuts, or useful social services; then have it go into the pockets of defense contractors. "
We spend more then the next top 9 nations do on military spending -combined-! We currently account for around 60% of total defense spending. The problem isnt a lack of funds. The problem is congress and the military leadership at the top are pissing money away; instead of spending it where it needs to be spent.
"&gt;We currently account for around 60% of total defense spending [Completely false](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/13/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-us-spends-more-all-othre-countri/). That was from 2011, and since then US military spending has decreased, while world military spending has increased. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures) estimates (admittedly a much less reliable source, but see the above) that the US spends about 37%. Hell, even without sources, your statement is just mathematically wrong. If you spend over 50% of the worlds total, then you automatically spend more than the entire rest of the world combined, not just 9 of about 200* countries. *number varies based on exactly whether a country is recognized, I think the low end is 195, as recognized by the UN, and the high end is 206, which includes 16 countries whose sovereignty is disputed."
The same can be said about the Democrats. 
"On the bright side, the reason the Rs are so fucking adamant about everything is because the party is dying. They are in a grab-and-run situation right now and theyre fighting it out to the bitter end. The mega-rich will always support them but the super-poor, racist white trash, oh, and baby-boomers too, are a dying breed. Most of the folks I know who were super racist ten years ago now have bi-racial grand kids. Theyre still racist...but wavering. This country is progressive as fuck. Its only a matter of time before the old racist, sexist and classist beliefs are sent to the grave with their last hold out believers. God Bless America!"
The funniest thing about this nightmare is that the GOP leadership is only doing this because all of them are getting primary challenged. So shut it down. The Republican Party has put this country through a total clusterfuck for four years and the bill has come due.
...is to destroy the economy.
No harm in trying to further the truth

Which is why they bought the congress. They will keep coming back, year after year, administration after administration, because the financial incentive is always there."
"Awww, thats cute, Obamas shills trying to defend their Furhers horrible Presidency by deflection. Were not horrible, DAE how bad Republicans are? Nobodys buying it. Impeach this criminal of a President."
"The sad thing is that most people without even realizing it admit that the government is destroying the economy, yet cry out to the government to fix it."
This is what you get with nationwide gerrymandering...
Every Business in the United States has a budget every household in the United States has a budget and most of them have debt too. I expect the congress to work together compromise and create a reasonable budget that keeps things running and pays down the debit. I want congress to behave like grownups and do their job. This sort of scorched earth politics is bad for our country and makes us appear even more incompetent then we already do to the rest of the world. The Affordable Care Act is going into effect get over it.
People in charge of running our government are incapable of doing so....enough of this.
"Yeah, its tough to ask for things the other side just cant give. Asking Obama to gut or cancel the Affordable Care Act is one of those... its like his major accomplishment hes not going to back down on that. It really gets me that we have to get to these crisis points to ever get any movement... and of course these things are carefully reasoned out and written when theres a time crunch."
"Sensationalist headlines like this really polarize the issue. This is whats wrong with US politics. There can never be a level headed discussion about anything. Lets play devils advocate for a moment: **Suspend the debt limit until December 2014.** Conceptually, this is to allow enough time so they can build a better budget (one that will last for more than 12 months) **Delay Obamacare for a year.** OK, so I work in a small privately owned manufacturing business with about 500 employees and the affordable care act is going to cost us about $500,000-1M in FY2014 year because if you want to change your insurance policy at all you lose your grandfather status. Thats a huge monetary loss in a recovering economy. Its easy support the ACA until you realize it costs small/medium size businesses the ability to retain about 20 jobs each, those jobs have been removed from the economy, and those people HAD healthcare, a living wage, and disposable income. **Include tax reform measures along the lines of the Rep. Paul Ryan principles.** This is probably a bad idea, and I say probably because last time I checked there were no clearly outlines principles. Everyone claimed his budget didnt balance, so Im against it. **Agree to a slew of environmental issues: Approve the Keystone pipeline, kill EPA clean air and climate regulations, increase drilling.** I get that some hardliners dont like the Keystone pipeline, but its a pretty decent way to fight back against OPEC and ensure that the US Dollar continues to be the basis for global trade in an energy based economy. Furthermore, cheap energy means that our economy can recover faster, because people can afford gas, electricity, and the cost of production of almost everything will fall. Also, a lot of those EPA regulations probably dont do what you think they do (e.g., most natural gas companies are exempt to those regulations, gulf oil spills still happen, Oklahoma doesnt have vehicle inspections, etc.) **Approve regulatory reforms including the REINS Act, which would basically gut the executive authority to make any regulations.** Constitutionally, the executive branch doesnt have any authority to legislate (regulate, make laws, whatever you want to call it), so Im actually for this. If you want the executive branch to have the power to legislate, then you probably need to amend the constitution. **Implement spending cuts, including reforming retirement programs, the child tax credit (to prevent fraud), and, of course, ending Dodd-Frank. Reforming health spending, including tort reform.** We need to reform health spending. We spend more than any other post-industrial nation, right? Spending cuts are good. Have you seen the national debt? Retirement programs *may* need to be reformed. The child tax credit *may* need to be reformed. I dont know anything about the last two, so I wont comment. ________ Anyway, these issues need to be discussed in a public forum. They dont need to be preached, regurgitated, reduced to Orwellian sound bites, then circle jerked about. The Democratic party is not divine, and the Republican party is not evil. At the end of the day, they are just people, from opposite sides of the isle, trying to represent their constituency democratically. The extremist, vocal minority in each party always seems to rise to a position of leadership, which prevents any centrist cooperation from taking place in Congress. And, truth be had, articles like this only make the polarization worse by driving the constituency apart. &lt;/rant&gt; "

great article!
"Its all a big bluff. Republicans cant risk a shutdown. Heres why. Right now they are framing the shutdown as a way to defund the ACA and stop Obamacare. Well, they cant stop the ACA. No matter what they do, on Oct 1, the ACA will go into effect, with or without the Federal Government being open. The exchanges are largely being managed by the states which will be open and will enact the ACA. Republicans cant go through all of this bluster about shutting down the gov to stop Obamacare, only to have the shutdown happen but the exchanges remain open. It will show that they did all of this for nothing and even their most staunch supporters will have to look at what they are doing and wonder whats going on in their heads. I predict that they will keep up the show until the last minute, then cave."
GOP start killing people otherwise you wont be taken seriously. 
At this point what I want to know is: What is a Republican today and are these public service workers actually Republican.
"Maybe we ought to give the Republicans what they want, along the lines of being careful what you wish for. Lets shut the government down, but really shut it down. Anyone who receives a federal paycheck gets furloughed. Federal agencies shut down. The federal courts shut down. Federal law enforcement shuts down. The military shuts down. Everything and everyone that depends on a check from Treasury shuts down. And then see how long it takes to adopt a budget and how long it takes to allow borrowing to meet the costs of laws passed by Congress. An hour? Ten minutes?"
Whats destroying the economy is the endless borrowing of money.
"I also chuckle when I hear conservatives compare the US budget to a household budget. If a family has to balance their budget so should the US government. I always turn that around in my head and apply the GOP standard to a household- if a household is over budget the earners of the family dont cut their working hours (income). But that is the only GOP solution to anything: tax cuts. Nor does a family decide that they are going to stop feeding one of their kids to save money (spending cuts). They get off their butts and work harder (tax increase) and try to buy more with less (increase efficiency). I am really disappointed in how lousy the Democrats are but I cannot, and never will, support a Republican candidate. They have destroyed their brand in my book."

Well the economy is already fucked for us peons. Lets let them destroy it and see how they like actually having to experience some of the effects of this bullshit.
"Whoever wins, we lose. If they refuse to increase the debt ceiling, the economy will lose. If we give them what they want, the economy loses. Seriously, its starting to look like violent means may be necessary to bring about a non-corrupt government."

"_Suspend the debt limit until December 2014._ Hold Congress accountable to the out of control spending on BOTH sides of the aisle. Our debt is already unrecoverable, so Dems think its time to just set the barn on fire. _Delay Obamacare for a year._ Cuts costs, saves a disastrous piece of bureaucratic, nightmarish leglisation that will single-handedly cripple our economy. Something so bad our quantitative easing and corrupt Federal Reserve cant save. _Include tax reform measures along the lines of the Rep. Paul Ryan principles._ Im all for reducing taxes, it just means the government cant draw more money from the people for their constant waste and fraud. _Agree to a slew of environmental issues: Approve the Keystone pipeline, kill EPA clean air and climate regulations, increase drilling._ Nobody wants a dirty environment, but nobody wants to see China take the oil that Canada has offered us. Its a missed opportunity, sorry tree huggers. _Approve regulatory reforms including the REINS Act, which would basically gut the executive authority to make any regulations._ Good, so the Commander and King cannot just continuously override Congress. _Implement spending cuts, including reforming retirement programs, the child tax credit (to prevent fraud), and, of course, ending Dodd-Frank._ Spending cuts, yay. Reforming what retirement programs? Social security? Congress has screwed that one up incredible already. How about allowing people to keep more of their hard earned cash to retire how they see fit. "
How is not increasing the debt limit the same as destroying the economy?
This is a pretty good dog &amp; pony show to take your mind off the other UN treaty Ballless Kerry signed.

Ever thought that if your government is a large enough part of your economy that it can bring the whole thing down if it fails... that your government is too big?
Youre making a generalization. Stop.
"Because the Democrats did nothing to destroy the economy, right? Because the Democrats didnt control what happened in the government at all when GW was the president while they had practically complete control of congress, right?"
The Republicans have no desire or intention to destroy the economy. They are trying to preserve an economy. The Democrats insist that they will shut down the government if they do not get their way. 
"Go here and educate yourself: http://www.factcheck.org/2013/01/voting-conspiracies/ You are not in danger of being called a racist but of being called a fool for not understanding why poor black democrats didnt vote for Romney and Ryan. Have you looked at Paul Ryans budgets? Might as well call them Destroy All Social Safety Net Act. Some Philadelphia Districts Don?t Like Romney All told, this email purporting to show ?astounding? evidence of ?voter fraud? contains just a scant sliver of truth. The only correct claim is that some districts in Philadelphia recorded 100 percent of their votes for Obama ? a stat that isn?t ?a mathematical and statistical impossibility,? as the email claims, and isn?t all that surprising once the full context is known. Claim: In 59 voting districts in the Philadelphia region, Obama received 100% of the votes with not even a single vote recorded for Romney. (A mathematical and statistical impossibility). It?s not mathematically impossible. The 59 districts are in areas of the city that are mainly African American, as the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. And Obama received 93 percent of the black vote nationwide. In 2008, Obama received 100 percent of the vote in 57 districts in Philadelphia. So it was not that unusual that something similar happened this time around. In fact, Inquirer reporters had a tough time tracking down any registered Republicans in these areas. To be clear, these districts make up a small subset of all of Philadelphia. The 59 that went 100 percent for Obama in 2012 constitute 19,605 votes, just 3 percent of the total votes cast in the city. ? Lori Robertson, with Jesse DuBois"
Obama had 100% of the vote in some areas of the country. This was brushed under the carpet and anyone attempting to investigate it was called a racist
What does that have to do with this story?
"he lied to get it passed, you know that as well as i do. the point is not MOOT, if He states that : YOU CAN KEEP YOU PLAN IF YOU LIKE IT.. in other words its like a grandfathered plan. just like your phone bill at ATT, they dont offer unlimited anymore but if you had it before u can keep it so long as you dont change anything. but hey because most people are ignorant idiots they fell for this BS lie, and now 2.5 million people lost their insurance that they wanted to keep. "

"&gt; I havent seen a report of widespread premium increases based on actual numbers, but with any system overhaul as large as this, there are bound to be outliers. There are 2 groups that experience policy price increase: - Those [Earning over ~$100K/year](https://www.healthcare.gov/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums/) in household income, - Those that are in the [states that chose not to expand medicaid](https://www.healthcare.gov/what-if-my-state-is-not-expanding-medicaid/) ([qualifying you for harship exemtions](https://www.healthcare.gov/exemptions/))."
&gt;the cancelled policies were cancelled because ACA made them illegal. Nope. Any policy in existence at the time that Affordable Care was passed was allowed to continue and grandfathered in. But previously individual insurance was not real insurance anyway. In the pre ACA days insurance companies were merely selling a false sense of security.
.
.
"&gt;&gt;People losing hours is not an effect of ACA... Not true. The ACA says employers must offer health insurance coverage to their full-time employees and their eligible dependents or face a penalty. Because of this, some employers (AKA greater than one) are using this as an excuse to reduce employees hours to avoid this. It doesnt matter if its justified or not, it is still the ACAs fault to some extent. &gt;&gt;...the cancelled policies were cancelled because ACA made them illegal Pretty much, yes. &gt;&gt;pretty safe to assume that a policy made illegal by new legislation would be altered or cancelled Except this was the opposite of what he was implying, and even stating. He said that if you like your health care plan, youll be able to keep your health care plan. And this is completely not true. The implication was that old plans would not be touched; they would be grandfathered in. And it was set up to allow plans to be grandfathered in, which meant Even though these plans are illegal, you can keep them. However, this did not work out, as some of the restrictions to be grandfathered in were too strict. However, the insurance companies deserve blame here as well as the ACA. &gt;&gt;I havent seen a report of widespread premium increases based on actual numbers After looking it up, I will agree that this research is lacking. Here is politifacts take on it: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/17/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-premiums-have-gone-virtually-eve/ &gt;&gt;the website launch was a complete disaster Yeah. Cronyism or not, I cant imagine anyone making a site that bad."
"Yeah, Im pretty sure that more than 1% of people get health care from work. Cause I do, and so does pretty match everyone I know. So unless were the only ones...."
I guess its more like 5%. Its not like every company doesnt provide insurance. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/18/chris-van-hollen/van-hollen-says-employer-mandate-affects-5-busines/

Im guessing itll be at least 20 years before we repair most of the damage that Bush and the congressional Republicans did while they were in power. 
Republicans controlled the WH and Congress for 8 years and the damage will certainly not be repaired in our lifetimes. So lets not do that one. 
"From snopes: First of all, the number of executive orders issued by President Obama is grossly exaggerated here. Through the first five years of his presidency (i.e., as of 20 January 2014) the count of all executive orders issued by President Obama was 168, not 923. Moreover, compared to President Obamas predecessors in the White House, this is not an unusually large number of orders for a modern president: President George W. Bush issued 291 executive orders during his eight years in office, while President Bill Clinton issued 364 such orders over the same span of time. Read more at http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/executiveorders.asp#R4qDb9qEo2i4SUj0.99"
"Why dont you go actually learn about what an [executive order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) is -- what it can apply to, how long it lasts, what happens when a new president is in office -- and get back to me."
"Obama campaigned on fighting a war, talking about how his beliefs aligned with Ronald Reagan, and other moderate or conservative ideas including expanding the insurance market to benefit corporations instead of a single payer government run health care system. Also if you look at his campaign promises he has followed through or compromised with over 70% http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/ So what clothing did you think he was wearing?"
I am liberal and hate Obama because he is a wolf in sheeps clothing.

"Its awesome, seeing so many people on here parroting Harry Reids propaganda. Theyre claiming [falsely] that Bundy owed $1 million. (It was actually something like $200,000.) And theyre ignoring Harry Reids part in the scam to make money selling the land to a Chinese energy concern [using his son as a middle man]. In other words, theyre clearing the land [via eminent domain] to sell it to a private corporation . . . which is Constitutionally illegal. But no one is pointing out Harry Reids un-Constitutional behavior and his corruption, and, rather, theyre concentrating on Bundy (who is irrelevant to the larger narrative). To see a breakdown of whats *really* happening, see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=964TobTvPW0 * Moral of the story: Dont repeat talking points from MSNBC or CNN on this issue. Theyre carrying water for corrupt policies and shifting the focus away from the actual issues involved."
Nice going showing you really believed the Chinese sale bullshit 
"ehhh,, interest and penalties.... that $200k is easily $1m now ... and that probably is an under-guess."
"Its documented. I believe in documentation. Why was evidence of it scrubbed from Reids own website? Go back to the link I provided.

"Youre the second person who cited Snopes. As if Snopes trustworthiness were unassailable. Its not. For those unaware of the many times Snopes has been busted, go Google Snopes embarrassment when they attempted to discredit director Michael Moore. Moore alleged that the Bin Laden family was flown out of the US during an airspace shutdown following the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Snopes claimed to have debunked him. And they used government propaganda to do so. It later came out that Snopes had relied on disinformation, and that Moore was absolutely 100% correct. Snopes hitpiece was entitled Flight of Fancy, and they went out of their way to be snide and condescending in debunking Moore. Turns out: Oops. Moore was right and Snopes was wrong. Google it. Snopes has been busted time and time again getting their facts wrong. Remember: Its just a husband and wife team with no investigative credentials whatsoever. Theyre not former cops, former private-eyes, or [unlike Moore] former investigative journalists. Just two amateurs who admit that their biggest tool is the internet. Because of their lack of sophistication or credentials, theyve relied heavily on government propaganda and disinformation in the past--and been busted for being wrong. So dont trot out Snopes as your checkmate. Snopes said it. So its 100% true! * Footnote: Check out other articles where Snopes has been debunked . . . like in their coverage of Elena Kagan and her role in the Obama birther controversy.

Soros doesnt own/manage a TV network. He just donates to candidates. I see a big difference.
"In an interview with The Washington Post on November 11, 2003, Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the central focus of my life and a matter of life and death. He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush if someone guaranteed it.[55] [56] Soros gave $3 million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5 million to MoveOn.org, and $20 million[57] to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multi-state tour with a speech: Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush[58] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, DC. The online transcript to this speech received many hits after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as factcheck.com in the Vice Presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros site.[59] When Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in The Age of Fallibility that the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States, he responded that it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world. And I think thats rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda. By declaring a war on terror after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world. ... when you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims.[60] Soros was not a large donor to US political causes until the 2004 presidential election, but according to the Center for Responsive Politics, during the 2003?2004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various 527 groups dedicated to defeating President Bush. A 527 group is a type of American tax-exempt organization named after a section of the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. ? 527. After Bushs re-election, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called Democracy Alliance, which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.[61]"
"Why would he have to lying? His conference was before all the juicy stuff! Now we know it WASNT only conservative groups, just more of them (because there were more applying for exempt status) that were being looked at. Dont worry little friend, the American people will root out those dark money donors one day soon. "
"&gt; Unless you are suggesting he was lying. You really think someone would do that, just **lie** for political expedience?

I like your optimism although I fear it isnt based in reality.
Obama apologizes when somebody sneezes. And that is coming from a Canadian.
"Well it was prfiling as well and if he appears to be siding with the IRS profiling his opponents its not going to play well. What they did was wrong, but the conservative reaction may be partially about protecting these groups from scrutiny. Notice the focus isnt on these groups getting tax emempt status anymore."
"But when he was campaigning Obama said that such intrusions were unconstitutional and would not happen were he elected President ... oh, never mind."
"No he made no such promises. In fact, he voted for FISA before he became president. As did most elected representatives other than a small vocal minority who isnt aware that FISA was created in response to prevent Nixon wiretaps."

This characterization is just painfully simplistic and exaggerated. [Here is Politifacts detailed description](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/jun/13/barack-obama-surveillance-then-and-now/) 
"Except you can keep your doctor. Theres lots to dislike about Obama, from his support of Bush era torturers, to his war on whistleblowers, to his vile drone policy, etc. But people do get to keep their doctors under Obamacare. Claiming otherwise is a lie."
"[Yep, nothing but lies.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-kept/)"
"Obama would never let the FCC do this. Hes going to keep his pledge on that like he did on you keeping your doctor ... oh, never mind. One word to describe Obama ... liar."
lol...sure....http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-kept/
"He did lie about this and other things. Unfortunately, we dont get to choose between politicians who lie and ones who dont. So we chose Obama for lying less then the other guys."
Youd rather he forced doctors via law to not be able to drop clients for any reason? Socialist.
"OK? The individual mandate only affects 10 percent of the country. So using just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population doesnt help. EDIT: Dude, the article you referenced said most people who are on a individual healthcare plan already change there policy a lot. 4.8 percent change it before 44 months. So why would it matter that in seven years 100 percent of people who have INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE loose it, if everyone changes it before hand anyhow?"
"[Politifact:](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-under-his-health-care-law-those-/) &gt;As we have previously noted, many Americans already lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law. Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan. &gt;How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population switched health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching... So, lets say conservatively 15% a year? 100% lose their health insurance (using the GOP definition) every seven years. "
"Exactly. 4.8 percent of people in this type of insurance keep it longer than 44 months. That statement has nothing to do with the ACA. That was a fact before the ACA was implemented. And lets be real, how many people does this ACTUALLY affect? - Your second point. Is this necessarily a bad thing that my proverbial child can stay on my insurance longer? - Your third point. Like I said, they most likely knew what they were doing with the grandfather clause. But if you look at the original info, only 4.8 percent keep their plan longer then 44 anyhow. What difference does it make if you need to update it a few months ahead of that?"
Ummm...OK. And you have some sort of evidence for this or are you just trolling hard at this point.

This has been reported many places, but you can start here: http://www.factcheck.org/kerry_ad_falsely_accuses_cheney_on_halliburton.html"
"Dont even go there. Dick Cheney wanted the war in Iraq because of the enormous opportunities for Halliburton and various oil companies that he was heavily invested in. He lied to make it happen, cooked the intelligence, strong armed the CIA and the Pentagon.

Job creators is a cop out term for elite to get richer while keeping everyone else down. Dont believe me? Tell that to the 800k furloughed workers while congress still gets their $174k salaries 
"I can. Thats why every single one of them deserves to be thrown out on their ass in the midterm elections. To quote from a classic movie, Animal House, Dont get mad, get even...VOTE!!!!!"
No. I am referring strictly to the GOP and Tea Party. The Democrats policies do nothing but HELP the lower and middle class. 
"Dont forget the fiscally responsible Republicans are also wasting 150 million for every day the government is shutdown. Also the sequester also hurt the economy and the middle class all in the name of worthwhile cuts. It is estimated that the sequester will stop the possible creation of 750,000 jobs. With the sequester they change one thing to fix. [Flight delays](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/26/news/la-pn-congress-passes-faa-fix-20130426). Because it was the only thing in the sequester that affected them. No changes to the cancer treatment cuts, or research funding. And yet theyll still get elected, every year just to not work in the interests of their constituents."
I hope you mean these selfish pricks with BOTH parties.
I wish I could upvote you more. The hypocrisy is outstanding. The sad thing is I have to argue with people at work that this is insanity. The latest debate I brought up at work was investing in an HSA. All the right wing folks are screaming foul not to change their insurance. Then they scream that insurance needs to be destroyed because that is whats wrong with healthcare. Then they tout about personal responsibility. Its so strange how I advocate for an HSA and they completely contradict themselves arguing against it.
"In a private/public economy its the surplus of the private branch that funds the public branch, so when the GOP talk about being job creators its the private branch they are talking about."
"&gt;Meanwhile, the congressional reps **ARE** getting paid. They dont have a choice in this, the constitution says that pay for congressmen is set in stone until they are re-elected, so please stop bringing this up, Im sure many congressmen would stop their pay in this shutdown if they could they cant so why even discuss it."
"Well, according to the GOP, government jobs arent *real* jobs anyway. And those people definitely arent getting *real* paychecks that they use to buy *real* goods and services that helps drive the *real* economy either."
"I thought Republicans claimed to be job creators? Thats the whole reason they even took control over the House... and they just told 800,000 employees to stay home on unpaid leave of absence until further notice. Meanwhile, the congressional reps **ARE** getting paid. I cant believe the nerve of these selfish pricks. "
"Lol....800,000 jobs with tax payer money you do understand that money comes from taxes. Government doesnt produce or sell anything? If government could create jobs why doesnt the government triple its workforce then we could have a lot less unemployment? Why doesnt Obamas government mail out $5000 checks to everyone? Oh wait again that would be our money, unless they print the money then we are borrowing it from future generations and giving them more debt to bare. Obama is more like GW, Obama bailed out the banks, Obama is bailing out Detroit, but all on the backs of the people that try to take care of their shit. Leave the government shut down I could care less."
"Tea partiers stand on the grounds of reducing the debt, not creating jobs."
"After previous shutdowns, all workers received their back pay whether they were sent home or not. So furloughed workers are basically getting free vacation courtesy of the GOP. Hows that for waste?"
Its not unpaid. They get the back pay when they return. Its paid vacation with delayed payment. 
I should be a congressman.
The government employees will get back pay once this is resolved. We just loose the productivity generated by them being on the job...
And they have the BALLS to blame Obama. 
"The far right wingers, as you can see in the crazy right wing subs (like /r/Libertarian), often find taxes to be literally stealing. Its not hard to see how the crazies can develop an entire ideology from the mentality that they they owe nothing to the public (when publicly built roads, ports and other infrastructure, as well as centrally funded science, and countless other public things funded their success)"
It makes me sick that these men can throw a temper tantrum of epic proportions and get away with it.
No. I was just playing off Romneys I want to create jobs. repetitive bull. 
Did you ACTUALLY believe they are job creators? Capitalists are not job creators. 
U fucken. Leave. The job creators. Alone. Dey. Needz. Moar moneyz 
"Actually the reason they took over the House was because they gerrymandered the districts during the last census. 53% of the population voted for democratic politicians, but democrats make up only 47% of the House currently."
They arent selfish; they have the big guns; just try stop buying what they are selling and youll see.
"It really is embarrassing as a moderate conservative. Especially being from Texas. If these guys were looking for a way to guarantee a 2016 White House loss, they found it.

"&gt;These are predatory policies that have deductables that people cant even afford. I suppose youre sad to see slavery go because at least they had a roof over their heads. Most of these are also replaced with a new policy by the same company or allow people to get something better on the exchanges. What? Most we plans have a higher deductible, higher coinsurance, and higher copays. And if you dont qualify for a discount from the exchange, higher premiums. Its absolutely crushing individuals making $45k or families making $80k that need to purchase from the individual market. For minimum wage employees who get health insurance from their job will see their copay, coinsurance, etc go way up. "
"That article doesnt dispute anything I said what so ever. First its only talking about premiums (not copay, coinsurance, deductible) and the article itself confirms premiums have risen on average when it was sold to the public as something that would drastically lower them. And the age group seeing the most increases are the young people who are least likely to utilize the services."
"Your own link proves my point. Voter rolls may be obviously inaccurate, but TrueTheVote found only 99 cases of interstate ballot fraud? How many actual cases of real voter fraud? I just did a survey of some of the supposed 46 states that prosecuted ballot fraud and saw mixed results. In one case it was a candidate who was arrested for fraud because he was running in a district he didnt live in. Listening to republicans talk about the dangers of voter fraud you would think people are out there casting 2, 3 or 4 ballots per person. In truth it happens so rarely that you have to search pretty hard to find prosecutions for it."
"Poll taxes are illegal and obtaining a free photo ID in some areas is actually a convoluted process. Also, ballot fraud is a felony with almost no immediate and tangible benefit. Actual voter fraud is incredibly rare. Laws like these have nothing to do with real voter fraud. Theyre designed to prevent people from voting - nothing else. My wife and I got married a few months ago and she took my name. Whether her voter registration was updated with the new name or not doesnt give her any opportunity to vote twice. It just so happens the county updated her registration automatically when the marriage certificate was filed. Why doesnt Texas do that? Because Texas hates women voters. Apparently."
&gt;Poll taxes are illegal Most states that are thinking of requiring ID are also talking about providing it free to low income people who cant afford it. Maybe this is a reason why we need National ID. &gt;obtaining a free photo ID in some areas is actually a convoluted process ...but can be done. You just negated your own point. &gt; Actual voter fraud is incredibly rare. http://www.truethevote.org/news/how-widespread-is-voter-fraud-2012-facts-figures I dont *care* if you dont like the above source. &gt;Laws like these have nothing to do with real voter fraud.

No... they are designed to improve vote legitimacy. &gt;Why doesnt Texas do that? Because Texas hates women voters. Apparently. Texas is a solidly red state... you are claiming that they hate conservative women voters? It does not follow. Maybe their state regulations are structured in such a way that it requires the person to actually request a change. At any rate...not automatically updating is not a new thing. What people are objecting to here is voter ID... and a number of states have that and no one bitches about it.

"In a worst case scenario, shouldnt this have been found to be Half-True? PolitiFact showed that indeed millions of Americans are paying higher premiums. They attempt to spin this by claiming the rate of increase is lower, but thats not the same thing as paying lower premiums. They even summed it up by saying At worst, they?re paying more to get more. Ergo, an unbiased truth-seeking organization would have rated the statement to be Half-True."

But there are signs that the rate of the increase has declined since the law was passed. The rates were slowing long before Obama came into office. Starting in 2002 the rates were decreasing as well. &gt;The government attributed the decrease in health costs to the economic downturn. Kaiser, too, said the recession accounted for much of the decline, though they said the health care law may have played a role, too. Oh ok got it. So a decrease in the rates before Obama thats just white noise due to a flailing economy. But slowed rates after Obama...Now well that *must* be due to Obamacare. Thanks politifact, I love the objective viewpoint. Oh by the way, the year after Obamacare became a law was the single greatest increase in the last 6 years. But there is likely no correlation between those two factors, right?"

Not a republican or defending them? I disagree with them quite a bit on many points. Though I will add your statements sound a lot like propaganda in their own right.
"If you are pro-choice, you are just a tool of the Democratic party, because the Democrats just use abortion as a tool to win womens votes, and to add to another generation of minority and women voters. See, the cynicism can work both ways. Believe it or not, in the real world, some people are just against abortion because they believe it is murdering babies. "
"Youre a tool. SNAP has more than doubled in the past 5 years. Let it sink in. It did so partially because Obama got rid of the work rules that Clinton had put in place.

"Thats a crock of shit and you know it. The Republicans demanded amendment after amendment to the Affordable Healthcare Act, and are ultimately the reason the mandate was added, and in the end, only ONE Republican voted for it, a moderate in a heavily blue state."
"The democrats blocked the gun bill. There was an amendment offered for CCW reciprocity, if that amendment passed, the republicans would probably have voted for the final bill. "
Bingo. Democrats can piss and moan about how the bill was a compromise but it simply was not. Something for nothing is not a compromise.
" Even the people who supported it admitted it wouldnt do anything, so why bother? The answer is because the next time some tragedy happens (which it will, because the proposed bill will have no effect on crime) they can tighten the ratchet more. The entire point of the proposed bill is to chip away at our rights, nothing more. A lot of people have realized this, that is why it wont pass. It might be possible to shift priorities in a way that isnt a net loss of rights, but the democrats wont stand for that. Their goal is eliminating RKBA, a bill that merely addressed crime problems without removing rights doesnt help their agenda."
"Bull fucking shit. It is [clear as day](http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/05/01/background-checks-goper-reveals-why-the-gun-bill-failed/) why this bill didnt pass. This was supposed to be a [non-controversial](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/apr/30/summary-manchin-toomey-gun-proposal/) proposal that should have had bipartisan support. It had bipartisan support across the nation that it is quoted that 90% of people supported universal background checks. Even if this was inflated 150%, that is still 60% support, enough support that it should have reached the house floor. Taking away the right of a state to enforce their own gun laws regarding CCW?

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/20/iraq-war-oil-resources-energy-peak-scarcity-economy) is a recent article on this from The Guardian."
it goes beyond Halliburton
Criminal case anybody ?
But Clinton said Iraq had WMDs too. Was he in on it?
"See, Im with you fully on Dubya. Im just not sure about Cheney. You are right, hes a megalomaniac control freak. I just believe there was monetary incentive beyond just control freak-ery. Its too much of a coincidence to go from running Halliburton to suddenly giving them billions."
"I saw this article when it was first posted and my initial reaction was in other news, the titanic sank. "
"Just let that sink in for second. Our president and his adminstration told a flat out lie to throw our country into war. This war has led to the deaths of thousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands of non-Americans and left many more disabled and depressed to the point where many commit suicide. All in the name of profit. Then our next president tried to ignore it all and act like we should all move on. Now recently it has came out that the toture used during this years was much worse than any of us imagined and absolutely no one is going to be held accountable. We as a society have failed miserably. Its fucking disgusting."

"I think its profit-motivated. Im having trouble seeing Cheney as a starry-eyed idealist who just coincidentally went from running Halliburton to dumping the whole contents of the treasury on them. So, maybe you are right, maybe I am. Well never know for sure."
He sure is right when he says something that we all already know to be true!
"The Bush Administration knew there was a lack of evidence but thats different from them believing, understanding, or knowing there was a lack of evidence. Intelligence reports almost never land on someones desk cut and dry - its full of probables, likelihoods, and other words that are purposely unclear even behind the classified wall. What won out over this decades-long approach within intelligence was the political certainty within the White House that Iraq was a threat which needed to be handled. Thats what makes things far worse - its not that they knew they were lying, its that they truly believed in their heart of hearts that they were doing the right thing in a climate they saw clouded by ambiguous intelligence and chaotic geopolitics. Only Powell, White, and a few others even stopped to think and consider the possibility or option of **not** attacking but it was overruled by the certainty that this new military with massive contractor support could stop a bad man from doing a bad thing. They were at least partially right, but then we demand more out of our leaders."
"I believe they once existed but were moved out of the country before the war. However, I believe our intelligence knew this and went to war anyway. So, WMDs or not, they were gong to war."
"Fair enough, its clearly a war of profit for certain American leaders and the Bushs have plenty of oil pals. Its more or less the same thing but slightly different pile. Instead of Halliburton profiting, the Kochs or someone else equally awful will profit. Thousands of Americans and tens of thousands+ Iraqis are dead for the presidents/vps pals. "

Im not a fan of Rand but hes right this time. That was 100% the point of the Iraq war. Cheney/Dubya/Blair had already been informed by intelligence agencies that no WMDs existed.
No one should be a fan of Rand Paul because he says whatever is popular at the moment. Hes easily one of the fakest shits around with zero consistency on any level.
"Im a rabid liberal (at least now). But I dont think Bush did it for those reasons. I think Cheney saw an opportunity when he was asked to find someone to be his VP (Cheney ultimately picked himself). Rumsfeld and Rove both latched on as well. Because Bush was more charismatic than a garden snail (Turbo excluded) he was able to win over Gore. And by win I mean have things decided by the SCOTUS even though it is pretty much directly prohibited by the constitution AND there is reason to believe that there was voter fraud and other issues. But whatever, thats not my point. My point is - Bush got elected because he was who came out of the primaries. Cheney, Rumsfeld and Rove all latched onto him like diseased ticks. Ready to suck the motherfucker dry just to serve their own purpose. And they did just that. Now - Im not saying Bush didnt want to go into Iraq. He did. But for completely different reasons. And it was this particular issue that was the in for Cheney and Rumsfeld. Bush hated Saddam because Saddam tried to assassinate his father. During the exchange of office, Cheney allegedly requested a briefing on Iraq from the outgoing administration ([Source](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042700550.html)). It appeared that even before 9/11/2001 Bush had his sights set on Iraq. Or, at the very least, Cheney. Now heres where things get a little complicated. Bush ended up allying himself with people who felt that George H Bush should have gone in and overthrown Saddam during desert shield/storm. GHB knew then, and said since, that there was no clear exit strategy so he could not risk going in. He has since said that he did not agree with his sons actions. Rumsfeld and Cheney disagreed, but ultimately the first Bush knew better than to trust those guys. However, GWB wasnt as sharp. Perhaps it was because he was blinded by the assassination attempt of his father, or the way that the Clinton administration thought of Saddam (they both wanted Saddam out, but Clinton wasnt willing to go to war over it). Either way - Bush was easily convinced by Cheney and company to go into Iraq. Then 9/11 happened. This diverted their attention to afghanistan, because that was where everything pointed to. But even then, they started spinning lies about how there were terrorists who were linked to Iraq in on 9/11 (even though this has been found not to be the case). Cheney would go on to say things like that Iraq would have nuclear weapons within a year. Note, Cheney did this first. Others followed suit. Cheney, when looking back, seemed to have a stranglehold on the administration. He would do things without really clearing them because he had an authoritarian god complex going on. He seemed to think he knew how to protect everyone. Id even grant that he thought that he could kill two birds with one stone in Iraq. He could depose Saddam and since he knew best, obviously his company Halliburton would know how best to rebuild Iraq. Now, ultimately it is the presidents decision to go to war. But when youre constantly being fed lies by the people you trust the most, you dont go with your gut. Since his gut was that pig fucker over in Iraq tried to kill my dad he ended up siding with the war mongers. While he still is ultimately responsible, I dont think he did it with the intent for Cheney and others to profit off of. I think he was used to suit the goals of those who were doing the using, and this is even supported by evidence of a significant rift between Bush and Cheney both in the late part of his second term and since. So, while I think that Bush didnt do it maliciously, and Cheney had what he rationalized as the countrys best interest in mind, everything got skewed. But, Cheney, that man is downright evil. In my opinion, he beats Saddam on the scale of evil. Anyone who is willing to sell to an entire country a war they dont need because he knows best or wants to be the hero, then gets that wish, and lets it end up as a huge clusterfuck of dead soldiers and civilians (not to mention combatants who would likely never have turned to that life had we not invaded). He pretty much destroyed all of Iraq. At least Saddam only destroyed part of it. And Cheney had the added I fucked over the american people while doing it. And because I think it accurately sums him up: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQeEyFzKyLg "
I was with you up until greatest vp. Now Im 90% sure you are being sarcastic or a troll.
he is absolutely wrong. Rand Paul is a batshit crazy moron like his father and he has the balls to blatantly lie and insult one of our nations greatest VPs of all time? 
&gt;Im not a fan of Rand but hes right this time. My theory is that hes the one saying these things because it discredits the cause of accountability. Have a racist crackpot hijack the issue and it damages the credibility of the many non-idiots who also support it.
Dubya paints awful paintings now.. and somehow his daughter is on the today show
"Just to play devils advocate (because I agree with you pretty much all the way), they had been informed that the original intelligence suggesting Saddam had WMDs wasnt necessarily reliable, they had not been given any confirmation that the WMDs didnt exist. And to be fair, Saddam was known to have tried to obtain WMDs on a number of occasions. Still, as much as it was the right thing to do to remove Saddam and his heinous party from power in principle, the war was a giant sloppy mess really only intended to generate money/power for certain corporations and lobbies in the US and Europe."
"There are tons of articles on this, but Dubya/Blair were informed by intelligence agents that there were no WMDs. http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/04/23/cia.iraq/ Beyond that, yeah Saddam sucked, but lots of leaders are equally horrible or worse. Do we start invading every sovereign country that has a leader our leaders dont like?"
Source on other agents informing them? Source on Cheney not profiting? Provide a fact check link. The only thing I could find was this: http://www.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/they-lied-they-died.pdf 
1) Factcheck.org already debunked this countless times. There was no way Cheney could have profited off of the Iraq war through Haliburton 2) They were also informed by *other* intelligence officials that Iraq *did* have WMDs. 
&gt; That was 100% the point of the Iraq war. Not buying it. Cheney was just the VP. He had little power. 
Ha! Okay... Do you really think Dubya was anything other than a puppet? Can you see his sparkling intellect reflected in his puppy portraits?
Oh goodness... We know they were informed by intelligence agents that there were no WMDs. Of course Cheneys bribes were hidden. Cheney isnt stupid. There were no valid reasons to invade Iraq. 
"Im not a fan of Rand and hes even more wrong this time. Cheney/Dubya/Blair all thought WMDs existed, despite some dissenting voices in the intelligence agencies. And there were numerous other reasons we went, not just for WMDs. We didnt get their oil or anything. And Cheney had no interest in Haliburton. "
People always issue this disclaimer before agreeing with anything the Paul family says. Its because theyre afraid of Obama supporters and the SJW-mafia giving them the scarlet letter for agreeing. We will have the same type of bad leadership until people can grow some balls and see past their little button-issues long enough to vote for a candidate like Rand.
"Why would we want a bunch of fake libertarians who think freedom is only for straight, white men?"
"Yeah, they were informed of that before they fucking invaded. "
people will believe anything these days...
"Yep, like believing Cheney thought there were WMDs."
Just because wmds was the pretext doesnt mean that the only reason for the war was personal profit. Just saying. ..
"Oh, I agree that it doesnt automatically mean that. However, when WMDs were basically the only excuse and all evidence points to all the death and destruction being purely for profit, its pretty silly to write it off."
"Heres the thing, Cheney isnt an ordinary guy. He went directly from running Americas military industrial complex to running America and immediately starting two wars, at least one for entirely made up reasons. "
"Im sorry but I dont buy it. I know it is fun to reduce Cheney to some kind of The Penguin evil criminal mastermind but I think it is far more likely that he is an ordinary man whos view is skewed by workings for companies that are involved in wars. You are constantly telling yourself that what you do matters, and that then shapes your worldview when events like 9/11 happen. It makes you believe that the American Army is a force for Good and that it is your duty to remove as many bad guys from the world as possible. It is never a matter of simple greed - people are just way too good at rationalizing for that to be the case."
So TRUE!!!
"Go learn what PNAC was, what IASPS was, and what their real neoconservative agenda was. It was not for oil, is was for an US dominated middle east to further protect Israel. Go read up on these groups. PS, they wanted into Iraq before Iraq switched off the petrodollar. Rand left that detail out because it would make his party look bad."
1. Political capital 2. Peak oil 3. he tried to kill my daddy 4. Profit
"CIA was wrong in 1996. Could have been again. The real point is that even is there was WMDs, or Saddam Hussein did help plan 9/11, that doesnt justify invading a country. I can forgive them being cautious of intelligence failures. I completely disagree with their actions even if they were right."
"It is disgusting. So, so sad. Ignoring the immediate deaths and horrors of war, imagine the good we could have done with that money..."
Having not put forth any fully featured counter proposal does though. 
"Even your own site rates that whole group of suggestions as barely effective. One of the ten is optimistically expected to affect 600,000 people total. This is exactly what I mean, we had and still have a systemic problem with how we pay for health care in this country. Simply updating the definition of tort and allowing trade associations to purchase on behalf of member businesses is nice PR but ultimately useless. The Dems stood up and fought for a reform, not a minor tweak of some regulations. "

"Every single time in history when a nations wealth divide got so great it has ended badly for the rich. The Czars, the King Louis XVI, and on and on. They always think they are invincible but forget they are only 1% of the population."
Well ... To be fair. The bottom 42% are shopping there
TIL: The bottom 42% provided them with this wealth 
Seems only appropriate since it is the bottom 42% that shops at Wal-Mart
Went to high school with James Walton...he drove a shitty 98 Dodge Durango to school every day and was a respectable dude. Never acted like he was better than anyone. His parents raised him well.
Great. Lets kill them and double our money!
"These statements are always so messed up. I have as much money as the bottom 10% of the US. The bottom 10% of the US has a deficit. They have no money. They have negative assists. They have debt. So if you have them beat by one damn dollar you have more money. Not saying this makes things right somehow, but these headlines always bug me."
When you put it like that it doesnt sound like much. Surely the bottom is full of people with 0 or even negative wealth from debt subtracting. 
Terrific. Every fucking day I see these statistics that mean absolutely nothing to anyone. *The top one percents water bill is equal to all the baby food eaten the other ninety-nine.

"Preemptive responses to the comments that come up: **Why is income inequality bad for the economy?** The economy functions when goods and services are produced and sold. The more goods and services are produced and sold, the healthier the economy is. Capitalism is generally considered a good thing because it encourages competition to make better goods and services. The wealthier will spend more money than the middle class who will spend more money than the poor, and thats fine as long as money is efficiently circulated. If income inequality gets to the levels it is at now, a very large percentage of the population will have little to no spending power and have to go into debt. Those at the top will have so much money that they are literally unable to spend (there are only so many cars, planes, vacations you can buy). So overall spending in the economy will go down, less goods and services will be produced, and the economy will be hurt. Now why was the economy seemingly functioning just fine before the recession? The poor and middle class had very little income, and had to go into debt to keep up their previous levels of spending. The rich had so much money they couldnt spend, that it was all funneled into savings and investment. People had a lot of incentive to borrow money, banks had a lot of incentive to lend money --&gt; high risk speculative investments, subprime mortgage rates, people encouraged to borrow against their houses, false AAA ratings --&gt; CRISIS. Now the problem is out in the open, the coping mechanisms are gone, and the economy isnt going to fully recover until these underlying problems are solved. The [last time that income inequality was this high](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/cassidy_01.jpg) was in 1928 right before the stock market crashed and caused the Great Depression. **What can be done about it?** Many minor policy changes will help. Raise minimum wage so that anyone living in this country can have a decent standard of living. That doesnt mean that managers shouldnt be earning more, or that CEOs shouldnt be earning significantly more. Increasing taxes on the rich is also not as dramatic as it sounds. There was a [90% marginal tax rate on the highest income bracket for a long time] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Historical_Mariginal_Tax_Rate_for_Highest_and_Lowest_Income_Earners.jpg) in the United States. Its important to understand what marginal tax means - 90% tax for income over $10 million for someone who makes $12 million would mean that only $2 million is taxed at that rate not the whole $12 million. And then there are capital gains that arent taxed at all for no reason. In general, theres a need to reform the tax code because the lawyers of multimillionaires are able to use loopholes to keep most of the money from being taxed at all. **What can I do about it?** Get educated and educate others! Its very easy to become misinformed about topics like this, especially with the current state of our media. People like Robert Reich have been pointing out this income inequality problem for a long time, but nobody paid attention until after the recession. Watch [this movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9REdcxfie3M) or read one of his books - Supercapitlism or Beyond Outrage."
"People keep focusing on jobs when they really mean income. Income is why we sell the best years of our life anyway, not for some feeling of duty to work. Do we feel the same about people that literally do no work at all, but have plenty of money to survive? Nope. Would it be so bad if people had enough income to survive, but only worked 20-30 hours a week? Nope. Lets stop focusing on our work itself and start focusing on the reason why we work, money. Businesses need less and less labor, because productivity keeps increasing. Our distorted virtue of work is incompatible with reality. We cant maintain full employment with increasing productivity on a planet with finite resources. We just need to find ways to more equitably distribute the income from production. Right now we accept the Ferengi way of life and all want to climb up the economic pyramid on the backs of our neighbors. In other words we all want to have many times more goods and services flow to us for the goods and services we work to create. No, owning a company full of people providing goods and services DOES NOT mean that one has provided others with those goods and services. Those that one feeds on for ones income by owning that business are the ones that provided those goods and services. We can delude ourselves about this when it comes to innovative new business models, but when it comes to simple, established items like food, its obvious that theyre just full of themselves. So often the owners just hire others to do the mental work required to manage their property anyway. I dont have the answers, but I know that most of us will effectively become slaves if we do not reverse the trend of consolidation of wealth. Time is money. When we accept such income disparity what we are actually accepting is a time disparity. We accept that some work a very long time for a little while others work very little time for a lot. How can we not see this as servitude? Are we that blinded by the shine of the mansions and yachts we covet? We are consenting to our own enslavement by accepting this race to the top of the pyramid of exploitation. We dont live to work, we work to live. Lets not forget that."

This title just strengthens my belief that we need redistribution of wealth.
The obscenity and blatant immorality of this is completely missed by the vast majority of Americans.
Wow 2% in less than a year!?!?! They gained 2% more of the wealth of the population in less than a year!!!!! So if that trend continues then we have about 34 more years until the Waltons own us all. So when are we gonna stop them?
The title tries to make this sound bad. Sounds like that 42 percent need to get off their ass.
And in a country where dollars work better than votes.
If you take a historical perspective these people will be seen only as successful owners of people. 
"The Walton family does not even own 45% of Walmart. Hell, I own 223 shares of Walmart...Im not a rich man."
"The bottom 40% has 0.2% of the wealth, why should this kind of statistic be suprising."
"If they invest their money, rather than keeping it in the bank, how is this a bad thing? If their money is just going in to the stock market, or to invest in startups as angel investors, or any number of other investments, how is them having a lot of money any worse than a hedge fund or angel investor having lots of money?"
owns 33% of walmart
"Wait... are we counting their food stamps as wealth? Because if we are, Im calling bullshit... /s"

I always wonder the purpose of having that much. What items are they saving for? What will they do with *that* much money?
"Oh weird, a family that inherited their fathers massive multinational company, that he built from a $20k loan at 26, has a lot of wealth? Who would have thought? I bet he built the company up to being that wealthy by complaining about what other people are doing with their lives. Successful entrepreneurs. What assholes. "
Which they have because they push healthcare costs back on the state. Why take care of your employees when Medicaid will do it for you?
Interesting because that bottom 42% gave that wealth to them. 
"But if we raise the minimum wage, theyll be forced to raise their prices, right? Those costs have got to be passed on to the consumer, right?"
The fundamental problem is that Capitalism and Marxism are both equally bad but most people dont understand that. There isnt really a system that people can uniformly rally around. If I had to come up with one it would be a non-race related Nationalist model. There is no system that rewards a group like the Waltons that is also for the better good of a people.
I bet it really peeves them that those 42% get more votes than they do. 
Jealousy is an ugly thing.
"Hate Walmart, left it and two years later got hired for a warehousing company who then signed a contract with them shipping their shit. "
this makes sense because the bottom 42% of American spend 100% of their money at Wal-Mart
Those bottom 43 percent all shop at Walmart
"I know you sheeple are circlejerking your libtard retarded bullshit, but the Walton family deserve every goddamn cent they got, and the mob affiliation accusations are bullshit. Just because someone isnt a lazy neckbeard dosent mean they cant keep their well deserved money. Fuck all of oyu."
"[According to this study](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/basics/story/2012-05-12/households-net-worth-university-of-michigan/54912016/1) if you have even $1 (one dollar) in net worth, you are doing better than 25% of American households. That should put the 42% in better perspective. "
Well thats not saying much since a huge percentage of Americans have negative net worth (their debts are more than their assets). I probably have net worth greater than the bottom 25-30% of Americans combined for that reason.
Sounds like an argument for ending welfare to me.
Do you know how hard it was to inherit all that money?
REPOST #47 siince 1995!
The real problem is how difficult it is to get *into* that family.
Redistribution of wealth?
Isnt WAL-Mart a publicly traded company as NYSE:WMT? How can it be said they Own it? Shouldnt it be said that the shareholders own it?
"Good for them, hopefully someday with enough work Ill have something to leave my family too."
"If we were to compare the Vanderbilts or Rockefellers to the bottom percent of Americans at their peak, what percent of the bottom would their wealth have been equal to?"
"Low income student here, just remember that you dont need a shit load of money to live, you can get by with just a tiny bit of money and still have an awesome and happy life. I dont really care about the terrible Walton family, they can go fuck them-selves hard. I work at in the Kroger Produce Dept. so I get to eat all of what managers calls, unsaleable foods or scrapes, which most of the time those particular unsaleable foods are just amazing to the taste buds. Im not rich, but Im happy. Thats what counts, right? "
"the investor class fucks have redistributed the wealth from the working class up to themselves in earnest since 79 - time to return the favor: wealth tax, transaction tax on all trades, raise capital gains (first home exempted), penalize at 100% all money moved offshore to avoid tax, value added tax, means-test out of social security, lift the cap on what those earning over $107K pay in (yes, they pay less), asset-charge-off on the top 1%, all civil and criminal fines based upon total wealth (so a speeding ticket for a billionaire would be like $145,000) ... long overdue to redistribute the wealth to everyone"
Came you imagine how fancy their Thanksgivings must be? They probably like do a turducken but with like ostrich. 
Good for them!
this is not surprising and this is nothing new....plus how many of the bottom 42% are CUSTOMERS of theirs.
"I have so little faith in the future of the worlds economy that I actually regret having kids, and in turn, grandkids."
Its may be conservative to say this but they mostly do other things such as partially own other businesses or whatever and not just be heirs to Sam Walton as the title seems to imply
The Waltons are exactly whats wrong with this country. Evil incarnate. Never - EVER - shop at Walmart. Theres no excuse.
"This article is hugely misleading. First of all their wealth as a family is derived from stock and asset control not direct profit from the stores; Its all relative to how well their company is performing in trades on the NYSE not to the irrelevant number of sales revenue that the article points out. And yes I know the revenue number drives stock prices, but the prices in actuality are driven more by things such as employee count, profit margin, and market control. Which brings me to my second point, despite having 469 billion in sales they only turn around a 3 percent profit margin which means when all is said and done and the bills are paid including salaries the end result net income of that 469 billion is 17 billion dollars. Which in a lot of cases would not leave a lot extra left over for increases in salaries for those 2.2 million employees that everyone is always barking about saving from the evils of Walmart or 1.3 million if you only care about America. I dont agree with their business practices which is why I dont shop there. Their low prices are derived from deviously low wages that are supplemented by government assistance to their workers who are not earning a living wage. The only reason why they can have such low prices is because they are getting a tax break through an off book channel through their employees as opposed to actual corporate government assistance. Everyone who complains has a right to not shop in such companies, and they also have the right to not participate in their stock. But frankly complaining about someone who uses the system in the way that its set up to be used, that is not Walmarts fault. And they have no obligation by law to pay more than the minimum wage. Politicians can gas up a room with these arguments as much as they want to get votes but the reality is they are all pocketing money from these companies to keep their respective seats in office on both sides of the aisle. "
their primary demographic...irony lives.
"It is not a fair comparison. You cannot compare personal wealth with a companys equity, much less a Group of companies equity."
"Or, re-stated, The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the clients of Wal-mart."
"Stop shopping at Wal-Mart! It has been over 10 years since I have been in a Wal-Mart (or Sams Club) and I never intend on going back in one again. If you live in Wisconsin or Northern Illinois, get your food at Woodmans. Its employee owned. Unfortunately theyre not allowed to set up unions, but no one is perfect. "
STOP SHOPPING AT WAL-MART IDIOTS
What is the problem with this? Why is this not Ok? Is it not Ok to be wealthy?
So what - there is nothing wrong with having wealth.
"So what? Poor people always whine that so and so is as rich as bla bla bla percent of the poorest in the world. If you dont have capital, fuck off. You need money to live. "
"No shit, the bottom 42 percent shop at Wal-mart..."
Didnt they earn it by being good businessmen? Isnt it something good? Can someone explain to me why people hate Walmart?
"If subsequently anyone proceeds thinks that the Walton family has therefore brought an equal value to our economy as the bottom 42 percent of Americans, they need to have their head examined. The values assigned different paths through our society is only very loosely correlated with the true value. Nowhere is this more apparent than when looking at the top 1%. "
"Yeah and these are the same type of people that move production to China etc because local labour costs are too high. Pssshhht, the problem is that they are greedy beyond any measure."
They control all the stocks of this publicly traded company? Also: love the wealth distribution posts. I assume everyone posting them is making sure all the other poor people in the neighbourhood and city they live in is getting money from them too? I assume youre taking a homeless person to a movie and/or letting them play your PS4 on your big screen? 
"People seriously need to realize that this isnt new. Take a look at Carnegie, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, etc. This income inequality issue is real, but only in the sense that the government has sold out the solid blue collar jobs that allowed people to support families with.

Yeah fuck capitalism
"After watching a Walmart documentary my friend runs around campus screaming, Walmart is evil!"
.000000018% of the population has money equal to what the bottom 42% have. Great direction our country is headed.
Good thing they pay taxes on it and otherwise invest the bulk of their funds into driving the economy...
"The Waltons make almost none of their income off of the performance of the stores. Not directly anyway. They own a non-majority stake of the company through shares they inherited. They get income from the dividends these shares earn. As it is, the shares that make up their net respective net worths are just money that exists on paper. They dont actually have that kind of cash laying around in bank accounts, etc. Now, if they converted the stocks to cash by selling them, thatd be a bit different. But castigating these people because of some net worth figure that exits only on paper is kind of silly."
"Walmart used to actually take really good care of their employees. That is, until Sams bunch of half-wit kids took over. Theyre a greedy bunch of little shits. Still, I shop at walmart, and even if you did have the mom and pop shops still around, you would too. Walmart didnt take over for no reason. They have an incredibly simple, yet effective business model: everything in one place for cheaper than anyone else. Its easy to be idealistic when you have nothing at stake, but when youre stretching every dollar you can to make ends meet, the difference between paying $800 a month for groceries at walmart vs $1100 at the local grocer is a no-brainer. Also, shopping at Target doesnt make you a better person, youre just feeding a different beast. Quit trying to claim moral superiority. "
Went to school with one of the Waltons grandchildren. Was a humble kid.
Yep the Waltons are rich. WTF does this have to do with politics?

"I dont get these kinds of critical titles. I mean, obviously, they went out of their comfort zone, risked everything and made their business big. What the fuck is wrong with that? Of course they are gonna be rich. Of course a person who takes the safe route (college, someones employee) will not have the same fortune as someone who does NOT take the safe route, risks everything and succeeds. Now, how they treat their employees is another issue."
Oh god. That is actually worse than even I thought. I guess they are getting richer and the bottom is getting poorer so they difference is getting greater at an alarming rate. The power shift with be enormous.
Better redistribute their wealth. 
Perhaps we should forcibly redistribute their wealth with a bullet or 10?
Sounds like the bottom 42% need to pick it up a bit.
"Nobody mentions the fact that the Walton family donated $300 million to The University of Arkansas, the state that holds WalMart HQ, and continues to donate. http://admissions.uark.edu/1456.php"
And? I hate when being successful is made out to be a bad
So they are massively in debt?
I fail to see the problem with this.
Kill them and take their money americans!
"Sam Walton had to borrow $30,000 to open his first store. "
The best way to fight them is to raise a generation of kids that think Walmart is gross. 
"Should be illegal. I dont understand why these people would keep this much money to themselves, and not change the world for the better. So greedy its scary. "
"Ey, its a meritocracy, why dont you believe it? Believe it!"
Who knew Bill Walton was this rich?
Why are we punishing success by insinuating that maybe its wrong for a handful of people to have the same amount of money as 131 million people combined?
IM. SO. ANGRY. GIVE ME MONEY. RRRRAAAAAAAA
We know already. Bother you? Stop fucking shopping at walmart. Not really much more you can do other than bitch about it.
"My god, what a biased title. U jelly?"
"Cut them a break, they earned it. Not everyone works hard enough to end up in the right womb."
"Oh, Ghettomart..."
"thanks for the weekly reminder, reddit."
So?
"So what do we do about it? Outside of taking every last penny and distributing it equally to the bottom 42 percent, what can be done?"
Wealth.... Not income. Bill Gates by himself has a net worth of more than half the Waltons combined net worth. In all honesty I am surprised the Waltons net worth is not more.

Their number one customers. 
"This sub has become such a blatant Circlejerk. Its not even interesting to read anymore. Even when good content is posted (rarely) the comments are just filled with hate and bashing, as well as hiveminded opinions. Any facts, opinions, or statements that conflict with the generally accepted position (no matter how intelligent or well presented) are Downvoted to oblivion. There is no room in /r/politics for any intelligent discussion. No acceptance for differing views.

This statistic is almost unbelievable. Maybe these guys will be future Marie Antoinettes when the seemingly unavoidable revolution occurs (as has happened throughout history in instances of extreme consolidation of wealth).
why is anyones fiances anyone else s business?
Yeah so what? Thats what happens when you own a successful buisness. You become tah dah!!!! successful. What is the point of this post?
"yeah we know. man, this subreddit regurgitates facts a lot. *all this talk but no action.*"
Im surprised its not higher
Who cares? They created it- its theirs. 
"So? Great success yields great fortune. I realize the nineteen-year-old reddit socialism adherents would love to create discord, but no; they made that fortune fair and square. Good for them. "
I feel like this is posted every 2 weeks....
we need robin hood
"As well they should. Someone in their immediate ancestry made such wealth possible for them, so they are honor-bound to create jobs for the rest of us. ^^^^/s If there is any hope left, it lies with the proles."
"So? Have the Waltons broken any laws? Other than jealousy and envy, why should they be forced to give any more than the taxes that they already pay to anyone else? Have you any idea how much Wal-Mart pays annually in taxes? Over $7 billion. Perhaps we *should* penalize the corporation, kill some jobs, and ultimately kill this golden goose - then we can watch as many wasteful social program begin to wither and rot on the governmental vine because they lack funding. Heres the $7 billion source: http://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Wal-Mart-Stores-Inc/Financial-Statement/Statement-of-Cash-Flows"
I thought it would have been 47 percent...
The wealth distribution is completely fine!
If this is a problem for people maybe its time to seek out alternatives to walmart as a consumer with the aim to weaken their position and increase competition. 
"The fact is the family DOES have a controlling share in the corporation but none of them have anything what-so-ever to do with how the company has been ran since Sam died. Yes they still get their cut but to blame the managerial practices on his grandkids isnt completely fair. As someone who was raised in Waltonville this is where I have a serious conflict. Its true that the current incarnation of Walmart is a textbook version of the purist form of megacorporation that could exist, raping the land and the peoples all in an effort to increase its base margin BUT the original incarnation built this tiny town into what it is today: a proud city with art, food and music that cant be found within a 500 mile radius...all of which is due to the charity work of the daughters and grandchildren of Sam Walton. It might not seem like much to the rest of the nation and I am in no way condoning the actions of the corporate douchebags who are raping our work force but Ive got to say that, here, in their hometown, the Waltons have always done right by their neighbors."
Obviously we should execute the Walton family and redistribute the wealth to the bottom 42 percent.
I dont understand how a family can be so greedy. I mean you have the opportunity to make the lives of a significant amount of people better without harming your own quality of living significantly and they choose not too.
"I think when you get that filthy rich, all bets are off. You should have to pay for everything. Fire at your house? better have hired a private firefighting company. Break in? Private security. Make no law apply to them at all so if they show their greedy faces in public theyd better have a small army with them because murder will not stick. Its already that way for them, as no rich fuck ever gets convicted of shit, at least this way we can take a few out for sport on weekends."
why are all the scores hidden?
Does this measurement of wealth include debt as a negative of worth? Ive always wondered if Im considered a negative value (in terms of wealth) because of these shitty student loans.
The Waltons also give nothing to charity. Theyre everything wrong with this greed fuelled economy.
"I really think somebody should make an updated Poor Richards Almanac people are content with their wuality of life because they dont know anything else - and thats fine. But if somebody were to point out the opportunities available to them along with how to utilise em, itd be a win-win with everybody. Everybody has a skill; and everybody is willing to pay somebody to use it. I really do hope that somebody finds a way to help these people out... Obviously, only if they want to be helped. Not because i say that they have a shitty way of life, just because i dont like people believing they cant get better when they can - they just gotta look for it."
Its easy. Just hire the bottom 42 percent of americans and cut their pay in half.
"Thats really fucking cool. Wow, pretty inspiring. Oh wait.. Was this supposed to be a negative thing? Oh yeah I forgot, they have more than me so Im supposed to be jealous and hate them and call for new laws that take their money away from them and give it to me."
"Does them being super rich somehow make me poorer? I dont get why its such a huge deal that the top 1% has so much money. If I have a steady job, am able to live in a decent house, drive a good car, and take care of my child, why should I care that they have so much? Sure there is poverty in this country but what are they supposed to do? Give their money away? A lot of them donate billions to charity."
"Capitalism, thats what im talking about!"
Isnt it weird how riots dont happen at walmarts all across the nation?
Wal-mart is also the worst paying job in America 
How the fuck is Walmart not a monopoly?
As capitalists though dont the Waltons have a fairly socialist agenda... Not so conservative so to speak. Happy to be schooled on this.
"Again with this communist bill maher rhetoric. Business leaders put out way more money than they actually make by creating jobs. The wealth a CEO has is only a tiny fraction of the wealth they created and id be willing to bet they give a sizable amount of that fraction to charities too (whether they do that as a tax write off or because they genuinely want to help is irrelevant. Its still a good thing), yet somehow they are greedy and selfish. "
"And it all started with a guy who never took a dime from the Govt and drove a ratty old pick up truck. Andrew Carnegie was once a penniless immigrant. And look what he built. Bill Gates was writing Basic code before he made his Billions. Have you ever heard the story about that guy who developed Facebook? Income inequality is just another contrived demon form the left. If someone is content eating the scraps that fell off a rich mans table, good for you. But if you want to make it, youre going to have to work for it. Thats life. Fair is a place where cows go to compete for ribbons."
"They worked for it and built themselves an empire. This is america, this is fundamentally the American way. People who cry about this are probably the same people who think everyone should get a trophy in kids sports. "
"Jokes on them. Lots of those folks have a negative net worth. Suck it, Waltons."
"I feel the need to, once again, point out what bullshit statistics these are. I really wish people would educate themselves as to how wealth is calculated and how to accrue it. If I told you I was wealthier than the bottom 25% of Americans combined, you might not think I was a Walton, but youd surely assume I was well off. Nah. Im middle class at best. Due to the way wealth is calculated, [being wealthier than the bottom 25% of Americans is as easy as having no debt and $5 to your name.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2011/12/14/six-waltons-have-more-wealth-than-the-bottom-30-of-americans/) But remember, negative net worth does NOT mean someone is *poor*. Many people with negative net worth are highly paid professionals who have large houses (and large mortgages to go with those houses) as well as hefty student loan debt. The people being counted among the bottom 25% of Americans with negative net worth *could very well have six or seven figure salaries*. This is why its ridiculous to see this dead horse beaten at least once a week. Im not saying the Waltons arent ludicrously wealthy. Nor am I saying theyre good people worth defending. Im saying if you want to attack them, *attack them where theyve actually done something wrong*. In the meantime, everyone could do with a healthy self-education regarding wealth accrual. Forbes hosts and supports [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/), a website that is pretty much the Wikipedia for personal finance. I guarantee almost everyone can learn something from this site. It almost certainly wont make you Walton-rich, but if you follow its lessons youll certainly be on the way to a better future and retirement."
"Im amazed at the number of people out there that dont see the problem in this. They have no issue with some CEO pulling in $10, 20 or even 100+ million dollars. These people actually defend the obscene salaries and cant put two-and-two together to understand that a wealth distribution as lopsided as this pulls money out from the poor and middle class and concentrates it at the top. Its a direct reason *why* Walmart workers are paid so poorly because most of the money goes to only a few keys people. Its *because* of these practices that full time workers for these companies cant make ends meet, and as such need to go on public assistance, making them a burden on regular tax payers."
Good for them!
Night John-Boy
"I dont get people. Maybe im an idiot, but i just feel people are entitled to the money theyve earned."
They must have worked really really hard. /s
Damn them. So what can we do to them? Jack taxes up? Theyll just move their money. Confiscate their assets and redistribute the money? Seriously I see all these posts bemoaning the money the wealthy have yet no solutions. The wealthy are always going to have a bigger percentage.
Niceeee
...and I still have to wait 40 fucking minutes in line to check out.
"If this fact bothers you then the first thing you can do to help is stop shopping at walmart. Ive started ordering some home supplies off amazon, they ship it for free automatically every few months and its just as cheap for me. Theres always another choice if you look around. The I wish I could shop somewhere else is just a lazy excuse."
uhm yeah? they own freaking Wal-Mart. 
"You have to understand that a large chunk of the bottom 42% dont own ANY wealth. Hell, I own more actual wealth than a percent or two of Americans. "
Good for them. 
"Capitalism is awesome! Nothing at all wrong with this. They earned it! Theyre successful! Say this is sickening or something should be done to solve this problem, or even think its a problem at all, youre evil un-American commie scum. -lots of idiots on the internet and the telly"
Basic Income just starts to make more and more sense. http://www.dailyfinance.com/2013/11/27/switzerland-basic-income-guarantee-fight-poverty/
So?
"And the bottom 35% or something are either in debt or balanced out by those in debt, so a more accurate count would be earning capacity.. this headline keeps popping up without anyone taking note of that."
And this shows capitalisms failure.
Coincidentally (or not) they also control the wealth of the bottom 42%.
"We must raise the highest marginal tax rates back to ,at least, 70%. Probably higher. Does anyone think these people actually work? I mean, besides having their accountant deposit their dividend check from the slave labor and dead Bangaladesh textile workers."
"faulty example taken for political purposes, their, held assets may be greater, obviously, as the bottom 42% holds little to no assets in savings, many are in debt, etc. Their revenue and total spending or all the money the take and spend grossed isnt. So what you would imagine from the example and following political argument does not follow from an honest interpretation of the information, normal for liberals."
"Okay, thats just their wealth. What are they doing with it? Example: I trust Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to do bigger and more effective things (per dollar) in the philanthropic or tech advancement arenas than ANY other government or average person. They run their charities like they ran their businesses - thats something that the average person (no matter their nationality) is incapable of."
"...please please Please post the lynching to Youtube, fuck the fiefdom."
This is what is wrong with the world. Greed is stupid. 
"Lets not forget they also serve probably more than 90% of all of America, not to mention the 100s of millions internationally. Youd have this much wealth if you served as many people as they do."
They created more value than the bottom forty something percent combined too. Amazing how that works
Yet they let their employees suffer.
"I wonder if theyre all total dicks. At least one of them should aspire to be like Elon Musk and bring us awesome things like electric cars, online payment systems, and space-flight in the private sector."
Im not surprised. Theyre the most successful business in the country.
So what they cant be rich? is what my uncle said when I brought this up at Thanksgiving dinner. 
But they worked so hard for that money. They deserve it! 
So lets go over to their house and take it from them guys
So this is why when people *protest* Wal-Mart the [swat team intervenes](https://www.google.com/search?q=wal+mart+protest+swat+&amp;oq=wal+mart+protest+swat+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6936j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8)
Facism
Just a matter of time until that 42% revolts. 
Good for them. Its every Americans dream to do this well in buisness.
They are wealthier than me and therefore I hate them. 
Those Walmart greeters must point guns at shoppers and force them to spend money there.
Good for them. 
Sincere congratulations to the Waltons!
Television has fucked up everyones view of the world. The super wealthy really think they have to be villains. Sudden clarity Clarence! In the real world there are no super heros. &amp; all you need to do to be a villain is have more money than everyone else. O_o holy shit. Were literally doomed and were making jokes about it. 
"Pssh. Given the fact that theyre probably all piss broke, **I** have as much wealth as the bottom 20% combined. I was evil enough to attend college, get a decent job, and *(horrors)* save for retirement. Moonbats crack me up, they think its a shocking statistic that half of all Americans have below median income."
And? Im supposed to be offended because someone made a shit ton of money?
Wealth does not equal cash. A lot of what they have is stock and the value of Wal Marts assets. Not exactly liquid assets. 
I am the 42%
By my calculations that makes about tree fiddy. Not that impressive. 
"I hated Walmart before, now I hate them even more."
"Thats because this one family worked harder than the bottom 42% of Americans combined! Theyre Makers, not Takers! /s"
Good. Now lets continue giving those Waltons taxpayer funded subsidies and using the free market as a scapegoat.
These posts are pissing me off
"Hey didnt Sam Walton build that shit from scratch and it wasnt until after his death that everything went to hell? Yep, thought so."
"Why is this an issue? The family that built a massive business that actually pays better and offers more benefits that the businesses they displaced, while lowering costs for its customers, which included the employees who also get a substantial discount. Some on reddit have an irrational hatred of Wlamart"
A bum on the street has more net worth than &gt;20% of Americans. 40% of Americans have les than 10k net worth.
wow. bunch of fucking whiners in here.. you want to be rich? go earn it..
ITT: Jealousy and socialism
Thats because the bottom 42% are supporting them. It really is a vicious cycle.
Id be interested in knowing what percent of the bottom 42% do the majority of their shopping at Wal-Mart. Anybody have that info?
Okay... So... Pillage all of their money?
Their wealth includes the company value though. This fact is equivalent to saying Walmart is a big company! It certainly wouldnt help the poor to liquidate the company and distribute it to them.
"So, if we seized their entire fortune and distributed it evenly between all americans, we would each get about $435."
"well, yeah. he started one of the largest companies in american history. also, that value isnt just sitting in a bank either, it likely consists of lots of walmart stock. (remember how some times bill gates is the richest man in the world and sometimes hes not? that is the same logic. his value fluctuates with the value of ms stock)."
Boycott walmart this christmas and next year. That would be enough to get rid of them.
"So? Its also the largest retailer in the world. I mean, Im not defending their practices... but the numbers are pretty meaningless. Its not like.. the waltons could give up all their stuff and now the bottom 42 percent of Americans would be rich.. theyd just have twice as much money. "
How high in percentage of the bottom do you have to go to reach a net worth of $0? Dont a ton of people have negative net worth?
[deleted]
"Us population is roughly 314,000,000 so that makes them worth as much as 132,000,000 actual people."
Good for them.
How to attain karma 101. #1 Post Flagpole Sitta to /r/music. #2 Post anything about the NSA. #3 Inform everyone of how much money the Waltons have. #4 Cat pictures. #5 Gore and fedoras.
Well damn near everything I own comes from walmart so it makes sense.
"You should really be comparing income inequality instead of wealth inequality due to the fact that a lot of poorer people have income, but have zero or negative net wealth due to debt."
Those money making bastards. How dare they be rich. There should be a law that youre not allowed to have more than $1000 at any one time so no one will be rich and everyone will be pure and virtuous 
"OK . . . its a nice statistic that is supposed to be scary. But whats your point? Many people have a negative net worth because they have a mortgage/car loan/etc. So a homeless person with a dollar in his pocket could have more wealth than someone living in the suburbs. If you hate the Walton family so much, just stop shopping at Wal-Mart. It really isnt that complicated or hard to do. They offer good and services that can be found just as easily."
"This thread is full of people who dont realize or care that you cant run a successful economy with this level of lopsidedness in wealth. You can deify them and praise them and give them burnt offerings to appease them, but you cant run an economy based on how many ivory helicopters the 400 richest families in the country are planning to buy this year. Wal-Mart is killing itself off by siphoning too much too quickly from the very consumers it depends on."
"The rich being less rich would not necessarily make the poor less poor. Further, the growing wealth disparity has not resulted in the poor being worse off. Look at the actual numbers. Stop buying into sensationalist garbage meant to divide people into us vs. them. "
The Waltons are despicable people who will continue stripping the world of everything around us.
"Therefore, lets get them. Rich is bad. Reddit logic 101. Ugh."
how long until wal-mart has a private army?
DAE LE AMERICAN DREAM
OMG!! The government should take that wealth away from them. They should also charge the president for all of his trips that are taken in a very lavish style. That just aint fittin when 90% of all Americans are starving to death.
It doesnt matter. Why should I be jealous? They wont have that forever. If Granddaddy Walton worked that hard and wanted to leave that to them its his choice. I dont really care. I dont shop at Walmart. Its such a non issue. They just want to distract you from bad healthcare laws and NSA spying by pointing out some people are stupid rich.
Well they invented Walmart so thats not surprising... Whats the story here exactly? Someone has more money than me and so that makes them evil?
Whoop dee do. A baby born yesterday has more wealth than the bottom 25%. Reddit logic -&gt; babies are evil!
And guess what. They gather that money by providing products and services people want. Wouldnt it be just awful if they forced people to pay it under threat of imprisonment... Oh wait. 
"Reading this discussion makes me happy of being European. Even if i end up losing my job, im not to get worried about my healthcare since it is free, or my kids education since its free as well. Maybe we pay more taxes in europe and our rich people are less rich, but im so happy to not having to be worried ending sick on a street if i lose my job."
Because the bottom 42% of Americans spend all their money at Walmart
"I have a job, asswipe. I dont have time to listen to anything. I dont like the idea of the government using public money to shore up failing private companies. I would like a citation for your 90% statistic though."
"Right. You dont have time, except youre posting on Reddit. You dont like ANYTHING is my guess. You wouldnt have the government funding medical research? Roads? Nothing. You want to send us back to the 18th Century. Heres your citation: [**HERE**](http://www.energyfactcheck.org/slideshow/renewable-energy-subsidies-prop-up-an-otherwise-economically-unviable-industry-we-should-level-the-playing-field-by-removing-clean-energy-handouts-and-let-renewables-compete-with-fo/) Its better than I thought - its **97%** &gt;As of late July, 2012, Solyndra, Abound Solar and the handful of other DOE-backed renewable energy companies that went bankrupt represented total investments of less than 3% of the total DOE portfolio.

"a little irrelevant? &gt; Lies just make for better soundbites. When someone is able to entirely make up their statements (wont call them facts), they can use whatever words are easiest to fit into a small span of time. instead of going on a rant about al gore, care to elaborate about this article specifically?"
"That is exactly what I was talking about. Best case: (1) Originator says something mostly right (maybe slips a bit), (2) Someone paraphrases it to make a headline, (3) Someone Else re-paraphrases, (4) People think they are direct quotes. And that is when someone starts from accurate things. But when someone can just start with bullshit it goes even faster. There are a ton of (extra?) crazy false quotes attributed to Michelle Bachman (and I will honestly admit I believed them because I think she is already crazy). The greatest example of attacking the middle class I can think of is associating college education with the liberal agenda. Makes voters turn against efforts to make college affordable. If your kids go to college, they are going to turn into gay loving liberals. (Or even just saying it will make them gay.)"
"FYI - Al Gore never claimed to have invented the Internet. He claimed, rather in articulately, to have supported economic and legislative initiatives that contributed to the rise if the Internet. http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp"
"Well... if the Middle Class werent boned before... *Lies just make for better soundbites.* When someone is able to entirely make up their statements (wont call them facts), they can use whatever words are easiest to fit into a small span of time. E.g. I suspect Al Gores famous I invented the internet! claim was the result of reports asking him over and over again to explain his role in the transfer of DARPA-net to the universities. I can easily imagine it starting with, According to standard protocol, I, as VP, am the last one to sign on a bill like this (only with more words and preciseness). Then as he was asked to make it more concise, he eventually said sarcastically, I invented the internet. Complex things are pretty much defenseless against lies-based smear campaigns."
"Why the /s? If you make minimum wage or even say $15.00/hr and have $100 or $200 taken from your check each month under threat of tax penalties (which can lead to jail), that is money that you need for rent and food that you no longer have control of. It goes to Obamas Ins. Co. friends, who also get tax dollars to cover the portion of your premium that you arent paying. **But you have insurance so thats great, right?** Wrong. At poverty wages, you simply cant afford to use your 5k to 8k deductible plan. So you are forced to pay for something you cant use and your standard of living is reduced. You have insurance but it amounts to a disaster plan that will only help you if you get cancer or something dire, and even then the deductibles will bankrupt you. So yay for Obamacare. In care you are wondering, the reason that pre-exesting conditions are no longer allowed as exclusionary is so that these kinds of people can be covered...their premiums and the tax subsidies that go along with them are gravy for the insurance companies. Millions of people forced to purchase subsidized insurance they cant afford to use. I agree, American Republicans are a weird bunch but Obamacare is corporate welfare pure and simple...sold as socialism to create another wedge issue to divide and conquer the morons."
"I agree that single provider or single payer is better, and there is a lot of corporate welfare in ACA, but your example is exaggerated at best, and the youth who dont benefit from insurance become the elderly who do. "
"&gt;If you make minimum wage or even say $15.00/hr and have $100 or $200 taken from your check each month under threat of tax penalties (which can lead to jail), [Lie.

Fine. Ill concede the jail part. These people are still **forced to pay for insurance they cant use**. You dont seem to care about that. Chances are you are happy being on your parents cushy corporate plan until you are 26 and then getting one of your own. YOU will probably never need (or at least dont think you will need -- good luck being part of the vanishing middle class) subsidized care. Those people have had their standard of living reduced and if they get sick and cant meet their deductible insurance wont pay jack. Docs/hospitals can deny them treatment in that case (except for emergency care). So their level of care hasnt increased from pre-Obamacare days and they have less money to live on...the insurance companies get this money PLUS tax subsides. But who wins? Not Obamas Insurance Co. friends...no way....not the hopey changey President...he wouldnt do that.
&gt;Chain Email Could have told you right there it was bullshit.
Its fun watching this stuff appear in my facebook feeds.
My god - so sick of how utterly absent of common sense the haters on the right are. Why do they think ignorance is bliss? 
I know a number of conservatives who believe just about anything that drops into the email box about Obama...
http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/executiveorders.asp in case youre interested in facts
"3,522 executive orders...how does that even happen?"
"i like how obama fanboys consider this a good thing. sure, our president is totally ineffectual, but we get to pwn republicans with his impotent uselessness!"
The stupid in this is strong but will be believed.
Just goes to show you how much underlying racism (and stupidity) remains in this country.
"oh we are posting about chain emails now? i got 20 last week saying Barack HUsSAIN OBAMA was a musilUUM and should be impeached. can we stop the circle jerk please? republicans are dumb we get it, can we get some real posts on /r/politics now?"
Every chain email Ive ever received about Obama has been a lie! 
"Politifact needs to extend their rating scale downwards, in my opinion. Pants on fire is like a 1 on a 0-10 scale. 0 would be something like parallel-universe fantasy."
I really wanna meet the people who write these chain emails. How do you write something so blatantly false to justify opposition to X without questioning your own opposition?
Theyre probably just trying to make a run at [Politifacts Lie of the Year Title](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/). I seriously doubt theyll be able dethrone the defending champ.
"The worst part is when you try to correct their facts, they take it personally and get angry."
Sad bottom line is -- If the modern American right stops lying they will never have a chance in any election. Their true intentions have become so selfish and evil that they must be hidden from the middle and lower class dimwits that continually vote against their own self interests. 
"Debunking is fine and should be done, but its rarely effective on rightwing types. Their religion has systematically taught them to accept extreme ideas with no evidence. "
hail ceasar
Politifact is getting some great visibility on /r/politics today. I am quite pleasantly surprised.
"What I cant figure out is why with so many credible reasons to attack the President (NSA, lack of holding banks accountable, allowing a plutocracy to rise within our midst, drone strikes against American citizens without trial, NSA, complete lack of anything remotely like oversight of the intelligence community, etc.) the Gang Of Plutocrats needs to make up shit. Must be that classic conservative psychological projection. The Republicans dont want to highlight those very real problems and abuses because they are just waiting their turn at the wheel."
"Choo Choo! Everyone onboard the Republican hate Bandwagon! Safe your nobelpiecepriceweddingbombers honor! He well deserves it! Free shit everywhere! Free lunch for everyone! Free healthcare for everyone! Hell, i dont even know why anyone in america would want to work these days! Just ask your president, he sure as hell has a free salary for each and every one of you! Go OBAMA GO OBAMA! "
So were fact-checking chain emails now? 
Either Obama is such a good (Republican) president that the Republicans have to make stuff up about him to oppose him or the Republicans are so averse to telling the truth that they cant bring themselves to address legitimate concerns.
"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-barack-obama-has-signed-1000-ex/ Pants On Fire: Chain email claims Barack Obama has signed 1,000 executive orders to grab power from Congress "

How many such executive orders is optimal?

"Despite your source, it is true that the top marginal tax rates dropped significantly under Reagan. That is part of the reason why the national debt grew rapidly when he was President: revenue was starved from the budget. "
"Spending also increased quite a bit under Reagan. He openly admitted that(as one of his biggest regrets). [Try this source](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/jun/25/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-says-reagan-raised-taxes-during/). Yes, he raised taxes multiple times, but: &gt; So it?s accurate to say Reagan increased levies during five years of his administration, but there?s a caveat: The overall tax burden on businesses and individuals went down during his presidency. Some of the increases were modest in scope. And it?s important to note that overall U.S. taxes, when measured as a portion of the nation?s GDP, went down during Reagan?s presidency. Overall, taxes went **down** under Reagan. I realize this doesnt mesh with /r/politics view of Reagan, but its the **truth**."
"This is why we should be able to insult people on /r/politics. You obviously didnt even read my comment. I happened to *agree* with you that overall taxation went down under Reagan: &gt;it is true that the top marginal tax rates dropped significantly under Reagan And once again, Ill remind you that this is one of the main reasons why the national debt ballooned under Ronald Raygun. Of course, fiscal conservatives have been all about borrow and spend since then."

"Im so disappointed. When I first read the title I thought it said that Obama Has Kept His Promise... I clicked hastily thinking holy shit, he finally took a stand for something he promised. :("
Thanks for the link... Ive gone to politifact a few times but didnt know they had a promises section. I mean.. I guess it could be worse.. but it certainly isnt the hope and change that was implied. And I still think he ended up being much more of the same. But I think the major issue is the system is broken; Im not sure any president could really make the changes necessary.

Id rather them not legislate. Thats when stupid stuff happens.
As soon as we started to circumvent the Constitution and we went away from sound money our Republic was no longer a Republic.
"Money:Politicians Steroids:Athletes In order to win, they need it. No room for the honest man anymore."
The cancer is lobbying.
"The bigger the government gets (the more it taxes people), the more impossible it is to prevent private interests from paying and lobbying to get their moneys worth. A government that costs 7% of GDP (1910s) and only acts as a common self defense against foreign and domestic initiators of force will be undesirable to control, but one which costs 40% of GDP (today) will inevitably attract the attention of its biggest victims, those who are paying $millions in taxes have millions of reasons to lobby and make sure they get a benefit for what they are forced to pay."
Stop voting for the two party system. That is all. Once a third party starts getting 10% of the vote things will change. Might meant a Republican Controlled Senate or House or President but hey are the Democrats really that different from Republicans(besides abortion) ?
"To be completely fair, legislators also campaign for the causes their donors support."
Public funding for campaigns.
"So shut up, find a candidate you like, and campaign for them for free. Otherwise NOTHING WILL CHANGE. You cant just write about being angry at the system. If its that bad, change it. Preferably by running yourself and doing all the work it takes to get elected without having massive fundraising. If you cant do that, find someone qualified who will do it, and be prepared to make thousands of phone calls, knock on doors for 6 hours a day, wave signs around, and generally put in about a part-time Jobs worth of effort, without getting paid a cent for it or reimbursed for anything. Oh. And convince a thousand other people to do the same in every city in the area electing your official."
"Im not sure why anyone is surprised by this. We, quite literally, have a system that elects whoever is the best at campaigning. Ill make a metaphor (allegory? Im never quite sure): Lets say that congress is actually a tech company. This company needs to hire a bunch of web designers for two-year contracts. Due to the nature of the job market when the company was founded (over two hundred and thirty years ago), the application process consists exclusively of a series of torch-juggling competitions. The problem, though, is that, once theyre hired, the torch-jugglers know that theyre going to have to re-apply for their job in two years, so instead of working on websites for you, they spend all of their time practicing torch-juggling. Well, thats easy! Just fire them! you might say. Unfortunately, this companys contracts are written in a way that makes this so difficult that in over two hundred years, only ONE employee has ever been fired from this company. Now, all is not lost! These web designers can only work for a set number of contracts in their lifetime, after which, they can no longer apply. Surely, theyd get some web design done during that last contract, right? Since they know they dont need to torch juggle ever again? Weeell, they actually just spend all of their last contract helping their friends and family learn to torch juggle, so THEY can get cushy web design jobs. **tl;dr: If you set up a system where people compete for a job thats entirely unrelated to the competition itself, youre going to end up with people that are good at the competition, not the job.** "
Democracy: People choose their representatives. Representatives write the laws What we have: Representatives choose the voters. Corporations write the laws.
There is a plan to fix this: http://www.wolf-pac.com/the_plan
[Great talk on the subject by Lawrence Lessig](http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim.html).
"If you wish to keep slaves, you must have all kinds of guards. The cheapest way to have guards is to have the slaves pay taxes to finance their own guards. To fool the slaves, you tell them that they are not slaves and that they have Freedom. You tell them they need Law and Order to protect them against bad slaves. Then you tell them to elect a Government. Give them Freedom to vote and they will vote for their own guards and pay their salary. They will then believe they are Free persons. Then give them money to earn, count and spend and they will be too busy to notice the slavery they are in. --Alexander Warbucks "
Thats why we need to get money out of politics. Wolf-PAC.com
Screw raising your kids to contribute to society!!! Raise them to be lobbyists!!! Cha Ching!!!
"Translation: Ok, yes, conservatives are tarred and sooty and in the name of false equivalencies, conservatives get to call Democratic black even if they are really gray. "
"What this program reveals is that American politics works exactly the same way that Advertising and Marketing does. The politicians are the Advertisers and Marketers. The interests that finance their campaigns are the clients. The voters (thats us) are the audience, and the audience is the product that Ad/M sells to their clients. Thats whats actually going on. The groups funding campaigns are buying the politicians services, which is to deliver policy directions to their favor; voters are the means by which this happens. This is not a dysfunctional system; this is Working As Intended. A system that was never meant to work for the people is not one that is broken. Instead, it is one committing fraud as a normal operating procedure; we, after all, have to keep believing that were the clients and not the product."
"How about you dumbfucks actually do something about it? Voting this shit up on reddit isnt going to accomplish anything. You have millions of you fuckers on this site and the best you can come up with is Lets upvote a link and voice our opinions. Thatll show the establishment Youre a fucking disgrace, Reddit. "
"Not only that, but democracy isnt feasible as long as people cant verify vote totals for themselves. We simply lack the technology (or arent using it if we do have it) to have a true democracy for any community too large for the average person to know the voters, or have some way to personally verify that the election was legit. On top of all of that, democracy isnt a good form of government, as its tyranny of the largest group of voters, which is almost never a majority. If it were possible to restrict what was voted on to say the confines of a Constitution that defended the rights of every individual, that would be one thing... but since thats impossible, there is no value to democracy as a form of government. Edit.. No value to people, but great value to tyrants who want to perpetuate the notion that the people have the government they want."
If all they did was raise money and never legislate then they would quickly run out of the ability to raise money. I know reddit likes to get up in arms about fat-cat donors but [more than a third of Obamas money comes from sub-$200 donors and less than half donate more than $1000.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/22/barack-obama/obama-campaign-financed-large-donors-too/) 
" A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the worlds greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years "
"Watch the documentary Park Avenue: Money, Power and the American Dream. It hits on this subject many times. You wouldnt believe how deeply routed the corruption is. The people you elect are not writing legislation. Theyre paying lobbyists to do that while they plan their next campaign. "
"The U.S. government has been completely privatized, and no longer functions as a representative republic. This is absolute truth. We are governed by whores. You can say that money has always been a feature of politics, but it hasnt always been the sole fucking purpose. Mr. Smith not only cant get to Washington anymore, he cant even get on the village council. Good luck getting any of these prostitutes to actually take any serious action against the system of bribery and extortion that has rendered our goverment a neo-feudalistic corporatocracy - of the lobby, by the lobby and for the lobby. "
Citizens United made money king.
" Politics is the business of getting re-elected. I have a young friend who just finished his first year in congress. He came in hoping to do good. Now he is just raising money. He has a pretty safe district, so I dont know why he felt the need. He has raised multiples of what his first election cost. Probably because from the inside, the methods are more efficient and the connections far better. For a politician, changing the rules would be foolish. You have a huge advantage over entry level politicians."
"Hyperbolic, short-sighted nonsense. While the past two Congresses have done practically nothing, the 11th Congress (2009-2010) was one of the most productive in our nations history. There are certainly problems with our campaign finance system, but it hasnt stopped Congress from legislating when it wants to. [Bloomberg News](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-22/no-congress-since-1960s-makes-most-laws-for-americans-as-111th.html): &gt; However history judges the 535 men and women in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate the past two years, one thing is certain: The 111th Congress made more law affecting more Americans since the ?Great Society? legislation of the 1960s. &gt; &gt; For the first time since President Theodore Roosevelt began the quest for a national health-care system more than 100 years ago, the Democrat-led House and Senate took the biggest step toward achieving that goal by giving 32 million Americans access to insurance. Congress rewrote the rules for Wall Street in the most comprehensive way since the Great Depression. It spent more than $1.67 trillion to revive an economy on the verge of a depression, including tax cuts for most Americans, jobs for more than 3 million, construction of roads and bridges and investment in alternative energy; ended an almost two-decade ban against openly gay men and women serving in the military, and today ratified a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia. [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/22/AR2010122205620.html): &gt; The House and Senate adjourned for the year on Wednesday evening, closing a two-year term that holds the odd distinction of being both historically busy and epically unpopular. &gt; &gt; A Congress that was dominated by Democrats passed more landmark legislation than any since the era of Lyndon B. Johnsons Great Society. [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/us/politics/23cong.html): &gt; The 111th Congress ended as it began two years ago, with a burst of legislative productivity, as Democrats forced through a historic social change by lifting the ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military and a major foreign policy achievement in approving the New Start arms control treaty with Russia. &gt; &gt; Along the way, they enacted a landmark health care law and a sweeping overhaul of Wall Street rules, bookended by a $787 billion economic stimulus package at the start of 2009 and an $858 billion tax-cut package at the end of 2010. &gt; &gt; It was a dizzying, maddening, agonizing, exhilarating, arduous, bruising and, for scores of Democrats, ultimately career-ending journey from the stimulus to Start ? and the party paid a devastating price for its accomplishments, losing control of the House and six Senate seats."
Politicians are the worst damned beggars and panhandlers out there. Theres a great deal of irony in that coming from the Republican party.
"This is a direct consequence of the administrative state. When the government has the power to regulate everything, then huge sums of money will be spent trying to influence the regulations for the benefit of some special interest. "
You know there was a presidential candidate that wasnt a whore. Who got the most money from the military and public. Too bad he was a crazy racist and believed in the constitution 
"Im always wary of the term special interests because I have a feeling those who are trying to obscure the difference between Big Oil and Planned Parenthood are the same people who are against hate crimes laws and special rights for gay people. People who dont like affirmative action usually are dead silent about subsidies for oil companies and they tend to love laws that make it possible for them to benefit from inherited wealth (rather than from merit or any hard work they personally did). I dont like that those who have poisoned the words bureaucrat (which now somehow only refers to government workers and doesnt include Congress members, conveniently), compromise, entitlement, and Washington are often the same ones complaining about the interest of special interest groups. Just sayin..."
I keep thinking the solution is simple: Publically-funded campaigns. Time focused on legislation instead of fundraising. No more lobbyist money flowing in. All candidates on equal financial footing. ...Can somebody show me how/where Im wrong in thinking this? 
"Special interests on both sides my ass. Until unions were crushed, they were the primary contributors to the Democratic party. Corporations and the wealthy had more money and contributed more to the Republicans, but because the Dems actually fought for working people, they generally won more elections. Thats why FDR was able to push through so many banking and Wall Street reforms, reforms that kept America free of banking crises for decades, until the Republicans got their way and repealed them. Since Ronald Reagan crushed the Air Traffic Controllers union, unions have declined to the point that they can no longer give enough money to Dems to compete. This has driven Dems to seek money from the same corporate sources as the Reps, which is why so many Dems no longer represent working people."
both sides lol
I am curious to know how much time is spent doing their jobs and how much time is spent begging for money. My guess is that begging is the thing that gets the most attention.
One of the most illustrative and educational programs Ive ever heard on this issue of political fundraising in modern American politics came from NPRs This American Life. http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office Listen at your own risk. You will be angry an disheartened when the hour is over.
"The only way it gets fixed is to reduce the Return on lobbying. This is the concept behind libertarianism. Lobbying Returns 22,000% http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/new-economy/2009/0410/why-do-firms-lobby-a-22000-percent-return"
"How the fuck are we, the minority of people, ever going to fix this? I say minority because most people *do not care*. Were getting totally screwed by the revolving door of politicians and lobbyists, students are getting fucked by loan profiteering, were all getting bent over by wall street (derivatives, commodities, etc?), everyone+businesses suffer under the current patent system, we all suffer supporting the military industrial and now the espionage markets. I mean, were pretty much fucked and not enough people care, so how hard is it to emigrate to Iceland?"
"I am sorry but complaining about special interests ruining our government is a fucking cop out when compared to the damage that the voting population has done by electing unqualified unreasonable and uncompromising elected officials to rule in our government with the purpose of setting a particular ideoloical agenda. Upset at Mansato or Halliburton or Exxon? Be upset instead at the individuals who got McConnel or Ted Cruz or the Pauls, or any number of people who do not legislate past what they were elected for, to be complete dicks"
We need to elect someone that really understands the constitution. Someone that maybe taught constitutional law at some point. And that person should be very familiar with the community so he can see how the constitution benefits the little people in the community. It would be helpful if that person had some experience organizing people in the community too. Im sure with a president like that we would have a much better functioning government.
"This used to be one of those things that both sides agreed on. Then these Koch/CATO libertarians started with their money=speech memes, creeping into the belief system of the conservative base.

"Quick note: The United States of America is not a democracy. The United States of America is a republic. The Constitution of the United States of America (ratified 1788), prior to the addition of the Bill of Rights (ratified 1791), is all about economics; the current Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation (ratified 1781) because under the AoC the federal government could not tax nor could it regulate commerce (interstate and international). Thus, the current Constitution was drafted to breakdown how the locus of power between States and all forms of government would function based on economic variables. As an example, the 3/5s compromise."

"I would like to correct the misunderstandings, mischaracterizations, and outright misinformation about *Citizens United*: (1). *Citizens United* did not declare corporations are people and thus have First Amendment rights. Even Lawrence Lessig rebuffs this bit of misinformation. What the Supreme Court held was that the First Amendment protects *speech* not *speakers* and that any regulation of speech (no matter the source) must meet strict scrutiny. Note: the term corporate personhood shows up once in the entire case: in Stevens dissent. (2). *Citizens United* does *not* allow for unlimited donations by corporations to candidates nor for corporations to give large sums of money. FEC limits on direct donations to campaigns are in the low four figures, period. *Citizens United* was about whether restricts on independent political advocacy met strict scrutiny, they did not. If someone would like to point to the part of Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech which allows for discrimination based on source, I am happy to hear it. (3). No, corporations cannot get around this by using Super PACs. A Super PAC is super because it can receive (and spend) an unlimited amount of money. What makes them super? They cannot donate to a candidate. One thin nickel and theyre back to being the same as any other PAC: the most anyone can donate is $5,000. (4). No, you dont have evidence corporations donate vast sums anyway. Dont link to that news article. All of those articles are going off of the Open Secrets website. But what Open Secrets admits (that the news article doesnt) is that [we standardize the name of the donors employer. If enough contributions came in from people connected with that same employer, the organizations name winds up on the Top Contributor list.](http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/include/contribmethod_pop.php) See also: [The organizations themselves did not donate , rather the money came from the organizations PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals immediate families.](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638). Its how Elizabeth Warren receives [$304,050 from Harvard University](http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;cid=N00033492&amp;newMem=Y&amp;type=I). The university didnt cut her a check. Those are donations from individual employees of Harvard. (5). There is no difference between what a PAC does and what Google did by going dark to protest SOPA. In both cases it is an attempt to *influence* voters by presenting an argument. You can argue that it distorts the political views of the American people, but Ive yet to see someone justify allowing Google, Wikipedia, Reddit, and the New York Times to do it, but not allowing Moveon.org to do it. (6). Correlation does not prove causation. Even if we accept that there is a distorting influence of this money, it does not indicate corruption. The explanation that a wealthy individual is donating to a PAC to help someone get elected so he can exert influence is no more likely (I would argue less likely) than the explanation that a wealthy individual donates to get someone *who already agrees with him* elected. (7). The entire argument against *Citizens United* (when it is properly understood) relies on a belief that the American people cannot be trusted with democracy. It relies on a belief that the American people are slavishly obedient to whatever advertisements tell them, and will do no amount of research, or much by way of thoughtful analysis, when told something. Justice Stevens argued as much in his dissent: If individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to and contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no special ability to influence elections apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they make any)... then I suppose the majority?s premise would be sound. Americans are *too busy* to be allowed to listen to speech and decide for themselves what to believe. When did believing the American people can be trusted become anti-democratic?"
"Nothing helps me process the news like hearing *Running on Empty* while shes making her point. Were they playing her off like at the Oscars, or do they think our attention spans are so short that we need music to stay interested?"
"What I found very useful is to apply some principles of the Evolution Theory to politics: Not the smartest and best win. Those who survive the longest win. And you dont survive because you have great ideas or concepts, but because you recieve funds that help you to keep advertising and hire a staff that keeps you relevant. And the most reliable way to recieve funds is, to be a bumlicker for the rich. And not just that, its also quite obviously so that the rich are much more influential in this society. They appear successful and influential, they can buy attention and have well-connected people around them in their sociotope. Ultimately that leads to a clear correlation between money and percieved credibility and reliability, as we do not expect people in expensive clothes and with good contacts to act like thugs. And of course it works in a similar way in the media... those who have ideas that diverge from the perception of the rich are considered irresponsible and ideological. This leads to scenarios where for example during the Nicaragua crisis Nicaragua was seen as the most problematic country in central America, even though it was the *only* country there at the time that did *not* massacre its own people, and even had successful social reform. But the government was socialist and the rich did not accept that, as that could have blocked their ways to rob and influence the country. If the measurement of problematic instead would have been things like social inequality and state murder, it would have been the *least* problematic country. Yet as Noam Chomsky found out, the mainstream press did, in of 80 researched opinions for example in the New York Times, not once question the fundamental necessity of an intrusion into Nicaraguan affairs, but rather limited all discussion on the tactical idea of how to do these intrusions. In other words, the press is highly ideological since a long time already, but we dont recognize it but rather agree with their ideas of what unacceptable opinions are. And then we wonder every few years how they could for example condemn Snowden so easily."

"?I do not believe that the solution to our problem is simply to elect the right people. The important thing is to establish a political climate of opinion which will make it politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right thing. Unless it is politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right thing, the right people will not do the right thing either, or, if they try, they will shortly be out of office.? - Milton Friedman"
"Many states already have the best senators and representatives you are likely to get. Oregons congressional delegation certainly doesnt meet your description, and our country would be ill-served by replacing the members of our delegation. Senator Wyden has worked tirelessly to draft legislation, to build consensus, to make this nation a better place. He has served as a role model for our junior senator, Jeff Merkley, and both now host town hall meetings in each and every county in the state, every year. Who would you suggest replacing these legislators with? The simple fact of the matter is, the problem is not *all* politicians, but merely a majority of them. There are still plenty of good, relatively honest politicians who work earnestly to legislate on behalf of the American people."

Of course less money in politics would be great and defineatly improve a lot, but it is not the sole reason for election outcomes.

I like how they started in with the sign-off music the moment they realized she was shitting on their sponsors.
"I understand that congress makes the laws so this will never change but we really need to get personal interests out of politics, at least at the federal level (i.e., lets start there). There are no special interests, you just donate to the DNC or the RNC or your choice of alternatives. All candidates get a web page. All candidates have the same television ad showing their viewpoints. All candidates get money to travel to reach their base. And nobody can use their own money. This puts every candidate at the same playing field where their views are all that is relevant. It wouldnt be that hard to implement and wed be *so much* better off. This is my second biggest gripe about being american after for-profit healthcare. "

"Duh, quite a few of us have said this for years, most were called crazy or right wing/left wing nutbags. "
"The problem with money and politics was exacerbated when the Supreme Court decided that money was speech, and therefore anyone should be able to give to a politician in any amount. Once that happened, the floodgates opened and *We The People* became non-existent to money grubbing politicians. Do I think it is going to be reversed, and the floodgates closed? Hell no. The politicos have the taste of nearly unlimited funds now, we will never have a functioning government again."
I was recently called by a politician that is running in Bostons mayoral race for a $250 donation. Hes currently a Boston city councilor. Im assuming that hes on the phone making calls like that all day long and not getting much work done. I blame the system.

"This is actually an easy problem to fix: the average congressional district has 600,000 people in it. Assume half of those even vote (300,000). Of those people, a third may be Democrat, a third Republican and a third independent. If those 100,000 each kick in $10-50 every two years (ie, donate to their candidate) - then the candidate wont need to take *any* special interest money at all. Contributing to campaigns needs to be seen as a mainstream, not an extremist, activity. Everyone should contribute to campaigns. This would solve the money in politics problem overnight. "
No. The insane and uninformed billionaire is always a republican. So there is a big difference. 
Saving for later. 
"That is all great, we all know that...how the fuck do we fix it?"
this is the question: how do you stop money from doing what money does?
So what do we do to change this?
keeping them busy is a way of getting an agenda passed without any oversight
"I dont understand how term limits isnt everyones 1st and last question for this permanent ruling class. IMO most go in with genuine good intentions, but the system wears them down. They do not know how to do anything else, so they sell their soul to stay - thus our problem. Over 75% of the population thinks limits are a good idea, yet nobody ever asks if they are in favor. Why?"
Representative democracy is always going to be like this. I am not naive enough to think direct democracy would be any better. 
with special interests on both sides... Youre still addicted to phony partisanship... i.e. one political party is significantly better/different than the other. they are not. when it comes to the money game/terminal campaigning (to raise money) theres _NO_ difference between the two political parties. 
There is a way out of this. Lawrence Lessig outlines that way out here: http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim.html
"If this current bunch of legislators are not voted out and run out of town, this country is fucked. The next step would be put shutters on the lobbyists offices. "
This title could not more be more truthful of both parties.
Our leaders have to take money from AIPAC and toe the line lest AIPACs fellows in Media destroy them. 
"Its true..they spend 80-90 percent of their time campaning for money for their reelection to do next to nothing for the people. They literaly walk across the street from their capital building and sit in cubicals. This is why you have citizens united...big companies wanted a way to influence their government with large contributions, perpetuating the ugly."
How is it even possible to fix this and make our government functional and accountable?
"Its more realistic to say they spend 1/2-3/4 of their time raising money, depending on the particular Congressman and their position/seniority/committee assignments but yes, even 1/2 is far too much. Maybe we can just get out a whip and yell Mush! Legislate faster damnit!"
"So...while I think we can all agree that public fundraising **needs** to happen in a functional democracy...what the hell are we gonna do about the ensuing situation where all the special interests just threaten to blackmail and character-assassinate by other means instead? Oh yeah, and Congressional term limits. Thats a thing. With hard money out of politics, incumbency will matter *even more.*"
"This is only effective because this is what you sheep vote for. If you didnt vote for it, it wouldnt be effective."
"terms limits. . Its not the final answer, but its the first step."
Looked like Karl Rove sitting there. If so that is hilarious
Which both sides?
step one is to get a media that is for the people and not for ratings...a media that will question and treat all politicians like the scumbags they are..
The Tea Party really is the novelty sign of the end. My history teacher in the 1990s would have said we are all finished if he heard that the next political party in America has a joke for a name.

"Normally when I give money for something, I expect that SOMETHING actually come back my way. Even if its simply karma (not the reddit kind but it doesnt hurt) "
What if we made campaigning illegal?
Now we know.....and we do nothing.
"It should come as no surprise that the last Presidential election ended less than a year ago, and the 2016 campaign has already begun. "
"Shit, a reputable person is speaking truths about the corruption in government. Quick, queue the 1980s cowboy music. "
why is it they sound like they are just realizing this now?
"A truer description has not been uttered to describe the way that corrupt campaigns, lobbying and plain old fashion *ol boys network* politics have shaped the modern political scene. Every part of government is beholden to this-or-that lobby and decisions are made based purely on their guidance. "
Ive got an idea! Lets raise more awareness! Surely that will ameliorate the issue!
"If government didnt get involved in the private sector in the first place, thus allowing such lobbying to even exist, wouldnt the market essentially regulate itself anyway?"
KFC is now a tax exempt not for profit business. Thanks Obama.
Really is our own fault. We wont vote someone into office unless they are campaigning constantly. 
So take action. Campaign and vote for third parties next time and make some changes!
Gotta love how the holy crap we need to take a break NOW music starts playing right as she gets into this.
"well, should they be legislating either?"
Herp + Derp = people who didnt know this already
The easiest solution is to pass a law making it illegal to do any kind of fundraising except in say the month of August. 
"Best way in my honest opinion to get rid of special interests; rewrite the tax code. Make it so everyone pays the same percentage of money across the board, no cuts or tax breaks. Companies pay a different level of course, but this would likely end most lobbying efforts and prevent special interest from controlling most of the government. Just an idea but it could change a ton I believe."
Legislators get paid to beg for more money and get on their knees to whoever has the fattest wallet. That is how I see them.
Any respectable redditors want to run for office? 
"How many on this thread understand that the: both sides are bad/the same is a conservative talking point with a purpose. It is costly to maintain the idea war, They want everyone in the same tent it will save them money and help keep their ugliest plans hidden.

Self interest groups would be more apt.

What If I told you that we are not a democracy. Doesnt change much but still. Get the terminology correct. 
Consider that political parties are special interest groups openly hiding behind the guise of government. Mind blown
"Its almost as if a democratic government is comprised of disparate, regional interests which are beholden to the wants and needs of a small plot of land within the whole. Newsflash: Thats how democracy works. Democracy is neither a quick nor a competent form of government. It is a *representative* form of government. Maybe everyones been mind-fucked into thinking democracy is supposed to be agreeable, but it absolutely is not. *Autocracy* is great at legislating. *Democracy* is great at preventing legislation. Thats the entire fucking point of it. Are you motherfuckers going to say politicians *shouldnt* constantly have their asses riding on public opinion?"
Going back to this later
The best democracy that money can buy. 
I dont know much about politics but Im studying to be an urban planner and I will try my hardest to put your tax dollars to good use and make a better city for tomorrow. 
Still better then most of the world.
"Ive always thought outlawing political TV ads would help greatly. Its the deceptive and voluminous ads that give money most of its power to elect officials. Its the combination of visual images, music, and scripting that give these ads the power to elect. Its where most of the money goes, and for a good reason. Its effective. Most people arent going to take the time to read an ad thats deceptive or many ads in a repetitive nature. Print media just doesnt have the same influence. Trying to argue a corporation isnt an individual is futile now, but passing legislation that deceptive ads or ads in general are not conducive to civic responsibilities is probably easier at this point. Let em spend all the money they want, but the thing that has the best results for the money spent wont be available anymore. "
No waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay?!?!?!
"She is wrong though. They dont **have** to spend all their time raising money and campaigning for office. They **choose** to do that -- because they WANT to stay in office (and pursue politics as a career). The problem isnt really just money, it is that politics has become a life-long CAREER, rather than a form of (temporary) public service. Not to mention that the majority of the money that politicians raise... ends up being pay TO THE MEDIA (which profiteers from it, and which ironically enough is a big part of what pays Ms Stahl her ridiculously oversized salary as a political reporter). So when it comes right down to it, the media -- including Ms Leslie Stahl herself -- are at least as much to blame for the problems with the system as anyone else."
"Stop all this fucking shit. The news is so biased it makes me sick. This post is one quote. Zero warrants. Over three thousand upvotes. You all make me want to throw up. Ive heard from a friend who was IN DC and watched congress for months exactly what its like. They FUCKING WORK. WHAT A GOD DAMN NOVEL CONCEPT. There is truth behind the cries of corruption, but for fucks sake realize we dont live in the shitstorm you all believe we do. If things were actually as bad as you all think they are then this country would have collapsed long ago. If you want this system to work stop fucking bitching and GET INVOLVED. "
Half way through they turn the music on. Holly shit shes making really valid a point! Quick lets get to a commercial before the viewers can digest what she just said. 
"Late to the party, so Ill just leave this here... [The Alternative Vote Explained](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE)"
"I know people are not going to want to hear this, but I have to say it so at least some of you understand. Incumbents have an advantage for several reasons outside of campaign finance. There are several statistics that you can search for on the web that show this. Campaign finance is the only realistic way to unseat an incumbent. Campaign finance reform that is restrictive in certain ways would tie the hands of those who would oppose an incumbent. We do need reform but just as they would never give themselves a pay cut and they would never give themselves a term limit, they are not going to make campaign finance reform that makes it easy for them to be unseated, you are basically asking them to self regulate, so be careful what you wish for you might not like the results. "
I cant believe they queued up the music in the middle of her speech on the video. How disrespectful. Even our media is broken. 
"I believe the only solution for hindering special interest groups etc. on both sides is the utilization of modern online platforms, which can endorse huge social movements and possibly even kickstarter type funding. Politicians and special interest groups do eventually react on massive social movements especially if money is involved. The only problem is that there are very few socially oriented online voting/influencing system. One example, which focuses solely on environmental influencing is http://www.ekofy.com, but is unfortunately not very popular in the moment."
Well one of groups have a plan called NO.

Great summary of politics today
This is the #1 problem in America right now. Harvard Prof. Lawrence Lessig is doing his best to try to offset the influence of special interests through campaign finance reform. His org is [rootstrikers](http://rootstrikers.org) Please take a moment to get informed on this issue.
"Partially true, however that was much too simplified for me to agree with its substance. I will say that moneyed interests hold too much sway in our political system. One of the major issues that people/ commentators fail to identify is with the lack of party cohesion. Which essentially hold no power in the political process, therefore our politicians are beholden to their electorate, and moneyed interests. Or more simply, if there are 100 republicans across the country, they are bound by their voters to push for their idea of policy...however politicians in different regions have different agendas. What once gave parties enforcement powers over their members was removed in the 1970s . So even though there are two parties, they exist in a nominal way only, and politicians have become what are called individual enterprises... No party cohesion = no policy cohesion, which ultimately leads to no policies getting made and most importantly NO ACCOUNTABILITY to voters on a national level."
"Third parties cannot win because information is controlled by money and the money flows through the two parties. If we could somehow fund a third party at a level comparable to the Dems and Repubs, they could win, but would have the same weaknesses that the Dems and Repubs have now (unresponsiveness to the needs of average citizens/over responsiveness to compaign contributors). Furthermore, (I am less sure about this argument) the third party argument is a bit naive. Government is an incredibly complex machine and only the parties really know how it works. A third party President would lack vital insider connections needed to get things done. The best option is to force the parties to change. Americans need to demand better. Increased intra-party turnover as punishment for campaign-trail lies will force the parties to de-homogenize and respond to the public will. History shows how far the parties can change when the public stops believing their bullshit. Only if the parties did not change in response to broad public disapproval could a third party conceivably be successful. And the American public is nowhere close to broadly disapproving."
"Really good points, but Im not sure what your proposed solution is. We are absolutely stuck voting for the lesser of two evils, and the Democrats are absolutely that vote. As voters, what we can do is cause high turnover in the Democratic party. Always vote Democrat, but if that Democrat is a wolf in sheeps clothing, vote them out in the next primary. We have seen how horrible revolution is, so we must change things from within the system, and that requires voter awareness. I do not know how to raise voter awareness though."
"&gt;We are absolutely stuck voting for the lesser of two evils Why? You engage in irrational, circular reasoning (we cant vote for third parties because they cant win because we dont vote for them) in 3... 2... 1..."
"I come from the other side of the spectrum, but have gained disdain for both parties completely. I will not just vote the lesser of 2 evils any longer, I would like to see a clean sweep of the house in 2014 and will not vote again for my congressman (Duncan Hunter Jr. CA-52). Folks on both sides need to understand the system is completely corrupted and we need to start over. I changed to decline to state registration in California (Independent) and will not every register Republican or Democrat again. I was a registered Democrat in my youth, got burnt out on their BS, and then Republican same thing. Screw them all it has been 1639 days since a budget was passed in the US, they are their to work for us and need to learn to work together. I also think they need to stay in their districts most of the time and use things like Skype, Facetime."
"I live in a blue state, where theres really no chance of red.. To show blue how I feel, I frequently vote green when given the option. "
"Do what the GOP crazies do, start challenging the Dems supporting FISA and NSA in the primaries. You dont even have to have a good candidate. You could run your dog and that makes your rep spend money running ads and mobilize support for the primaries. In states with open primaries the GOP would rally to support the weaker candidate, which would make it a race even if your primary challenger is grossly under qualified. A couple primary challenges send a clearer message than all the emails you could ever send. "
The problem is candidates can say whatever they want when running (they can lie). So we have to give them a chance and then have the awareness to know when they are liars and punish them for it.
"I might be right or wrong, but as I see it there are problems with both parties. I refuse to vote for any candidate, regardless of party, whos ideas and values I disagree with. Mitt Romney was so pro-business its sickening. Corporations get enough tax breaks in this country - to the tune of billions of dollars a year and a first-class seat at the head of government. Corporate tax breaks, by and large, need to go away. Secondly, corporate political spending need to be outlawed. Obama is just a liar, plain and simple. Out of all the campaign promises he made, 48% were either stalled, compromised or broken outright. [Link](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/). Not only that, but hes continued and even expanded many of the domestic spying programs enacted under his predecessor, then lied about what they do - to the *public on national TV* [Link](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/08/07/obama_we_dont_have_a_domestic_spying_program.html). Even more egregious, he blames their continued presence on Bush? Hes been in office long enough now to change them. Instead he shift blame? Thats not Hope and Change, Thats Its not my fault. His campaign advisers got it right. The Hope and Change mantra of his campaigns were happily swallowed by the people because *thats what we really want - CHANGE*. Instead we got another politician, content to keep the status quo, raises taxes fruitlessly while stripping the pockets of the middle class to pay for expanded programs no one wants - or worse, dont know exist. The only thing Obama is really good at is giving speeches. There are platforms in both parties that I vehemently disagree with. I disagree with expanded government that forces me to pay more and more and get nothing of value in return. Obamacare is a disaster waiting to happen, regardless of all the things liberals point to that will be fixed under it, such as denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. Frankly, it doesnt go far enough to fix the underlying problems with our Healthcare system. I disagree with giving unfair tax breaks and economic benefits to businesses just because they line the politicians pockets with gold every election. While its undeniable that it save these companies money, the fact is these savings are not doing anything to improve the economy - instead this wealth is being amassed and sheltered in tax havens, giving CEOs and other board member the capability of having Golden Parachutes and other insulators that protect them against failure, while the rest of the workforce suffers."
That must be why President Obama has spent more than all other previous presidents COMBINED.

It was passed before it was even understood what would happen. Pelosi said it herself."

The ACA was always going to need fixing. It was a turd sandwich designed by conservatives to mimic auto insurance mandates as its selling point. Larger risk pools mean lower premiums. Which is why my auto insurance costs more per month than my health insurance right now even with a clean driving record. :/

Never mind the multiple interviews by people who knew him in the past and in school by the name Barry Soetoro, countless web pages, news articles, and other documents listing him as Barry, as foreign born, as a recipient for foreign aid, a Kenyan, etc. Lets face it, people who dont find this questionable at least are the ones who are truly ignorant."

All of the Occidental alumni I have spoken to from that era (1979-81) who knew him, knew him as Barry Obama. Having a nickname is not evidence of fraud. Most people have them at some point.

"He eliminated a *federal requirement* put in place by Bill Clinton. As a result, the food stamps program more than doubled in the past five years. If there was to be a change... it should have been done through legislation. Like the legislation that Clinton signed instituting the work requirement. "
One qualified if one was also doing 20 hours of community service. You know how to improve your chances of getting a job? Enroll in a job training class. Boom! You qualify for aid. And when you go back into the workforce you will likely GET a BETTER job. 
&gt;Obama eliminated that requirement. He agreed to leave more of that to the states...as he was asked to. http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/does-obamas-plan-gut-welfare-reform/
No. The GOP governors were not demanding that he relax the rules for SNAP. Once the rules were relaxed the SNAP rolls *doubled.* Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? How was it ok for a president to unilaterally decide that part of the law was null and void? GOP governors did NOT want to get rid of the work/service requirement for receiving SNAP. Now...Democrat governors.... See the citations. 
&gt; Bill Clinton was the one who introduced legislation saying that the able-bodied needed to try to find work or to be in a job training program in order to get food stamps. And it worked when unemployment was a whopping 3% and there were 3 jobs for every applicant.
"&gt;Bill Clinton was the one who introduced legislation saying that the able-bodied needed to try to find work or to be in a job training program in order to get food stamps. Incorrect. The legislation was introduced by Rep. E. Clay Shaw, Jr. (R-FL-22) and was a cornerstone of the republican Contract with America. &gt;Obama eliminated that requirement. Nowhere does the opinion piece you linked to mention Obama or what specific rules he changed. &gt;Veterans CAN use the GI Bill to enroll themselves in a job training program and get food stamps. If they qualify. "
"Im not overlooking anything. Your submission is based on a Romney commercial. Im not arguing the points in the Romney commercial...from your link: &gt;Ron Haskins, a former Republican House committee aide who was instrumental in the 1996 overhaul of the welfare program, told us the Obama administration should not have unilaterally changed the work-requirement rules.

"Conservative objection to the Sandy Aid bill was to the pork in it. It contained substantial money for things that had nothing to do with Sandy Aid. Those conservatives are trustworthy. Christie isnt really a conservative and, for many of us, the moment he excoriated the GOP for holding up a pork-laden bill was the moment we decided he was not president material. He should have told both parties to take the pork out of the bill and THEN pass it."
"Youll forgive me if I dont recall discussing this with you. Maybe you could point me to that thread. The issue with the relief bill was the principle. THAT is what conservatives objected to. It doesnt matter what sort of pork was in it, conservatives objected (and Im talking about every day conservatives) to spending that was NOT something brought about by Sandy. There was money for Alaskan fisheries put in that bill. There was substantial spending that had nothing to do with Sandy. Thats what conservatives objected to. It was a behemoth spending bill. "
"I thank you for your effort...but its in vain. This thread is a perfect example of why conservatives dont care to post on /r/politics.

I have to wait 9 minutes between posts even when liberals here are rapid firing questions at me. The comment you responded to isnt even controversial. Its documented fact. When Chris Christie poo pood Republican efforts to get pork out of the bill and demanded that it be passed with the pork in it, he lost a lot of fiscal conservatives.

"I remember having this conversation with you a few months ago. You cited things like damage to the Smithsonian in DC, and Amtrack. All of the things you mentioned were significantly affected by Sandy, and would have had a greater impact on the economy if not fixed--for example, the Smithsonians 30 million visitors brings huge economic activity from other countries, and was easily worth the several million spent on repairs. You stopped responding when everyone realized you felt it was pork because it wasnt important to you."

"&gt; if obama was for it, we had to be against it Source? Im sorry...but NO. Someone saying something happened in a private meeting is NOT legitimate.

I heard that in a closed-door meeting...really, I did. Im writing a book about it. Do you understand me? Obama dictated some policy he wanted that the GOP was necessarily going to oppose, because their voters oppose it. And the Senate is sitting on over 200 bills passed by the House...why? To say one side is just unreasonably obstructionist...and the other side doesnt obstruct is wrong. And the top comment here is not sourced by ANYTHING legitimate. Obama IS a partisan.

"The man who wrote the article and book is a credible reporter and there is no reason to not believe him, unless you just dont want to. Hes not just *some guy*. Senator Voinovich on record, tells the author, ?If he was for it, we had to be against it,? Voinovich tells Grunwald. And at another point, characterizing a strategy session Republicans and McConnell had held in early January of 2009, Voinovich said: ?He wanted everyone to hold the fort. All he cared about was making sure Obama could never have a clean victory.? A Republican aide sheds some more light on McConnell?s strategizing just after the 2008 election. Page 148: ?People were pretty demoralized, and there were two totally opposite thoughts on how to approach the situation,? a McConnell aide recalls. ?One was, we dont like the president, we ought to pop him early. The other was, he?s really popular, we should work with him, because that?s what people want us to do. The boss?s take was: Neither. McConnell realized that it would be much easier to fight Obama if Republicans first made a public show of wanting to work with him. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/biden-mcconnell-decided-to-withhold-all-cooperation-even-before-we-took-office/2012/08/10/64e9a138-e302-11e1-98e7-89d659f9c106_blog.html This is pretty old news, and surely if it was even remotely false, these are very heavy accusations that would be justification for a lawsuit. Of course, it does seem to corroborate pretty well with all their actions since Obama was elected. Both times. [Heres an interesting video from old Mitchy-boy](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/10/1118614/-Biden-Mitch-McConnell-vowed-no-cooperation-with-the-Obama-administration-from-the-get-go#) Our top political priority over the next two years should be to deny President Obama a second term. Republican obstructionism under Obama is unprecedented. It just is. Unless you havent been paying attention to politics the last 5 years, or only been listening to right wing media, it is obvious. Just like climate change, you cant deny reality or twist the facts. There is chart after chart after chart showing the numbers in almost every way you can measure it to demonstrate how far Republicans have gone to obstruct Obama. Some key words that you may have heard over the past couple years: Supermajority, cloture, filibuster, nominees, shutdown, compromise, repeal Obamacare, debt ceiling, etc... http://crooksandliars.com/jon-perr/republicans-unprecedented-obstructionism-by-numbers http://www.nationalmemo.com/5-ways-the-gops-obstruction-is-unprecedented/ http://www.epi.org/blog/congressional-republicans-smothered-rapid-economic-recovery/ http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/05/03/happy-hour-roundup-new-report-confirms-gop-obstructionism-is-unprecedented/ The false equivalency wont work either. You can compare the numbers, ask a historian, or heck, even read yourself about politics when the places are reversed. Yes, when Bush was in office and Democrats controlled the Senate, the indexes spiked, but not even close to the extent that Republicans have on everything from filibusters to blocking judicial nominees. Resistance and obstructionist are two different things. The term you might use to describe it would be, Unprecedented. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/04/obama-says-gop-obstructionism-of-nominations-is-unprecedented-what-if-hes-right/ http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_12/unprecedented_obstruction_and033982.php The link you provided stating Obama is the most liberal Senator (only in 2007 by the way, according to your link), is false. Or at least, **mostly false**. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/several-ratings-rank-obama-lower/ I hear this one a lot about the Democrats shutting down the government 7 times. Have you actually read what they were about, how long they lasted, and what impact they had? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_shutdown_in_the_United_States And in more depth, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/25/here-is-every-previous-government-shutdown-why-they-happened-and-how-they-ended/ http://www.policymic.com/articles/65917/history-of-government-shutdowns-everything-you-need-to-know 14 days total, most being weekends, lessening the little impact they had. Some for innocuous reasons, like the scheduling of the Presidents White House Barbeque. Not to the extent and over such hard-lined ideological issues we have had since Gingrichs shutdowns. In fact, ironically, since the impact was so little on everyone politically and practically, including the public, shutdowns were more common. It wasnt really until Republicans under Clinton really raised the stakes of what a shutdown could be. 26 days, over overtly ideological issues. Seems kind of different, if you ask me. Look at just ONE of your talking points, Dems shut down govt 7 times under Reagan! One simple sentence, the implication being, Oh, so it is normal. Or, Dems are just being hypocrites. Or, Dems do it also, so its fine if Republicans do it. It takes *so* much explaining just to get people to understand and undo all the coded language in that one brilliantly crafted talking point. You have to read exactly what the shutdowns were about, what impacts did they have, what was Washington culture like 30 years ago, how were they resolved and why? And even then, you still might not have a clear reconciliation about the ramifications put forth in that one little claim. Youre right, we can disagree about solutions to things. Some are better, some are worse, some are both right, but we disagree on the unintended consequences of those solutions. But because Republicans consistently abandon facts and devolve to rhetoric and emotion (and outright lying) to win the popular opinion, it is almost impossible to have a real conversation about policies. I would love for politics to be about science and math and philosophy, but unfortunately there is the whole meta game of politics, which is not about coming up with the best solution, but convincing people you are better than your opponent. And even more unfortunately, there is little repercussion for distortion to achieve that goal."

"Some of these graphs are optically misleading. Particularly the America is unusually violent which excludes nations that outpace us that would normally be listed under OECD, not to mention make it look like there is more of a gap than there actually is between 2 deaths per 100,000 and 5 deaths per 100,000. Granted a 150% increase is significant but its scaled in a way that exaggerates it. Same with the Gas Guzzlers, notice that the Axis starts at 10% making America appear 400% over other nations instead of the admittedly not so great 80%ish."

"USA is great in principle, and on TV. "
"A large amount of the data is skewed to cast the US in an unfavorable light. The use of graphs has always and will always do this. Graphs such as this are always misleading at first glance due to the fact that the information used to create them are not clearly stated with the graph; and the references, in the case of these statistics, are somewhat shady. These also look at national laws, and do not take into account any state laws that the US has or social norms in the US; which has a huge affect on most of the data in the graphs. Take for example the violence statistics. It takes into account the nations in the OECD that the US is above. Leaving out Estonia and Mexico, which are greatly ahead of the US in violence. Turkey is also not included, due to the fact that the information could not reliably be obtained. Other problems in this set of data is the way in which the national statistics are reported; that being in a reliable way. When looking at the surveillance data it shows that most of the faults it lists are the lack of laws preventing government intrusion, REAL-ID, and border surveillance. The greatest factor seaming the be the fact that the US Constitution has no law granting a right to privacy other than the Fourth Amendment. Also making this graph somewhat misleading. While there is no national paid maternity leave there is the Family and Medical Leave act, which provides up to 12 weeks unpaid leave; with paid leave being up the the discretion of the employer. California and New Jersey have state legislation that provides paid Family Leave insurance. However this is provided through payroll tax to the employees; imposing no cost to employers. In regards to vacation time, it only accounts for national laws providing vacation and does not take into account any state laws. Also a recent study done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2011 found that over 90% of all full-time private sector jobs, and 40% of all part-time private sector jobs, provided paid vacation time. This also takes into account that these are based on full-time jobs. The gas guzzler graph also doesnt take into account the amount of public transportation, amount of population in rural areas, or the number of cars per capita; only global emissions per capita. The women in government statistic shows no reference other than World Data Bank and as such holds no validity in my opinion. Does it take into account local and state government or is it only federal government? Im not going to go searching for some random information that i may not find to verify this. **TL;DR**: these graphs are incredibly biased and pretty much shit."
"Freedom is not a synonym for having all the good things. Id argue many of those things are not related to freedom, though are certainly good to have."
The reason the US is so low is that Americans on average prefer non-interventionalist policies. Many dont like the idea of employer regulation from the government on things like vacation days and maternity leave. The top countries on these lists are socialist nations- high taxes allow the government to give larger amounts of aid in health care and social welfare. Now if one system is better than the other? That depends on a persons political beliefs and your definition of what freedom is.

"As an Engineer (who works with engines and emissions regulations) I can tell you that the Emissions graph on CO2 emissions is definitely misleading. US On-highway regulations are not very focused on CO2 emissions, and are more focused on NOx, CO, and particulate matter. In fact, as far as I know (and I could be wrong as I work exclusively with diesels) the US Government doesnt even regulate CO2 emissions in cars! I will attest that CO2 emissions are directly related to consumption of fuel, but the two issues I have with this graph are that: 1) It doesnt specify what is included, who is included, anything other than listing these numbers. This may or may not include Semis, other work trucks, military, all of which could have a huge effect on the numbers. 2) The main reason for this differential, at least in my opinion, is the fact that due to higher taxes and gas prices in other countries, the US often doesnt get vehicles which get much higher mpg! We hardly get any diesel models, not very many smaller more fuel efficient cars, and while it could very well be that the market here wont support those models, I still feel like it needs to be mentioned as a cause for this difference in CO2 emissions /rant"

Many things in the 20th century can trace their roots to the European solution to WW1 and the Treaty of Versailles, Vietnam, ww2 (and all the baggage that goes with it), the cold war, many problems in the middle east.

"Theres one major caveat that isnt disclosed in the last graph about womens participation in government: Many of the countries, such as Rwanda and Argentina, *mandate* minimal levels of female representation or list placement through political gender quotas (essentially taking away voters absolute discretion to choose in exchange for greater diversity, which raises other ethical quandaries). This would arguably be unconstitutional in the US, and even if it werent, the USs winner-takes-all system of voting would make such a mandate impossible to implement. So theres little, from an institutional standpoint, that the US can do to affirmatively increase representation. You would have to change voters prejudices toward female public officials in order to get effective change, or have an already male-dominated Congress amend the Constitution. Source: I wrote a lot about this as part of my comparative law studies in law school."

"This is why I consider leaving the states more and more, our country is just utter shit when compared to how good we *could* be."
"Yeah Id have to agree with a lot of the comments here about America. I mean, it really just isnt cool to like living in America and being proud of your country. This is especially true because it makes no sense to love your country but dislike your government because theyre doing a poor job. Government is all there is when it comes to how to perceive a country, not physical landscape and culture. "
I find it funny that people are always trying to show how the U.S. is overrated by comparing it to countries that arent even comparable.

If you dont like America then you can giiiiiiit out. 
AMMMMMEERRRICA IS STILLL THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLLLD!
So much crying.
if you dont like america then leave?
"To be fair, violent crime in America has been on the decline for the past several decades, though ironically enough, prison populations have skyrocketed. I would assume that both violent crime and prison populations would be drastically lower if it were not for the Drug War. And then theres the accusation that we spend too much on healthcare. While admittedly this is a major problem, the automatic solution should not be socialized medicine. There are plenty of changes we can make to our current system that would drastically decrease healthcare costs. For example, lets get rid of the restriction against buying health insurance across state lines. This simply makes no sense. Why should healthcare be confined to the state you live in? If theres a more affordable plan in another state, why should you be prevented from purchasing it? What happens when you move? Do you lose your health insurance? Do you have to buy another insurance plan? This make no sense! Just allow people to buy whatever insurance they want wherever it is. This will increase competition among companies and help drive down costs. And thats just one way of fixing our healthcare system without spending a dime: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhJ73JuWJY (And before anyone says that we need to go national because other countries have socialized national healthcare systems, both Switzerland and Singapore provide universal healthcare WITHOUT a socialized national healthcare system: http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/the-myth-of-the-free-market-american-health-care-system/254210/ So why not emulate them?) As for women in government, while it would be ideal to have more diversity in our government, pragmatically, it should not be our main concern. We ought to be focusing on what our politicians stand for, not what dangles between their legs. It would be nice to have a female president, but think about the recent women whove tried to run for president. Would we really want someone like Sarah Palin or Michelle Bachmann or Hilary Clinton running the country? Seeing as how most of these women would run the country into the ground, Im guessing most of you wouldnt. More female politicians would be nice, but competent female politicians would be nicer. Think quality, not quantity."
"I think real freedom emerges from a society of people caring for each other and a state that provides good social standards to everyone. If freedom is defined by drastic economic individualism and coercing people to think all rational and self-centered, I think I rather live repressed."
"And our internet sucks relative to other countries like South Korea, Japan, Sweden, Iceland, etc. And we pay MORE for those slower speeds."
Rwanda is equal as fuck.
42 days of paid vacation!! get on our level rest of the world!
"Although Im sure USA would still be in the lead, Id like to see the graph about assault deaths normalized for population percentage. Everyone loves to forget just how large and populated the USA is."
Pakistan has more women in government than the US!? ..
"anyone else notice whos at the top for women in politics? Rwanda. anyone else have an idea how Rwandas doing? yea; not so great. at all. as in one of the worst countries on earth. genocide, political turmoil, etc. then you have Mexico and Uganda up there too. who the fuck thinks *theyre* better off? not saying the women did it, but clearly theres no correlation between women in politics and better outcomes."
/r/MURICA is downvoting the shit out of this
That first map is utter bullshit. 
ITT: Libertarians arguing about what Freedom means.
"Only a few of these graphs really indicate bad things. For example, the fact we dont require maternity leave or vacation time are GOOD THINGS!! We let businesses and individuals decide for themselves. Personally, I do not want to live in a country with required vacation time, I want the freedom to decide for myself whether I want more money (i.e. work more) or want a vacation. Some family friends in Germany are disappointed with their system, because they make the maximum amount as doctors and are required to take time off work. They take off about a week every month (but shouldnt they have the freedom to choose if they want to work and earn more?!)"
You mean 6 graphs. Women in government does not say anything about being overrated or not. Government is a tiny percentage of people.
...^I ^kind ^of ^like ^it ^here
Gas guzzlers? We do love our cars in merica. 
"I adore the united states. Ive lived in a few different countries. I feel pretty free in the US... its all relative, though. "
"Two of these graphs strike me as being entirely out of place in a human rights discussion: maternity leave and paid vacation. Who in their right mind can honestly argue that we, by nature of being human, have the right to paid time off? Its something we would enjoy, certainly. But how can you force a company to spend the enormous amount of money required for something like a month of paid vacation and call it freedom? The company I work for employs (I think) 66 people, with I would estimate an average pay rate of ~$20/hr. If they are required to give 4 weeks vacation, that amounts to just over $211,000 of pure cost (per year), mandated by the government. Yearly sales are probably around $8 million, and lets say 15% of that is profit. Thats $1.2M. So the government is forcing them to spend 17.5% of their net earnings. That said, my employer offers paid vacation that you earn through loyalty - a format I find totally agreeable - Starting with 2 weeks after your first year, another week after 3, and a 4th after 10 years or something. This is a BENEFIT, not a right. Thats a problem with our entitlement culture. People just want everything for free. Paid maternity leave is something I could get on board with easier, but still, I believe something like that would be a benefit an employer offers, not an inalienable right. Having kids is expensive, you should know that before you go making babies. Its a tremendous responsibility that you ought to plan for, not fall into. But thats a topic for another thread. And holy hell Canada! 50 weeks?? Another that stands out to me is the gas guzzlers plot of CO2 per capita. There are so many factors affecting fuel consumption (and efficiency thereof) that I have trouble taking this graph with anything but a grain of salt. Yes I know the US is behind most countries in the regulation of environmental factors like these, but I would like the see how much of these emissions are related to availability and feasibility of mass transit systems in compact vs large countries. Similarly how much the domestic shipping industry is involved (e.g. heavy reliance on trucking for cross country delivery). The violence data is a bit frightening, to say the least. I wonder (wasnt able to read the article/data if its available) how the surveillance states were ranked. What was the criteria? Where did the data come from? Who is the [company?] publishing this research, and what are their ties? TL:DR Im a skeptic, and some of this stuff I dont think really belongs."
"Honestly, I never needed bigger proof than just watching USAs news TV for a couple of hours, of course Im generalizing, but seen from europe, it just seems crazy to live in a country like the states."
"As an expat, its hard to say negative things about the US without hearing OMG YOU THINK UR SO SMRT CUZ U TRAVEL N STUF. But really, these are pretty dead on. The US is a good country, but lacks a bit of modesty sometimes."
"Why is paid parental leave any kind of indicator? My boss isnt going to give me a big chunk of paid free time to climb Mt. Fuji, look after a new puppy or build a boat in my basement. Having a child is every bit the choice those are, so why cant the government force my boss to give me time off to do those thing? If having children is so important to the state, why dont they just pay fertile people not to work?"
"Canadian here. My current job is the first and only job Ive ever had where I got paid for vacation time. That chart is lying to you, there are many ways around paying for employee vacation time. When the union bends you the fuck over and keeps you at part time for 13 years before you get a chance at full time, yet you work 40+ hours a week (except when youre not allowed to because it would make you fall under full time rules) you learn that it isnt as good as it sounds. You Muricans against maternity leave are just retards. Theres just no other explanation for that one. No wonder your kids are mental cases and want to kill everyone. Their parents are off sucking corporate dick to get a new SUV rather than raising their kids."
#1 in wasted potential! 
"Why do people constantly bitch about living in one of the most prosperous nations on earth. Be fucking grateful youre not from Somalia or Cambodia or China or really 95% of the rest of the world. Are we perfect? No, but no country is "
"Guess I am an odd one out, but my company has paid maternity/paternity leave; minimum vacation time at 2-3 weeks that climbs over time till you have upwards of 6-8 weeks; Provides 30 general sick days on top of 6 week paid medical leave followed by extended medical leave at 2/3 pay; And offers great medical insurance (They provide with $1000 [$2000 if covering dependents] for HSA) at around 100 a month."
"We get it, america sucks "
As someone from a country which appears on top of the USA in a few charts I assure you they mean nothing. Women in government; wut?
"How I see it: * Graph 1: Yeah thats bad. * Graph 2: Women can thank the feminism movement for that. * Graph 3: It is sensationalized, it uses a scale of 1-10 for deaths per 100k, yeah, we may currently be 3x higher than everyone else, but it wouldnt sound very significant if you said .002% for eveyone else compared to .005% for the US, presentation of info is key. * Graph 4: Yeah thats bad, but not at the fault of our Government, blame fat people: [the first 4 minutes of this TED vid does a great job explaining while health care is so high](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go_QOzc79Uc) * Graph 5: We also have tons of land to cross, I want to see a gallons per sq. mile graph, also this graph has no titles, how am I supposed to know what 20 is for the US and 12.5 for OECD, that is a worthless graph unless you read paragraph that follows. * Graph 6: Pretty bad * Graph 7: Pretty bad, but at least its getting better. (as long as we get away from people like Palin, she gives female politicians a bad name. The point of this? Basically the article is very anti-USA. Yes our country has a ton of problems that parallel these graphs, but these graphs sensationalize and over-exaggerate the problems by using misleading graphic scale and not very useful context."
"If were really the leader of the free world, then the world really sucks."
I find it interesting how Iraq and Afghanistan have higher female representations in government than the US 
Can anyone link the decline in assault deaths occurring in America in the 1970s? The Freakanomics authors postulated the legalization of abortion. Think about that for a second...
Looks like Im moving to Canada . . .
I love this. Bookmarking for the next time I have to go to murica!
That first map rustles my jimmies all sorts of ways. They have two categories on the legend that dont even appear on the map. WHY ARE THEY THERE! ARE YOU JUST TAUNTING ME!
Women dont need paid maternity leave. We place the burden of caring for women on American men.
"Huh, turns out Canadas the best place to live didnt see that one coming"
i bet Sweden has a sexy fucking government
"You already lost me at the maternity leave thing. While I think its an employers responsibility to offer amenities like maternity\paternity leave, why is making it law or offering it as a tax paid amenity considered more free?"
Just because its not government mandated doesnt put us in last place. Thats kind of the point.
I dont understand paid vacation. Why should someone pay you to not work. 
"And yet, people immigrate _here_ as opposed to emigrate over there. "
"These charts are showing how much power the government has in comparison to other governments around the world. For example, Austria may have 43 mandatory days of vacation, but I know at my work (that Ive only been at for three years) I have a sum of 35 days I can take off, not including 10 sick days. It appears that due to the ability for a union to exist and make a contract with the employer, making negotiations for the what the employees want is more freedom than a politician determining what our workers desire."
Is it just me or is r/politcs actually r/antiusacirclejerk Seriosly.
"Im always curious at the health care issue. It is always framed as stupid Americans spend so much on health care because they are stupidheads. While our system is terrible in some aspects, if you live in another country you should secretly hope we keep this system as this money drives the innovation and the our socialized medicine friends reap just as many benefits from the drug and tech advances without having to pay for it. Were suckers not stupid. Possibly a distinction without a difference."
In other news: Water is Wet.
"I dont get it. This is EXACTLY what reddit wanted for America. You know, 5 years ago when Ron Paul, who genuinely would have put a stop to this shit, was making a serious bid for the White House? But yay, were being oppressed by a half-black guy instead of a white guy - the only true measure of progress!"
There are a lot more complaints than there are solutions to the complaints on a website that has the potential to be much greater. 
Quite saddening given the potential the US has.
Glad im Canadian!
"As an American, holy shit the amount of anti-American circlejerk is fucking hilarious. Heres the thing: yes, many Americans are very conscious of our own pitfalls. We are aware that we have a very expensive health care system. We are aware that the education in high schools falls short. We are aware that we have great military spending, and we are aware that we dont provide much social welfare (like paid maternity leave) compared to some other countries. But heres the thing: we are still #1 in where it actually matters. We are tough people, and that is ingrained in our culture (despite what you see on MTV, and despite the sketches on the daily show). We value work, and we value good work. We push forward the frontiers of technological innovation. And for fucks sake, we have by far the biggest influence in the world. Why is this? It doesnt come around by giving women paid maternity leave. It comes because we are still one of the best in higher education, the one of the best in technological innovation, and one of the best in scientific innovation. Americans (amongst a few other countries) have pushed the frontiers of space exploration. We havent sent people to the moon and rovers to mars by eating McDonalds and being fat. We have the worlds biggest GDP (and before you start saying oh well its still not the best in GDP per capita, you cant really count some countries like Lichtenstein given that they such a small population. Its not easy to have worlds best GDP/capita when you have 300 million fucking people). Oh and yes, we dont provide great social welfare. Cry me a fucking river. People dont come to this country to jack off on government money. People come here to work hard and become billionaires. The american dream exists, but doesnt come easy. I get it though. I would be pretty pissed too if a country had influence in every fucking aspect of my life, starting from TV, internet, politics, economy, w/e you name it. "
"Oh stop whining, America has **much** better living standards than most other countries. You live in a first world country for fucks sake! You have freedom and *a lot* more rights than the vast majority of people in the world so having your internet activity monitored is really light relatively."
"The big problem is that these graphs are not really scientific. All someone did was basically define a political viewpoint and then see if it applied to a certain country. The definitions are so arbitrary that the graphs are meaningless. If they looked about small enough portions of ideas, it might make sense, though."
"After WWII, USA looked good because over half of the world was under communism or warzones or otherwise underdeveloped mudholes and Europe was divided and weak. Today, a lot of countries have gotten their shit together and outcompeting Americans in many areas. Airbus vs. Boeing is an example of this development. In the 1970s Airbus was a tiny player but gradually grew into a serious player. During the last decade Airbus won more orders in most years than Boeing..."
"Im a bit confused why they didnt use Sweden in that chart about maternity leave, Sweden has more than any of those countries."
"&gt;Women in government Rwanda is a shithole and Sweden is the rape capital one way or another. More women being in government has absolutely 0 benefit to Western society. Women GENERALLY dont give a shit about these sorts of things, stop trying to force them into it. I just noticed Japan is at the bottom, a country known for its rape, murder and oppression lol. &gt;Unusually violent Were also a country with an unusually high level of violent, low IQ ~~minorities~~ ([lol not anymore](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/17/latinos-blur-racial-lines_n_2895378.html)). A country where ~6% of the population is responsible for MOST of the crime in the country. &gt;Maternity leave Who cares, working mothers are bad for the health of a society and lead to neurotic children. Once theyre back to the work the kids will very likely be shipped off to a daycare and grow up without meaning. The rest of them Im mostly with you on. tldr; Stupid, panderous list, downvoted."
"Most of these graphs sources have no study notes, nor any conceivable data to back up their graphs in any way. This is closer to numerology then statistics. That being said, we leave it to the states and local municipalities to decide many of these. Several states, and many cities have minimum leave requirements. A lot less than I would like to see, but we are a federated group of individual states after all. "
Heres the one that [worries me.](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100821311)
"if someone wants to make a statement like this, which is perfectly valid, can you at least do what you learned in 6th grade and label the axes on the graph, more specifically the gas guzzler one, wtf does the y-axis stand for? ninja edit: i see you have to read the description in order to see, which is not how it should be!"
Itt: america bad
"A lot of these are symptoms of a free market. Some companies set their own standards with maternity leave, vacation time, etc. Some companies have no standards. As long as people willingly take the jobs with poor benefits, they will keep offering those jobs. So, the question is, do we further restrict the market to impose benefit standards? Or do we let the market do as it pleases? This is not an easy question to answer, and a bunch of biased graphs will not tell us what is best."
[I made a map graph too](http://imgur.com/KjLOowe)
"Reddit, your source for misleading graphs based on arbitrary nonsense. That and sensational politics. USA #3 on the HDI."
"Murica, a first-rate second-rate country!"
Before you go making a scientific post about being overrated you should consider whether overrated is a scientifically descriptive concept.
This country is fucked. 
lol... America is overrated? Then why are there 10000 Reddit threads telling us how bad the USA is? Everyone loves America and everyone outside of America loves to bash on America. America is the best country on Earth - proven by the number of threads on Reddit about her :)
"If you dont like it, you can git out"
I think the only people who overrate America are Americans.
"Though many of these things, such as maternity leave and vacation time is not mandated by the government, it is almost universally provided by US employers and State governments."
I swear the US is the only country whose citizens are eager to shit on themselves.
"The maternity leave and paid vacation are almost ALWAYS covered by the company you work for. I am just saying that even tho it is not REQUIRED by law, it still is in place the majority of the time. "
Most of those issues are that way because thats how Republicans wanted it.
Damn Commies American is #1
Regarding the title - How is that news to anyone? lol
"In America you can drive to 80 different countries, by driving through 5 cities. The diversity is unbelievable. The reason many people like America, is due to reasons you cant plot on a graph"
Must be nice for the OECD countries to spend money on all sorts of things when they know they have the US footing the bill for defense...
"this may sound strange, but doesnt it make sense that the items (like vacation days) where the US doesnt have a set requirement mean that its more free? In the sense that they have the freedom to determine on a case-by-case basis what they want to offer in terms of vacation time? Also the graph is misleading...just because the US doesnt require a set amount of vacation days doesnt mean that we dont get any...at my last job i got 32 days off per year...but no one would know that looking at the graph."
*Youre number one! Youre number one!*
Half of that stuff has nothing to do with being free its a liberal complaint list about how many programs of policies you want we dont have. 
these are probably some of the stupidest indicators used to measure Americas merit. Nothing on that list should disqualify the US from being the hope of the Earth.
"but but, murica is the greatest most bestest nation g*d has ever given man! im reporting this un-american post to obama and the nsa"
yeah but we got guns that makes us more free the euros! - idiots in /r/guns
I think what was most surprising about this was that North Korea has more women in government than South Korea.
"I liked the parts where they did per 100k population for assault crimes when most of the other nations polled dont have more than 100m people living in them. Same argument in general when it comes to law enforcement. we have more land, more cities, more people. naturally, more unrest comes from that. there are so many events that go on that its impossible to chart it."
So Greece is the only country on earth with any real privacy standards?
"The US is #1 in the IT industry, both software and hardware design."
Got to love the ignorant people who have a hate boner for america 
"Came for both sides of circlejerking, was not disappointed."
I know America sucks but it feels like home. I really wish we had socialized health care
A bunch of these are garbage. Thank god we dont have mandated vacation days and maternity leave - open labor markets are a big part of the reason that we recovered so much faster from the Great Recession than Europe. Would I ever work for a company that didnt provide paid maternity leave or vacation days? Absolutely not. Should people be allowed to take such jobs if they want them? Absolutely.
"While there is some criticism to be held towards the graphs this is some pretty good stuff. Well not good, but you get it"
ITT misleading graphs 
What is missing is the thousands of graphs that prove that America is awesome. 
yall need some /murica
"Ah, lets see what this article has to say. First sentence: &gt; As if the recent string of high-profile scandals over **Benghazi**... And thats as far as I read. If an article cannot get the first sentence right, it doesnt deserve my time. Every bullshit claim about Benghazi that supposedly designated it a scandal have been false. Opponents of Obama said the White House politicized the talking points. [Turns out that based on the 100 pages of e-mails released that that was incorrect.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/petraeuss-role-in-drafting-benghazi-talking-points-raises-questions/2013/05/21/db19f352-c165-11e2-ab60-67bba7be7813_story.html). The White House had a mediator role and it was the CIA that edited the talking points based on input from the State Department. Then came the claim that the Administration and military abandoned the victims in Benghazi by telling troops to stand down. [Well, that was apparently false also](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/14/jason-chaffetz/rep-jason-chaffetz-says-special-forces-ready-save-/). I mean ask yourself, why would the military leave its own people to die. Use some fucking common sense. Lastly, they said that the Obama administration lied about the attacks being due to that controversial video. However, the e-mails show that the CIA always considering them a factor and EVERY version of the talking points contained that information. So again, I ask - what the fuck is the Benghazi scandal? I cant read an article that mischaracterizes facts in the first sentence. "
"Canada. Not prefect, but everything good about America without the real bad. We are very fortunate to live in Canada. There are always arguments to be made, but Ive been around the world and love to come home. I hope that things get better in the USA, theres so much potential for great things to come from such a solid foundation of existing in initial freedom. Try not to blame religion or non-religion. Its deeper than a single issue. There are definite trends, its best to throw your personal biases away and get to the reality of the matter. This state of mind makes a unity of nations and this always starts at home. "

idk i live in america and its pretty awesome
"Sure are a lot of people complaining. One of the great things we have in the US is choice. Choose what you want to do with the rules that exist. You know what another choice is? Living here. If you think it is so bad then leave to one of those other fabulous countries. I understand complaining and wanting change, but I have been to other countries (only a couple). I went to Ireland once. I loved it there. I learned the rules and saw how they live. Free education, free health care, benefits of work places such as vacation pay, and maternity pay for both man and female etc etc. They also pay like 50% of their wage in taxes. They also do not get paid the same rate, sure their cost of living is lower however their choices are also lower. The service was horrible comparative to the US. There are many many other rules and things that people just do not think about in the US. To get their drivers license it takes years to become a full license. Their gas was like $5 a liter, or something like that. Of course their cars are way smaller and go further per gallon, not many luxury SUVs. I kissed the ground when I came back from Ireland. That was just Ireland, think would it would be like in other countries, Ireland is a vacation. The point is, here you have many many choices. Yes, most of those choices are luxury. What other choices would there be? As much as you may hate things, the grass is not really greener on the other side. It is pretty easy to find out, visit other countries."

"Im glad that these graphs compare the US with other first world nations, because it shows that the facts on the ground are different than peoples notions, i.e. America and Mexico. Mexico has more maternity leave, more vacation time, and less health care spending per capita. Come on! Which country are people risking their lives to get into again?"
muh freedums!!!!!!!
Reddit makes me feel terrible for being an American.
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ranadiv%C3%A9 Here is a simple story repeated over and over why America is the best country in the world. Its also a good example of free market capitalism. Honestly, if youre smart and have ambition in the US its not that far fetched to become wealthy. A lot of immigrants are in the upper middle class after just 2 generations. "
"Number 1 at getting hated on! Thats OK world, we can take it."
Why are the colors on these graphs not the same as the keys?? It drove me crazy looking at it and trying to figure out which one it was suppose to be...
The US is like a third world country but with a huge ammount of money.
DAE hate America?
"Its amazing how anti-American some on the left are. Its like theyre ashamed of being American. If you think forcing an employer to pay you for choosing to have a baby is a good thing, move to Canada. Its literally right up there. Im pointing north, by the way. If you actually think America is unusually violent, go away. Go away someplace safe like - as the graph states - other OECD. That sounds like such a safe country. If you think our health care sucks... well.. yeah. The quality of health care is among the best in the world. The system we use to pay for it absolutely sucks. Im with ya there. And I love the graph for Gas Guzzlers. Its not comparing America to the rest of the modern world or even the entire OECD. Nope. Its just high income OECD countries. In other words, its comparing a giant, diverse country like the United States with much smaller, much less diverse countries like Sweden (for example). And if you think the government should force - were talking FORCE here - companies to pay you for not working (vacation), then move to Austria. The Austrians force their employers to pay their employees for over a month of not working. All I ask is you LEAVE ANY REMAINING SENSE OF HONOR at the door when you leave this country because theres no honor in forcing another person to pay you for not working. And if you think there is a glass ceiling in America for women, youre an idiot. As a fellow voter, I cant vote for women if they arent running for office. If more women want to run for office, no one is stopping them. "
"I got about three graphs in before I came back here to ask what the fuck any of this has to do with freedom. How the hell do you figure low crime = more freedom? You can get crime down to pretty much zero if your solution is to start chopping off heads and putting cameras and chips in every person. Look at the vacation and paid maternity leave. Apparently were confusing the government mandating everything you do with freedom which is a really bizarre connection to make there. This has more to do with quality of life and pretty much absolutely fucking nothing to do with freedom. Highly socialist does not equal free. You can make a pretty perfect utopia but it would require meddling in everyones lives, requiring everyone to pay ridiculous taxes, and passing ridiculous laws. Say what you want, but the US government still (mostly) trusts its people with the right to own guns, and that represents more freedom than even a single one of these idiotic graphs, especially with regards to how much we drive. Meanwhile, in England, you cant even buy kitchen knives without showing ID, and wearing a hoody is considered malicious. Whoever linked this is almost as stupid as whoever made this. Judging by the comments, the ratings, and the other stuff I see linked on this site, GlobalPost.com is just one giant anti-American circlejerk."

"What a fucking joke. This country is going to shit because of weak, apathetic pussies like op and the author. You want to know what were #1 at? BEING FUCKING AMERICA. Where even the poorest immigrant has the chance to make something of himself. Where racist fucks were silenced by the majority. We fucking knocked down Europes door and fucked up every Nazis sauerkraut shitting asshole and saved Europe because it was too fucking weak to stop one country. Japan wants to kamikaze us? Fine. WE RETURN THE FAVOR WITH NOT ONE, BUT TWO FUCKING NUKES. FUCK YOU JAPAN. I am so fucking proud to be an American, and it disgusts me to see what a bunch of vaginas weve become. Put down the fucking latte, and start believing in your country. Believe in each other. I dont care which boat you hopped off of, or what kind of hole you like to stick your man meat in. We are ALL Americas. Fuck you Europe, and fuck you Asia. You will never dethrone the king of ass kicking. "

"The nations government is the problem. It has been corrupted for at least half a century by representatives only looking out for themselves and big business. I, however, blame European trade for bringing the federal reserve note to the true America those many years ago. This slipped by like a Trojan Horse and dismantled the establishment of global economics for American citizens. This tore a hole in the moral fiber of the people allowing for corruption to fester like a disease. Those born into the recent times of America grew to focus their efforts on social issues with a bias and anger also. Conspiracy, abuse, fear tactics, and falsehood have paved the last bricks on the road to a great nation, and have been laid in the wrong course. Greed took the wheel and America may only recovery if its citizens take part in fixing the broken headlights. Unfortunately, most are fed by the controlled media and are blind to their own abilities. If America falls like Troy, from the inside and burned to a memory, the rest of the world may fall with it. That is my fear. That the giant empire the whole world believed in a long time ago becomes its own enemy. If this happens, I dont blame the country (or countries) for ending the suffering and watching their missiles bring peace to the wage slave cogs we call Americans. My darkest thought on the topic, though, is what if False America is too large to bring down? The rest of the world too frozen with fear to oppose the giant that could kill everyone else with its defeat. **TL;DR** Welcome to the United Snakes: Land of the thief, home of the slave -Brother Ali"

Paid maternity leave is bogus. You shouldnt receive a paycheck because your vagina puked out a kid. I am happy this country does not require it.

"Rankings of and comparisions between nations are not really that useful, particularly when there are so many interdependencies between countries. Also, the influence and power of one nation-state (e.g. US) could have disproportionate ripple effects on the economic, political and social well-being of many other nation-states in a myriad of ways. Those who are able to and feel they have the right to shape our realities use a much larger frame of reference (i.e. the looting classes of the world who make the bulk of economic, political and social decisions). Nationalism now, as in the past, is a useful propaganda tool for many conflicting interests. Most pressing problems we face are global in nature and require solutions of the same scope (implying collaboration extending far beyond nation-states). My issue has never been with American citizens, even the most jingoistic ones, as every country has their fair share of them. The politicians, cultural icons and academics who however waste their intellect and effort on maintaining gross inequalities and hoarding wealth and prestige - they can all fuck right off, regardless of country of origin.

"I love living in the US and I have plenty of freedom. Endemic Surveillance? Im pretty sure I could go out and do tons of stuff and I wouldnt have been surveilled by any agency.

The Internet is another story, and I wont talk about that because all the Internet is surveilled by anybody who wants to surveil. What if I told you that having only one choice of healthcare (govt.) meant less choices? Yes you wont have to worry about paying for surgery, but more security = less choices = less freedom. Im not saying that I completely disagree with healthcare paid by taxes, and it works well in other countries, but your post is about freedom... Mothers/ Fathers, if you arent able to work, then your position should go to somebody who CAN work. And when your kids are old enough, you can return to the workforce. Companies dont make a profit by paying their employees to be gone for two years. Now even I get that this is tough, but it is fair. What if I told you that being able to buy gas guzzlers was indicative of more freedom? Sorry rest of the world, but our gasoline is nice and cheap compared to what you get yours for. Oh and most of it comes from the Americas, NOT from the Middle East. Violence? Well OP, your post is about freedom, and I dont get why violence and freedom are correlated in your mind. Except maybe that I can prevent any undue violence from thieves in my home with my firearm. MANDATED VACATION? What the fuck is that a freedom?

"My American born wife wanted to move to Australia for a few years (with me Australian born husband), to experience it for a while back in 2001. When we were looking to go back to the USA it all looked like it was going to shit (broad generalization I know). We could see the bad liveability stats and things like rates of violence and the religious crazies having too many fingers into the government at various levels. Then there is the militarization of the police; the moves to curtail civil liberties; and the general erosion of the things that used to be considered the great merits of the USA. We thought that Obama might have reversed all the bad stuff that been contributing to the slide downhill. I imagine that despite doing a lot of good, there is only so much that even a dedicated and committed President can do against the inertia that exists in the US Federal Government systems. So it seems to be getting worse. And the changes that the Government is making (such as they are), dont seem to be addressing the underlying issues that erode the merit and reputation of the USA. All this means that we are not moving back to live permanently. We still have family there and travel back every couple of years for Thanksgiving or Halloween (for the kids)."
"Which is the same thing Cummins wants to do, according to [FactCheck.org](http://factcheck.org/2013/06/irs-probe-so-far-yields-partial-partisan-facts/). Both Issa and Cummins are doing the same things -- trying to get media time for specific snippets of testimony that support their message."
"Yeah, we need to fund the NSA somehow! And how else would we defend our borders against the countries we invade, if not for the god-sent mandatory theft on all of our pathetic corporate wages?"

 Not at all. McCarthy was a power grabber and self promoter like Issa. He ran so many people in front of his witch hunt trials that he must have bumped into someone who was guilty. He ruined lives and careers with abusive and dishonest questioning. 
"Being against taxation is a global humanitarian cause, not a right wing agenda.

 That is stunningly stupid. You must be a Libertarian. The tax code was created by congress. The IRS harged with inforcing it. Each of the ourtrageousd loopholes and tax laws was passed by congress. Many are slipped into huge bills like the military of Ag bills that nobodty would dare vote afgainst. But the IRS is not the problem. you have mnisdirected anger.

 Issa wants to take snippets out of context to bolster his right wing anti IRS agenda. He is not a truth seeker. He is no different than McCarthy was a few decades ago. He has no shame. But his life has proven that.
 We need a government and it needs to be funded. Really we need the IRs. But the complicated tax code is not the IRS;s fault.It is congress that passed each and every one of them.

 They did nothing political at all. They actually made a mistake in granting tax free status to organizations that were clearly political. That was what they did wrong. The person in charge is a self stated right winger.

[Reid and Baucus](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/aug/06/context-obamacare-train-wreck/) I agree with them on this. It will be a huge trainwreck at the start. It is just a huge undertaking. There is no way this runs smoothly at the start. But in 2-3 years hopefully its set and the exchanges are a great idea.
" What Dems are saying that? i hear this, with no attribution. The program has not started. nobody knows if it will go well."
"Based on what Ive seen on Healthcare.gov, ACA is anything but affordable and they know it. I make more then the maximum for medicaid despite access being raised because I make a 20k a year instead of less than 15.8k a year. So by Obamacare Im forced to buy insurance I cant afford. Yes I know you get a tax credit, but it wont cover it completely plus I still need to pay thousands of dollars out of my pockets for little more then a year before I get said tax credit on my tax return. Considering I live from paycheck to paycheck that means Id have to get a second job to afford to buy health care, BUT that means Ill be making more money which means my tax credit shrinks. The only way to avoid working a second job after the first year is to dedicate my entire tax return + tax credits towards health insurance. For me that means no more emergency funds for the year for rainy days, car repairs, etc. In the end if you cant afford it and working multiple jobs doesnt make it any easier youre only recourse is to allow yourself to be punished for being poor and not being able to collect welfare by paying the fine. And thats what theyre betting on. They want you to pay a large fine because its really just a tax in disguise and the government is piss broke. Trust me when I say Im all for many of the benefits this law brings us, but in its current state its broken as fuck. The only way to fix things and make it work is to have some kind of public option. Something like Credit Unions for Health Care is what we need so Insurance Companies have some kind of competition to force them to have competitive rates that are actually affordable. This way those tax credits actually mean something and the lower-middle class wont have their tax returns stolen by the government or these greedy insurance companies."
The biggest fear of the Teahouse Republicans is that the ACA will go into effect and after a year or so most people find out what it really entails and like it. 
" No it is a problem of corporations. There is no way that the act could have picked a definition of part time. The corporation would have used any hours named, to cut health care. They do not care about employees. that remains the problem."
Its not popular because MSM is a shithole. Just today Ted Cruz said on meet the press that Americans are overwhelmingly against Obamacare because it doesnt work. How the Fuck does it not work when its not in effect and its the same plan the GOP put together years ago? The host said nothing. 
"I have a PhD. Its my lifes dream to teach at a small teaching focused school; a community college, ideally. I cant find a full time job. Over the summer, I had a hot lead. I had an in on the search committee, was told I was the perfect candidate and theyd be posting the job shortly. Then I was told they opted not to fill the position, instead dissolving it into multiple part-time positions. Ive heard of this happening in more than one place. So Im adjuncting for &lt; minimum wage in total salary. Theres a new policy in place at my state-funded two year host institution; specifically, we can only total (across the entire institution) 28 or so hours of part time work per week. This was not the policy in the past, but it is now. I could be wrong, as I havent studied the law in detail, but I get the sense its not just corporations making these decisions. A law that incentivizes these sorts of practices needs to be re-examined, I think."
"&gt;As shown in the chart below ? using Bureau of Labor Statistics data - the share of full-time workers (in red) has dropped, while the share of part-timers (in blue) has risen. And they make up a greater portion of the American workforce. This change happened during the recession in 2009. http://cnnpoliticalticker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/part-v-fulltime-11.jpg &gt;Claim: 8.2 million Americans can?t find full-time work partly due to Obamacare. FactCheck.org says: False. http://www.factcheck.org/2013/09/obamacare-myths/ TL;DR **This change is very slight and happened before obamacare was even written into law. It is not attributable to the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare.**"
 More popular than Hillary care?
 The hook of health insurance to employment is old in the US. Obamacare is a step to decoupling them. That will make it a lot easier to move from job to job for a better deal. You can even work for yourself. You can get insurance a lot more easily and cheaply.
&gt; The program includes a decision not to force employers to provide healthcare for part time employees. The real solution would be not to force the employer to provide healthcare in the first place by having a single payer healthcare system that is paid for via the normal tax take. Medicare for all is doable but there isnt the political will to actually carry it through because of political opportunism on both the right (tea baggers) and left (so-called blue dog Democrats who are really Democrats in name only).
" The ACA is not as popular as it should be, because the Repubs, Fox and billionaires are lying about it 24 hours a day. It works. It has always worked. They are running ads on TV against it regularly. Yet when people are asked about the elements in it, they are in favor. Should we get rid of the pre existing conditions that insurance companies use to keep some people from getting insurance? Should we stop rescission? Should kids be allowed on parents coverage until 26? Should insurance companies have to spend at least 80 percent of premiums delivering health care? Should we stop insurance companies from dropping people if they get ill? Should there be no lifetime limits? These are popular. They are in the program. But that is not how the right is arguing it. The program includes a decision not to force employers to provide healthcare for part time employees. It ended at 30 hours. So employers figured they could just end healthcare by making everyone part time. That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers."

Should we allow fascism to overtake America? Should this country be destroyed by a dictator? Should jack-booted thugs take your children from you? Brainwashing at its finest.
"&gt; because the Repubs, Fox and billionaires are lying about it 24 hours a day. It works. like jedi mind tricks, it works on the weak minded."
"Thank you for placing the responsibility for bad deeds where it belongs, with the employer. Just like public employees getting pensions are not the bad guy for private workers who have shite benefits. The employers could care a little more about morale and the well being of their workers."
 We need to remove health care from work. That is way down the line.
Note: the employer mandate has been postponed. If your employer is dropping your hours because of Obamacare they are lying. 
wow I didnt know you could be dropped if you get sick. How was that ever legal??
"My dad is directly affected and his hours have been cut to 30 so his work place did not have to provide insurance. Corporations are not responsible for you, you are responsible for you."
" The weird part is if you get seriously ill, you find out how much the insurance companies come between you and your doctor. You fight them to get your bills paid like it is your new job. Endless phone calls , letters and emails have to be made while you are sick and trying to recover. "
"&gt; That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers. But it is indeed a part of the program. If you enact legislation that adds extra operating cost to business but that has an obvious way to avoid that cost, then you have to know that business will work to avoid the extra cost. If the only way for the program to be successful is for the people affected by the program to be stupid or act against their own interest, the program has a problem"
"&gt;That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. Though I agree that what the corporations are doing is horrible, people act based on reward structures. The law was setup in such a way that it rewarded employers for dropping employee hours, so employers responded accordingly. You can argue about whether or not thats moral, but that was the logical outcome given the way the law was written, and it should have been written better. "
"&gt; That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, No, its a problem of the program. People making rational financial choices based upon economic pressures created by legislation is what you would expect people to do. If ACA was relying on employers making dumb financial decisions, then thats a HUGE problem with ACA. "
"If the ACA works it will destroy **their primary goal** of making Obama look like a failure. They try to pull this shit every time a Democrat is in office, but a black guy with a Muslim name has essentially opened the gates of GOP hell. The party is a joke. They wont be winning many more elections with this kind of behavior."
"Universal , single payer is the only answer. That is where it will end. California is on its way there. The ACA has a provision that allows states to experiment with health care. California is leaning toward single payer."
tl;dr: the ACA is much more popular than Obamacare
"&gt; The program includes a decision not to force employers to provide healthcare for part time employees. It ended at 30 hours. So employers figured they could just end healthcare by making everyone part time. That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers. I was under the impression that the ACA forces employers with more than 50 FTE employees to pay for health insurance, whether or not those 50 FTEs come from 50 full time employees, or from 100 part time ones. I was under the impression that it is designed this way precisely so businesses cannot just cut employees hours to get around providing benefits. Am I wrong, or are you?"
"You forgot the incredible money and power of health insurance companies, durable medical goods manufacturers, and drug companies. "
"I dont want to detract from your point - its an excellent one, but if you think about it, allowing children under 26 on their parents plans is much like the 30-hr cap. Were requiring companies that offer benefits to subsidize companies that dont. I saw this firsthand when a co-workers benefit costs doubled after adding her 24-yo daughter, who is presently employed in (get this) the healthcare industry. Her employer realized an $8,000/yr cost savings by passing it onto my company. A much better answer wouldve been tax incentives for companies that pay healthcare premiums for their employees &amp; tax penalties (perhaps based on total work hours instead of F/T, P/T or temp status) for employers that dont. Pay the premiums or pay the taxes - your choice."
 So they should have made it so all employees regardless of hours would have coverage?
"&gt; That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations. Yeah, but that was an outcome foreseeable by *every single person who has ever run a business*. Companies are in business to make money, if forcing every employee to work part time is cheaper than giving everyone healthcare, then thats what theyll do. If they have to provide health coverage, the premiums are going to skyrocket and the coverage is going to get worse. Is not offering your employees health coverage a dick move? Yes, probably, but in the real world you simply cannot legislate away dickishness. Even if ACA is going to help people who could not get health insurance previously get it, it has already ruined health insurance for people who used to have it. Why is that acceptable?"
"Legal, ethical, moral, all terms that have nothing to do with the corporate mentality. It is about money."
"As Im not an American, I dont see these ads, but Im curious... what exactly is their argument against it (other than just its socialism!) I mean what are they actually claiming on TV that is bad about it? Presumably, even if they are basically protecting their rich buddies in corporations, or just trying to kill it to destroy Obamas presidency, surely they must be putting forward some (however fake) set of points to justify to the public why its bad."
Not if you make them into 29 hour workers. 
"The ACA is much more popular than Obamacare. In fact, if you watch Fox news lately, they are going out of their way to call it the ACA. "
" The part you ignore is the worker /company relationship. Companies used to pretend that they cared about employees and their welfare. Now it is clear. Workers are just problems and expenses to be controlled. Any way they can cheat someone is a good way. Some helped pay for health insurance. Now they have a way to escape that too. But it is not their fault. If you accept that companies owe nothing to workers, then you agree with them cutting hours to escape health care costs. It is just a business decision. there are no humans there, just Social Security numbers."
"It was such an obvious move by corporations that it should never have been made law. A corporation wants to make money. If you make them spend more then they want to, they try to find a way to cut costs. When you make it as simple as just having your employees work for 29 hours, what do you honestly expect? This is exactly why Republicans talk about how government doesnt understand business. "
" That makes no sense. Companies have an option to treat their workers respectfully. Can you image they would want their workers to be safe from an illness destroying their lives? The ACA was no just a Dem dbill. The Repubs had plenty of input. Bills do not just appear one day. They are fought over in committees before they get to the floor. There are people arguing that since the Repubs did not vote for it all, they had nothing to do with it. That is incorrect. They just voted against it in bloc, like they frequently do. But they were deeply involved in the process."
"&gt;That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers. People respond to incentives. This is undeniably true. So if you design a program that doesnt take that into account, you are either incredibly naive, or stupid. Its your call as to which the ACA is, but regardless, it *is* the problem of the program. In your case, you seem to take the naive route. EDIT: I guess the other option is that this outcome was *intended* by the ACA. I doubt youll argue that though, but for the sake of completeness I guess I should include it as an option."
" There was a time when companies did look out for their employees. If the company succeeded, the workers did. There were bonuses and raises when they did well. Now when a company does well, it all goes to the top. The worker/company dynamic is inimical. You work knowing the company is trying to squeeze you and eliminate you. There was a time you worked hard to help the company. You were tied to its success. Now no matter how much they make, your job is not safe."

"This. Exactly this. Unfortunately though, Obama has not done a very good job handling these budget crises. Each time budget talks up they end up kicking the can further down the road, which only plays in the favor of the Republicans who can use it to hold another political issue hostage."
"&gt; The ACA is not as popular as it should be, because the Repubs, Fox and billionaires are lying about it 24 hours a day. You are the kind of person that gives /r/politics its bad name. Numbers released by the U.S. Gov actually state that premiums will increase by an average of $130 in all 50 states. Every state will have an increase. The ACA gives itself a bad name. Blaming right wingers for giving a bad act a bad name is like saying Americans give a bad name to Hitler. The general ignorance with this act is free healthcare, which it is not at all. From what Ive been seeing on even nightly national news is that pushing obamacare to next year could actually help the program gain traction politically."
&gt; It works. It has always worked. We have always been at war with Oceana.
"Im sorry, but you cant blame its unpopularity only on fox and republicans. Part of the reason its unpopular is because Obama said that hell keep his promise that if you like your health care provider you can keep your health care provider. How can you keep your health care provider if you lose your health care provider because the company you work for drops them because its cheaper to pay the penalty and make you opt into the ACA? You cant. Thats just one of many lies Obama and democrats have told about the bill. One of the reasons I dont like it is because Congress has exempted themselves *and* their friends from it. Another reason I dont like it is because the federal government is wasting $70,000,000,000.00 tax payer dollars on a nationwide marketing campaign trying to put a happy face on this bill when people can see its not everything we were told. Another reason a lot of people dont like it is because the while time it was being pushed through Congress the president and democrats went out of their way to say its not a tax. Well, viewing it as a tax is the only way it got passed. People are sick and tired of being taxed. Basically, there are a ton of reasons not to be exactly stoked about this bill, none of which have anything to do with Faux news or republicans."
 Taxes are at 60 year lows. I can not get excited by people who dont want to pay taxes to keep up the commons. Our taxes are too low to maintain the infrastructure. Taxes for the rich and corporations have been getting slashed over and over since Reagan. You will not be satisfied until taxes are at zero.

" You are partially right for the wrong reasons. The fact is insurance companies only add cost. They make money not by delivering health care, but by denying it. That is a huge expense that should have been eliminated. "
" They wont be getting Blue Cross . They will get ACA, which will have lots of companies competing to sell coverage. How does Obamacare make Blue Cross more expensive? The ACA does not even go into effect until Jan 1. You can check policies out Tuesday. "
My parents just got a letter from Blue Cross saying that their insurance just jumped from $552 to $1397. Thats over $10200 a year. This bill is VERY unpopular in my household right now. 
You will have a lot of options in a new policy. There will be lots of companies offering coverage. You might see some real competition. 
This is why the ACA isnt popular: http://i.imgur.com/dSgYEKN.jpg
There lots of things wrong with this bill too. Its overly complicated and will cause billions in costs. The way they calculated part time to equal full time will hurt labor. The whole thing is fucked. Not a liberal law at all. 
 Where do you get overly complicated? It is a huge bill that has to describe all the options and rules. Do you think they just added extra words for some reason? It will save money in the long run. in the short run it has already slowed the growth in medical care costs. 
The individual survey questions you ask are heavily biased in terms of wording. You can ask a similarly biased version of every question that would illicit the opposite response in the same person. Should people who elected not to purchase health insurance be allowed to buy it regardless of the impact their bad health would have to increase others premiums? Should we punish companies with more efficient insurance pools that are able to profit more than 20% of what they take in from premiums? Should people who committed fraud about preexisting conditions when buying insurance be liable to be dropped from their new insurance? The same measures are suddenly wildly unpopular. The right is putting dollars into TV advertising on the bill because the law was passed with a clause that allows Obama to use tax dollars to promote it (thats called propoganda).
Yeah but the ACA turned into such a shitty bill. It started out so good but it was butchered completely by lobbyists. Id much rather have them rewrite it than keep it just because it kinda does something good.
" Wonder why the Repubs are fighting so hard/ Not because it will fail, but because it will succeed. If they really believed it was going to blow up, the Repubs would have provided the match. But they know ,if it works out, the Repubs are in serious trouble, The Repubs are concerned about elections and power. They care zero about your health care problems,."
"&gt; That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers. It actually is the problem of the program. The whole point of economics is to understand incentives and how they work. The program creates a clear incentive to put people on part time work or fire full timers and hire more part time staff. Its inevitable that people will follow incentives, and its not just our system, its human nature. Writing a plan that relies on people doing the right thing in YOUR eyes is really just not writing a good plan. At least in that one regard. Dont get me wrong, I hate corporates for other reasons, but this is not the right time to say because corporations."
"Im around some pretty hardline GOP types often, their arguments for being against obamacare are pretty simple: * I dont want to pay for someone else to get medical care - Well buddy you already are. * Its going to force me to do something - Youre already doing it and youre never going to stop * (from a few small business workers) NO ONE KNOWS HOW IT WORKS!!! - well yeah there will be some adjusting but Ill take some adjusting to the current shit storm we have now. The I dont want to pay for someone else is the one that always gets me. Its almost always tied to the lazy welfare queens with 8 kids get better medical attention than me! or something along those lines. They never take into account the millions of working poor that will benefit, they just dont want that one abuser to get something free."
" Reagan told about the welfare queen. The NYT spent 6 months looking for someone who filled out the Reagan claim. they could not find one. The whole premise is a lie, but works because some kinds of people are looking for an excuse to step on people below them."
" Yes, are some stupid people running companies. What about the staff they have fighting through the terrible health care system we have now? Did they all get hit in the head last weekend?"
" So the owners have nothing to do with it? they can choose to treat their employees fairly. But you seem to think that is not a valid option. If there is a way to screw over workers, they should do it."
"&gt; So employers figured they could just end healthcare by making everyone part time. That is not the problem of the program. We live in world constrained by incentives. If a program ignores this, it is indeed the problem of the program."
 That is your problem. you expect Cruz to tell the truth. He is running for president. WHAT A TERRIFYING THOUGHT. 
" You qualify for a subsidy. health care is not supposed to reach 10 percent of after tax income. If you are in a red state, it may be true. "
" Tommy Douglass is always voted the popular politician in Canadian history. His contribution, the Canadian health care system. Obama could go down in history as one of the greats. Cruz will be in the trash bin when it all ends. That is why the Repubs are desperate to kill the ACA."
" Once it passed, the rightys started a huge publicity campaign to criticize it all day and all night. Huge corporations and very wealthy people own TV and radio stations. They slam it night and day. They actually run ads trying to scare people away from it. In America, it works well. people know they hate it, they just dont know why."
" Red states were sitting on the suppression laws. As soon as the court okd it, the laws flew out of Republican legislatures, already written . If you can not compete on ideas, dont let the other guys vote. You can still maintain control."
"If I remember correctly, either Texas or North Carolina had one ready the same day as the ruling."
 Correct? You mean agrees with whatever the v=election bureau has in its records. Do you always add your middle name when you get proof? Do you sometime use a middle initial? Did you get married and not change every single item of proof? Any of those DQs you. Is that stopping fraudulent voting?

"&gt; You mean agrees with whatever the v=election bureau has in its records You mean the records that are the responsibility of the voter to keep updated. &gt; Do you always add your middle name when you get proof? Do you sometime use a middle initial? Did you get married and not change every single item of proof? Any of those DQs you. All that is the responsibility of the voter. Dont update your voter registration with your full, legal name (a legal requirement), then you dont get to vote. Take the 5 minutes, go online to your states voting registration site, and update your shit like youre supposed to do. Im getting kinda fed up with everyone treating voters like children and doing everything they can to absolve voters of their own mistakes. &gt; Is that stopping fraudulent voting? No its not. But just like any other law thats been pased by duly elected representitives, signed by the governor, and stool up to legal scrutiny (e.g. Obamacare), its a freaking law. Stop throwing a freaking tantrum, update your crap, and vote. **Edit v2** You know whats pissing me off about /r/politics? This damn idea that everyones views are black and white. Damn near every other post of mine has had the big disclaimer that I think the laws are pointless and only solve a problem that doesnt exist. And Ive never denied the massive evidence showing why the laws were enacted. My only complaint has been the massive amount of hyperbole coming from the left about the issue. I havent seen this big of a tantrum since Republicans claiming that Obamacare would create roaming death panels aimed at the elderly. Last year I fought the onslaught of actual conservative paid accounts throwing all sort of crap around /r/politics. The over usage of logical fallacies by the right was damn near overwhelming. And here the left is doing the damn same thing. * No I dont think these laws are needed. * Yes I understand why Republicans passed these laws * Yes I feel that you have follow a law, even if its passed for political reason * No, I dont see disenfranchisement * Yes, I think that adults should fully responsible for not doing what they should be doing according to law * No, my views are quite opposite of misogyny. Im treating women equally and you are perpetuating the gender role of a poor, helpless woman who needs to be protected from the world! Ive defended the claim that /r/politics is a circle-jerking echo chamber. Ive always said Democrats are the more honest, and open minded party of the two. And I always thought that polite, decently written discourse was what Reddit was about. My posts, that are days old and have nothing to do with politics, are getting steamed rolled because some dumbfuck cant take the time to set their emotions aside and read what is written; instead they choose to punish a Misogynistic GOP Shills comment history. So fuck it, you can have /r/politics all to yourselves. Im done here. And just for shits and giggles, I leave you with [todays Politifact post.](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/oct/31/democratic-governors-association/no-evidence-behind-claim-2011-voter-id-law-came-be/)"
"&gt; Yes, people are signing up. But, like Social Security, it is based on the same flawed design. You are adorable if you think social security is flawed and cant be fixed with a minor adjustment. &gt; The ACA needs, and I mean NEEDS, young people to enroll. Correct. Did you know this is already happening and that the data has been released which proves this? Of course you didnt. Right wing diatribes *never* include data to support their claims. Let me help you: http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/obamacare-enrollment-demographic-breakdown &gt; This is, of course, assuming that the ACA will operate at break-even. Better than that, actually. Heres what the CBO has to say about it: http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43471 &gt; In fact the numbers appear to show that, in the not so distant future, premiums will have to increase for the ACA. Of course you dont say by how much, leaving it open ended to sow FUD. The Kaiser Family Foundation also released a report last month that concluded if 25 percent of the enrollment pool were young people, the resulting premium increase might be only 1 to 2 percent, not enough to fatally undermine the laws actuarial base. Please point on the chart where a 2+% increase (because Im a pessimist) would stick out seriously: http://origin.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2011/10/premium-growth.png "
Whats flawed about Social Security?? Theyre only going to get 1.72% instead 2%? OMGWTFBBQ! I guess the Republicans will have to step up their Obamacare bashing - maybe then it will go OVER 2%.
Social Security is a botched design? You just voided your whole argument by beginning like that. 
"The same deal of young people contributing versus older people drawing out funds. When Social Security was set up the ratio of contributors to drawers was significantly higher than it is today. By 1955 the ratio was about 9 to 1, as of 2011 that ratio is more of 2.9 to 1, and expected to drop to 2.1 to 1, or even 1 to 1 by 2031 [LINK](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/fast_facts/2013/fast_facts13.pdf) check out slide 36. As for the difference between 1.72% and 2% (assuming the population is at 330 million) is about 1 million people. If those people were paying $200/month, that is $200 million dollars per month of lost gross income, or $2.4 billion dollars annually. All of a sudden that 0.28% looks a lot bigger. Edit: format"
"Just to be clear, it is an assumption that the ACA is working. Yes, people are signing up. But, like Social Security, it is based on the same flawed design. The ACA needs, and I mean NEEDS, young people to enroll. Why? To offset the cost of paying for the medical expenses of older people. An older person might, for example, be paying in $200/month but using $600 /month. Thus, the ACA needs 2 additional people paying $200/month and using $0.00/month just to cover the expenses being created by the first person. This is, of course, assuming that the ACA will operate at break-even. Why cant it operate at a loss, you might ask? It can, but not in reality. The fact is that it can dig a debt hole to pay the expense, remember these expenses are going to third party providers and not just the Government moving money around within itself, thus the funds for payment of services will be going from the Government to, say, your local hospital. The money has to come from somewhere. That leaves the Government the following options: (1) print more money, pay with newly minted funds and increase inflation; (2) borrow money, by running over budget and increasing the debt ceiling (remember, those monies will have to be repaid by the tax payers as the Governments primary source of income); (3) increase the premiums of the people enrolled in the ACA, defeating the purpose by making health insurance less affordable. Yes, companies are realizing that by taking away employer provided health insurance they can reduce expenses and increase profits. And, yes, this most likely will mean for those employees who are already paying for health insurance, they will go out and find health insurance on their own, either from a health insurance provider or from the government. But that does not mean that the ACA is working. Heck, the CBO admits that they budgeted, and set initial premium, based on having an estimated 40% of enrollees being young people. Right now that number is at 27%, way, way below the estimate. Right now 3.3 million have signed up, which is about 1% of the population. They were budgeting for about 2% of the population signing up, but based on current enrollment statistics it appears that they will only get about 1.72% (approx) of the population enrolled. When not enough people have enrolled and the vast majority of those who have enrolled are not young people (73%) premiums will rise, or taxes will rise, to offset the increased cost of the ACA. Thus, it is too early to say whether or not the ACA is working. In fact the numbers appear to show that, in the not so distant future, premiums will have to increase for the ACA. They say, in the article, the 3% increase of young people enrolled in January is even more encouraging. But if that increase continues through the end of the enrollment period (end of March) the percentage of young people enrolled will only be 33%, or 83% of what they budgeted for. TL;DR: Whether or not the ACA is working is yet to be determined, it is too early to say it is working. Shortfalls in total enrollment and more especially, in the enrollment of young people, could drastically change the premiums being paid by those who have already enrolled for the worse."
"I stated previous numerous easy ways to fix the future insolvency of the SSA. Thus, I do believe that it can be fixed. Not only that but provided various options to do so. I clearly reiterated the portion of the article which stated that the total enrollment of young people had increased from 24% to 27%. I did not know that it was designed to function at lower levels than stated in the article. Thank you for providing a link like I requested others do. As for the break-even comment I was not taking into account reductions in other government expenditures off setting the costs of the ACA. I didnt say how much because, honestly, I dont have the time or the resources to conduct a proper statistical analysis of the situation. But, it is reassuring to hear that others agree with me that premiums will have to increase. The chart is nice but it doesnt compare employer based insurance premiums versus non-employer based insurance premiums, which is what we are looking at with the ACA, non-employer based insurance (unless of course you work for the US Government). Thank you for providing sources. I appreciate it. It is reassuring to read that the ACA will not fail if enrollment benchmarks are not achieved. I believe that the 40% young people to be a very tough goal to achieve, simply because it is much more likely that the breakdown of the demographics for enrollment will more likely match the age demographic breakdown for the nation as a whole, based on shear numbers (for example there will be more older people enroll than young people because there are more older people than young people in America)."
"[LINK](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/fast_facts/2013/fast_facts13.pdf) to social securitys insolvency as provided by the Social Security Administration, released Aug. 2013, check specifically slide number 37 (or page 43) either way the last page of the pdf. They clearly state Social Security is not sustainable over the long term at the current benefit and tax rate. They further state that beginning back in 2010 they started paying out more than they were taking in. Sure they have a cushion built up, but how long will it last with the contribution rate continuing to decline and the payout rate continuing to increase. Know your facts."
"&gt; Where do you get this stuff? Oh, you know, the usual Republican propaganda media sources, like the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/07/the-white-house-effort-to-blame-insurance-companies-for-lost-plans/), [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/), and the [Associated Press](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-slippery-claims-health-law-budget-120756800.html). &gt;It was well know that it COULD well happen, but there was no intention. It was well know that it **WOULD** happen. With all of the ACA implemented, the administration expected [93 million to lose their plans](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/10/31/obama-officials-in-2010-93-million-americans-will-be-unable-to-keep-their-health-plans-under-obamacare/). Of course, *Obamacare is simply so awesome and the reform so urgently needed for our country that Obama keeps delaying implementing much of it.* &gt;It was a one year extension. Nothing more. 1. The fact that it is still only a delay, as opposed to a permanent change, *is exactly the reason why the promise to be able to keep your plan is **still** a lie.* 2. Only delayed a year so far. [The administration is going to announce a further delay, up to 3 years more (4 years delay total)](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/admin-said-be-eyeing-insurance-extension), because Obamacare is simply so awesome and such urgently needed reform. 3. My point was about meddling with corporations?which you seem to have thought that I was blanketly opposed to?and showing you how Obama did it anyway, despite your claims otherwise. &gt;Just because someone doesnt currently approve of the job hes doing, doesnt mean hes an awful president...I have a pretty clear stick for measuring and he dont make it there yet. instead of plain disapproval, how about *strong* disapproval? [Would tying the amount of strong disapproval that Bush had when leaving office convince you?](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll) Honestly, I dont think there is any data that will convince you. So far you seem as unswayable as a religious Creationist. If all of this cant convince you, what convinced you that people widely thought Bush was a bad president in the first place? Im guessing it was an anecdotal judgment rather than a scientific one. &gt;History, again, will bare that out. It hasnt been so long since George Bush was president. It seems hypocritical for you to be so sure Bush was a bad president when history hasnt been there to bare that out yet. &gt;so what if its a bare minimum requirement You have such low-standards such that your opinion isnt very meaningful? &gt;I am not sure what a good president is, to be honest. But you know that Obama is a great president as per my original prompt, because of healthcare. Got it. &gt;he did bring it back from the edge that the republican and a republican president pushed us to with de-regulation, wars paid for on credit cards, a hugely unfunded Medicare Part D implementation thats costs us billions every year. Please tell me how Obama re-regulated the part of the economy responsible for the financial crisis (most economists say the systemic problems are worse under Obama BTW), how Obama didnt pay for more wars on our credit card by continuing military action in Afghanistan, many years in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Pakistan, etc., and the Medicare Part D which Obama permits to *still* cost taxpayers billions each year. I find your comments both hilarious and sadly revealing. &gt;That has a lot to do with it. If you dont believe that, you are simply lying to yourself. Please show me all hard data you used to come to this conclusion. You seem to have such a high standard for judging Obamas performance, I cant even imagine what comprehensive data sets you are using to come to this conclusion. Unless you have double-standards of course. Little old biased me points to [surveys like these showing no major differences in racism expressed by either political party](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/08/racism-by-political-party.html), and I then I *lie* to myself to come to the wrong conclusion! I mean, there is no other explanation other than racism when [that majority of all those super Evangelical, racist Millenials say they would vote to recall Obama](http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/millennials-abandon-obama-and-obamacare-20131204). &gt;they SUPPORTED many of the policies until presented by a democratic president Besides the foreign policy stuff and the deficit, I dont think there is much else different compared to what the GOP base supported at the end of Bushs second term. You arent going to say the Heritage Plan from 20+ years ago which I already debunked, are you? If you really want to see an epic double-standard, try looking at how quickly Democrats reversed their opposition to the temporary Bush Tax Cuts when Obama signed them into permanent law, or their embrace of the security state now that Obama and not Bush is in control of the drone assassinations. &gt;Let me know when Obama hits a 77% disapproval rating OK. So Bush was an ok president for Americans when his disapproval rating was 76%? 75%? Again, you sadly resort to the comparison game instead of accepting that a president can be bad on their own without being as bad some other guy. [A president can be bad at 56% disapproval, too.](http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/w94t9k1idp/trackingreport.pdf) &gt;However, that was not the case, and he had to work around the current piss-poor republican contingent and that hampered his presidency. As I have been saying, judging Obama based on what he *does* have control over (drones, Patriot Act, NSA, Obamacare legislation, Obamacare implementation, etc.) is *exactly* why you should think he is a bad president."
"&gt; You fail to understand what seemingly every fact checker in America understands. The ACA intentionally makes it near impossible to have a plan grandfathered; the intention was to have these plans cancelled from the beginning. Where do you get this stuff? Do you make this up? There was NO intention. It was well know that it COULD well happen, but there was no intention. What the fuck would the purpose in that be? &gt; I guess he did anyway to try to compensate for his epic lie (though it looks like at the state level they are refusing to enforce it). It was a one year extension. Nothing more. Again, a way to ease the rollout. Didnt work well, given, but it still had to be done. Just like a lot of other tweaks they had to implement. Its an ongoing process, just like the rollout of Medicare Part D. Its going to take a while to get it right. &gt; Newsflash: most Americans think Obama is an awful president too, even worse than where Bush was at this same point in his presidency. Theres a huge leap. Just because someone doesnt currently approve of the job hes doing, doesnt mean hes an awful president, no matter how much you want to believe that. I dont approve of the job hes doing, but I certainly dont think hes an awful president. When he succeeded an awful president. I have a pretty clear stick for measuring and he dont make it there yet. &gt;Translation: Republicans presented even worse candidates, so Obamas awful policy choices and mistakes dont make him a bad president. Hmm, I wonder why that is, maybe they dont have any good candidates? Or maybe the republican base has lost its fucking mind, listening to the constant drivel coming from the mouths of Rush, Beck, and Hannity. &gt; It doesnt make him a good president. Certainly most Americans disagree, and I would think their judgement is more important. It doesnt make him an awful president either, it just doesnt. History, again, will bare that out. &gt; This is a bare-minimum expectation, not some sort of profound achievement, though I would largely say that attributing responsibility for economic performance to the president is fallacious most of the time. LOL, so what if its a bare minimum requirement, he did bring it back from the edge that the republican and a republican president pushed us to with de-regulation, wars paid for on credit cards, a hugely unfunded Medicare Part D implementation thats costs us billions every year. &gt; Is your bar for being a good president really that low? Well, seeing that the only decent presidents in my lifetime were a democrat, and a completely neutered republican(Bush I), I am not sure what a good president is, to be honest. I thought for a very long time that Regan was a great president. However, after really going back and looking at his record on human rights, the economy, and many other areas, I determined that simply wasnt the case. He was a fair president at best. &gt;Clearly the majority of Americans who think Obama is a bad president only do so because he is black, That has a lot to do with it. If you dont believe that, you are simply lying to yourself. White Republican Evangelical America was not ready for a Black president. Everyone else was, but the bible belt certainly was not. There has been a complete lack of support for ANYTHING this president has done since he took office. The republicans came out on the day(or maybe it was the day after) his inauguration and said we intend to make him a one term president. And they did everything they could for four years to block everything he supported, even IF they supported before he did. Its been comical watching the republicans for these last few years contradict themselves time after time after time just so they could rail on the president for this or that. To be honest, given the resistance to everything the man has done, I think hes done a pretty good job of TRYING to work with the recalcitrant republican party. The republicans have been a disgusting bunch the entire time he was in office. And I believe history will show that as well. Once the books are written it will be talked about how he was able to get anything done. &gt; as nothing to do with awful performance, and supporting policies that half the country is opposed to. Again, the point is they SUPPORTED many of the policies until presented by a democratic president. Its that simple. it really is. Im surprised he got anything done at all. &gt; You really cant stop doing it, can you? Nixons approval rating before watergate was quite high. Hes judged based on his actions in watergate. Was Nixon actually a bad president or does his scandal define his presidency? On the merits, Bush WAS awful: http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/roper/presidential/webroot/presidential_rating_detail.cfm?allRate=True&amp;presidentName=Bush Let me know when Obama hits a 77% disapproval rating OK. &gt; I have sometimes flirted with doing this, though I suspect for different reasons. I would not doubt its for different reasons, I would expect that, but the fact that you even thought about it should tell you something. That party has lost its way and is destined to be a player only in local elections, which trust me, is a powerful place to be. Just look at what the loonies are doing to my beloved North Carolina. Look, I have no illusions that Obama is an awesome president. I DO fully believe he is a better president than Bush was. That being said, I have some serious bones to pick with him about transparency, drones strikes on Americans, furtherance of the Patriot Act and media targeting. But I think he brought some worldwide respect back to the office of the President that Bush pissed away. I think he took many of the right actions on the economy, to repair the immediate damage. Obama will not go down in history as one of the great American presidents. That being said, he will not go in as one of the worst either and had he had a republican party that would work with him, even in the slightest, it could have been better. However, that was not the case, and he had to work around the current piss-poor republican contingent and that hampered his presidency. Thats not an excuse, its a fact. "
You will find pretty much no examples of a CEO being ousted. Theyre all quietly forced to resign to save face for the CEO and the company.
&gt; Plenty of companies pay their employees more than they have to - everything from Costco to Google - and shareholders love them. Actually the CEO of Costco mentioned that Wall Street thinks hes overly generous to employees. http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/costcoceo.asp
"&gt; Wall Street thinks hes overly generous to employees. The quote says Some Wall Street analysts. Of course there are some who feel that way, but that doesnt mean its representative of anything. Wall Street analysts dont have much influence over how shareholders vote, especially when a company is performing well. Costcos stock has outperformed the Dow Jones by a wide margin over the past 5 years. Id say thats a good indication that overall, shareholders are extremely happy with Costco. "
"Exactly - but by their own board, not by shareholders. "
"Bullshit. Its extremely rare for shareholders to actually vote to oust a CEO. Name a single example of where a CEO was ousted because they wanted to invest more in their own employees. Plenty of companies pay their employees more than they have to - everything from Costco to Google - and shareholders love them. The only thing likely to happen if you cut into profits to increase salaries is that your stock price will go down *in the short term*. If it improves employee retention and customer loyalty, though, the stock price will go right back up again, in line with expectations of future profits. "
"it depends which promises you look at. Sometimes you have to give the benefit of the doubt, like in these cases, but he didnt really run on placing appellate court nominees. HE did run on bipartisanship, and then immediately told the other side to go get bent ( actual quote was we won, we dont have to compromise ) . He also ran as a disruptor to the status quo, and first thing he did was open the coffers to his buddies for payback and assurance that it was all campaign rhetoric. Oh, and transparency . You cant really judge a president as bad while he is still in office, but you can judge as dishonest on some big issues, all of which were to attract the moderate vote. "
"You really can judge some presidents bad while in office. Case in point, Bush and the Iraq war, claimed to be over weapons of mass destruction. However I agree with your main point.

&gt;Diane Feinsteins husband &gt;Feinstein &gt;stein /pol/ was right again.
The rest of the world asks: How do you sell a post office? 
"This doesnt surprise me remotely. I actually see it as foreshadowing for what is to come, and has been coming for a long time."
"Not surprising in the least. This lady is to California what Michelle Bachman is to Minnesota. The term un-American is too cliche, so Ill simply state that, regardless of whatever political party you support, she is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with this country. Pro-war without facts, pro-surveillance without reason, and anyone who disagrees is an enemy. Anytime now I expect her to support drone strikes on citizens on American soil. Wouldnt shock me in the least if she were to declare it one day on TV. Ill always lean blue, but this lady scares me to the point where Id rather have script kiddies on 4chan represent me, because at least Id know what to expect."
"This is nothing new, she was investigated for giving defense contracts to companies her husbands company either owned or had high stakes in. She is one of the dirtiest congress persons there is. http://www.dailypaul.com/272132/insider-trader-war-profiteer-chinese-company-invested-dianne-feinstein"
"I remember she came and spoke to my senior civics class in high school. In the question and answer section, I asked her, What kind of person were you in high school?. I remember she paused, and in a betraying tone, she said I was popular and well known, I was a cheerleader. Psh."
The dismantling of the [USPS](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr6407) was a bi-partisan effort. Two Democratic co-sponsors. Passed in a unanimous and unrecorded voice vote with almost zero deliberation in both the house and the senate. This is what happens when both parties work together. Remember that. 
"Fuck Diane Feinstein. She is a politician for the sake of being a politician, she doesnt give a shit about the people she oppresses, she just wants their vote."
"Its almost impressive how diverse the hate is for Diane Feinstein. From the 1st Amendment, to the 2nd...to the 4th, I feel like shes tried to take an eraser to the constitution too many times for people to trust her. "
When is California going to recall this traitor?
"As a..erm...democrat, I can say that without a doubt its time for this bitch to go. The corruption, it burns! And its over and over and over again. I hesitate to call myself a democrat these days, even though Ive been heavily involved in the party and acted as precinct committee person for a while there. It was actually my involvement with the democratic party that made me hyper disillusioned with it. The other regular democrats, the people I worked with were awesome and genuine. But when I started moving up enough to get to know our representatives, and the major contenders running for office - I honestly wanted to take a fucking shower after every encounter. I couldnt believe that bullshit charisma can take slime so far. And it blew my mind that my fellow workers would fall in line, blinded by those twinkly smiles that held no substance. The only time I ever actually got a reasoned and insightful response when I dove deep into policy discussion was from a woman running for the school board. I worked my ass off to get her elected. But everyone else just sidestepped questions or tried to snow me with bullshit soundbites. But lots of smiles and really attractive spouses and kids in tow. It was a fucking parody of itself. Politics. Never again. EDIT; I want to make very clear here that Im not saying Dems are worst than Republican politicians. Ive had a few encounters with Republican politicians that were pretty much identical. The thing that killed me about hanging out with most politicians is that they obviously didnt have a fucking clue about what they were talking about, and didnt even give a shit about not having a clue so long as most people thought they had a clue. The moment you questioned them, theyd simply divert the conversation. And these were people I shared beliefs with. At least I thought I did. I mean, I shared the overall sentiment, but wanted more detail on implementation/ramification."
"Ive written this woman about a dozen emails and contacted her through the We The People links, simply to tell her how much I loathe her political agenda and policies. Just another politician who is convinced the world needs to adopt her agenda. Is there some way she could be implicated in this? If she had knowledge of what her dumbass husband was doing this whole time? Seriously, this woman is old, out of touch with her constituency and now shes got a criminal sleeping in her bed next to her. What more do you need to get her out of politics and into the nursing home?"
"Hell get prosecuted, I predict, because he committed combination of crimes unforgivable to the aristocracy 1) he got caught 2) he sold them too cheap Cant have deflation on corruption, now."
"In the town I grew up in, the old historic post office was sold for only a few thousand dollars. It was made of stone and was not in bad shape. It is still there. I think it is just offices now. I dont know how local governments get by with this kind of insider selling. "
"This is what happened when the Soviet Union collapsed; insiders under-valued state companies, then bought them at low prices. In addition, they then hired back the former workers, made it profitable again, and sold it for massive profits, mainly since they were the only business in town (monopoly). Then they used their connections in government to keep out competition. "
"Good. Hope he drags her down with him. Scum, both of them."
Oh what a fucking surprise! 
"While the reporters claimed findings definitely sound shady, this line part of the story is pretty ridiculous: &gt;But email is not the problem and the budget deficit is easy enough to fix, so there must be other reasons for the forced sales, say save-the-post-office activists. The post office is being killed for political reasons, they assert, pointing out that the corporation with the exclusive contract to negotiate sales for the Postal Services $85 billion real estate portfolio is C.B. Richard Ellis (CBRE). Hes essentially implying that all of Congress is conspiring to privatize the USPS so that Diane Feinsteins husband can make money. Right... Its being slowly bled to death because Republicans incessantly hammer the budget issue because its an easy target, and the Democrats arent going to use political capital over it. Feinsteins husband may be improperly taking advantage of the situation, but its still definitely true that the USPS is struggling to stay relevant from the pressures of technology and slashing government services. The government should continue fully funding it because its a vital public service, but instead they will string it along with a broken leg just like Amtrak."
"Pity even this wont be enough to get the hateful waste of oxygen that is Diane Feinstein out of office in her next bid for re-election, most likely."
Isnt this the same woman who wants to disarm people because THINK OF THE CHILDREN?
"Diane Feinstein is the Cuntasaurus Rex of California. I swear, she should have been booted out of office about 3 million years ago."
&gt;But email is not the problem and the budget deficit is easy enough to fix oh CA...
Doesnt matter. Those laws only apply to the little people. 
"I love how the article quotes protestors and subtly suggests that privatization is the problem when in fact, its the man tied to one of the most corrupt people in the most corrupt party. Dianne Feinstein(D)."
YOU CAN BUY POST OFFICES?! FUCK! Ive wasted so much time! 
"Well, that sheds a little light on the *real* reason she doesnt want the commoners having firearms. When they rise up against her &amp; her ilk, shits gonna get nasty."
I hope this blows up and casts light on how the Post Office has been thrown under the bus by the Republicans.
Its so unfortunate she won the seat in 1992. And kept it in 1994 by only 2%. Damnit California and youre meant to be the progressive state.
Nothing much left for the rich to buy except the courts.
"Prediction: Rich and powerful doesnt go to jail. You and I, the poor, flip the bill."
"i thought her husband was a defense contractor, not a real estate agent."
This is some bad-ass investigative reporting. Frankly Im a little surprised the east bay Express has the cohones to publish it. BRAVO. 
So the husband of the traitor is a criminal? Somehow Im still not convinced California will have the brains to vote her out.

She is the reason califonia is in the shitter. I guess progress will come in california every time a hippie dies.
"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/going-postal/Content?oid=3713528 Diane Feinsteins husband involved in major post office selling scandal. The husband of US Senator Dianne Feinstein has been selling post offices to his friends, cheap... "
"&lt;Oprah&gt; You get a post office, and you get a post office, and you get a post office!!!"
"What you need to be asking yourself is who are you to question my ethics? I am a well respected long time Senator and former mayor of the greatest city in the world, San Francisco. My husband, a pillar of the community, shares my ethics. You mere citizens do not realize how much I have tried to do for you. I have attempted to remove firearms from the hands of potential criminals. I have attempted to help regulate the internet so that it is fairer for all. I am also attempting to shutdown these con artists in the Conservative media so that you, the lowly citizen, will receive honest, progressive news (after all, the truth has a hard left liberal bias). Ive helped expand the grasp of the NSA to help root out terrorists and malcontents who are a threat to our safety and wellbeing. Yet, having done all these things for you, this is the thanks I get. The fact that you decry my, and my husbands, sacrifices says more about you than it does about us. Ill content with the rights weve allowed you, you whine like children when you dont get your (self destructive) way. This causes you, the unwashed masses, to be viewed poorly and your behavior is insulting to your rulers. In summation, you are all on a list. "
"15 years ago, the city (population 120,000) I used to mail letters from had 16 mail boxes in front of the post office, and many times, all boxes were full. Today, 4 always empty boxes in front. The enormous building, which is being sold, is hideously out of date, and historical, so the city will limit what can be done with it. Thats why they are going cheaply. I looked at buying it, but no way. "
"Diane Feinstein symbolizes everything that is wrong with the Democratic Party, hell, party politics in general. Fun fact, the USPS is one of the few legit governmental organizations actually named in the United States Constitution. Edit: Better? "
"LOL. I had a gut feeling that rat was dirty, just like most all of them congress critters."
Doesnt she sit on different committees and award her husband huge multi-million dollar contracts?
Can we please recall this bitch from office now?
We need term limits on Congress to help prevent this kind of criminal corruption. 
she shouldve been voted out last term. 
This guy was also magically involved in winning California high speed rail contracts: http://calwatchdog.com/2013/04/26/se-diane-feinsteins-husband-wins-ca-rail-contract/
This cunts beard also got the bullshit bullet train construction contract
"If the Post Office is bankrupt it is because Congress bankrupted it. The set an impossible mandate on the Post Office to fund health care and pensions for people who havent even been born yet. They had to fund 75 years into the future and they had to do it within 10 years, AND they could not control the money. They had to give it to the govt to manage, which means that Congress robbed that money. Everything wrong with American today, can be summed up in one evil word - CONGRESS. Congress deregulated banks, Congress de-funded the EPA and FDA, Congress set this impossible unprecedented mandate on the Post Office in a willful effort to bust the Post Office and turn it over to private corporations. "
The New York Times will have a field day with this. Boy do I feel sorry for her and her husband.
"Sounds fishy. But think about it, who is left to buy it besides the fat cats if it does happen to go up for sale. Like anyone else besides the politicians bribers are left to buy anything? If you let the politicians be bought out, if you cant stop that, the rest is just a footnote."
"Okay, I know this is cheesy. Look up pictures of Feinstein and the professor umbridge from Harry potter.. Cant ever look at her the same way."
"Gee, no corruption here that they should both being locked the fuck up in prison for!"
Glad she is on the front lines telling g the American people to get rid of the 2nd amendment
Im sure shell be reelected because we are a nation of idiots.
"But email is not the problem and the budget deficit is easy enough to fix. Boy, never heard that one before. This genius obviously needs to be running the past office."
Vote the feinsteins out of politics
"Wasnt her husband part of the company that won the low bid on the railway too? Edit: [Tutor Perini](http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130820-905529.html) won the bid on the contract. Her husband was no longer associated to this organization apparently but I cant find a date when he left. Although that does seem convenient for them to be able to win the lowest bid with possible inside information. So not guilty, but suspicious."
Dirt bag bitch is my congresswoman. Go figure shes even more of a pig than I thought. Typical of anyone in government IMO. Just more proof the US is a piece of shit! Fuck this country!
WHO FUCKING CARES!? WHAT THE FUCK IS A POST OFFICE?? AND WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THAT GUYS HEAD?
"As a liberal Democrat, I am not a big fan of Dianne Feinstein, but come on, if this was a REPUBLICAN doing this it would not be considered news - it would be considered business as usual. "
"We love Feinstein in the S.F. bay area. Her husband too. Shes been excellent, and we appreciate her service to America. Thanks Diane for your tireless and intelligent work over all these years. Especially a huge thank-you for her efforts towards gun-control."
Am I mistaken or did neither the link nor the title of this post note Feinsteins party affiliation (Democrat)? It seems odd in light of all of the Republican senator this and GOP Congressman that I have seen around here.
This is absolutely disgusting. How could anybody do this? What sort of person uses the adjective cheap when they should use the adverb cheaply? Im done with politics now. 
Being a Democrat means never having to say youre sorry.
Some of us are more equal. 
I think the real issue here is that someone would choose to buy a post office these days...
Heres hoping that nature takes its course and she croaks. 
at least we know why she is going after the Internet and guns... boy was i had i use to be a democrat.
Welcome to the free market. Now shut up and sell us your land or we will have to arrest you on charges we lobbied to become law so we could arrest you and seize your land.
"Honestly, who would want to be married to that bitch."
I wonder if Feinstein would consider East Bay Express to be journalists?
Sweet. Can I buy a post office?
They care about the middle class
"Oh, vey! More anti-Semetism! Just because she and her husband are Zionist Jews who support Israel you anti-Semites must drag her through the mud with slander like Hitler did to the Jews before throwing them into the gas chambers. You naughty, naughty goyim. Shalom, from Israel."
"Ive been wondering if now is the right time to challenge the state law prohibiting recall efforts against federal officials. The precedent has already been set, the law itself isnt ironclad, and Feinstein would be an amazing rallying point"
lol maybe she should stop worrying about assault weapons
Guess I know what will be on Fox News 24/7 for the next few weeks. 
TIL you can buy a post office
"What do you expect from someone with a name like Feinstein? The jew has had its slimy tentacles in just about every subversion and underhanded manipulation of politics, legal systems, and economies since the dawn of time."
Cant say Ill miss Feinstein. A dem will still be elected (however much I hate my options in california) so were fine.
"whenever you see an idiot in power, watch how stupid their actions are."
"Its funny because if this were a republican senator, this wouldnt even make the front page. The point of my post is that democrats are quick to skewer their own when suspect of wrongdoing. Republicans *never* skewer their own. Ever. And regardless of how many moans and cries of how liberal reddit is, the truth will *always* be this: Huge armies of people instantly downvoting anything anti-republican, along with some people who will upvote specifically because it is anti-republican and an army of people trying to shut down any story about progress. THAT *is* reddit these days. Democrats always lose because theyre smart enough to call someone out, even in their own party. They bring knives to gun fights with the republicans. They *always, always* lose. I think those days are coming to an end shortly but goddamn if the democratic party isnt trying everything humanly possible to derail themselves. The positive aspect? They really are (on the whole) looking for some justice and some truth. The republican party? Absolutely not. They seem wholly incapable of grasping the truth...certainly they are almost totally averse to the idea of the truth at all at this point."
Feinstein is a corporate criminal whose anti-gun lobby is rife with white collar felons.

This bitch is really ruining the democratic party name. Its almost like she works for fox news and is giving them the ratings they need with this type of shit.
"Slap on the wrist. The rich make mistakes, the poor go to jail."
"This is about a ranking Democrat. We shouldnt be spreading news like this. Instead, talk about the failings of Republican politicians."
I read Post Office scandal and just assumed he was making counterfeit stamps ...
United Corrupt States of America
Theyd be flush with cash if they charged foreign lottery scammers a price that reflects the damage they do to the bank accounts of unsuspecting senior citizens.
"The article makes note of the 2006 legislation which is causing the USPS to go bankrupt, e.g., forcing it to fund retirement payments 75 years into the future. It implies this is all part of the big scheme by Feinstein to force more business to FedEx, UPS, etc.. It never once mentions that this was Republican legislation to privatize the Post Office, not Democratic. Can you say hatchet job? "
"Why isnt (D, CA) anywhere in this article? This is an example of media bias."
"And nothing will happen, and nobody will care... yay America :("
"Maybe he sells them to people he thinks are slightly off mentally, that way, when they go postal its just more fodder for Feinsteins war against guns."
"Yep been saying it for a while. There is a reason the post office is going broke meme is being pushed for the last few years.... the GAO reports do jot show insolvency but if the tail can wag the dog hard enough ....nice realestate cheap. Total bag of dicks, the both of them."
Good. Fuck this constitutional rights destroying jewbitch. 
That old bat is still at it?
I parsed post office totally wrong in the first line. 
Remove that fossilized cunt!
Republicans..... amirite?
Well maybe this will at last get that AIPAC shill out of office.
Wake up and smell the fascism. 
"Lets not forget the reason post offices are being sold in the first place. Republicans required the USPS to fund pensions at a higher rate than any large corporation has to, they are basically having to fund pensions for employees they havent even hired yet. This cooking of the books was so they could say the post office was going broke and then privatize it to their rich friends. "
Ultimately our politicians are a mirror of our society. And its an ugly image!

A Jew? Involved in corruption??? NO WAY
"Ill repost this response to this Feinstein crap, again here. My contention with the article is that it doesnt give credible enough proof that CBRE has actually been selling the properties for less than they were worth at the time. I hate Feinstein as much as the next rational person. I did, however, somewhat defend the decision to choose CBRE to dispose of the PO properties as they are on anyones list of companies to do the same in the private sector. However, having CBRE do the appraisals and then sell the properties is complete bullshit, if true. There is no way whatsoever that that is an acceptable practice. OTOH, some of the charges in the article are specious: * CBRE appears to have repeatedly violated its contractual duty to sell postal properties at or above fair market values. Not sure anyone is going to be selling much property above Fair market value. Determining FMV in 2010 and 2011 is a crapshoot, especially for special use type property, office buildings are a little easier, but if a major or 100% tenant is moving-out, determining absorption rates in that market is not a science. * CBRE has been paid commissions as high as 6 percent by the Postal Service for representing both the seller and the buyer in many of the negotiations, thereby raising serious questions as to whether CBRE was doing its best to obtain the highest price possible for the Postal Service. This is standard industry practice, perhaps even a bit light for commercial transactions. * CBRE has sold valuable postal properties to developers at prices that appear to have been steeply discounted from fair market values, resulting in the loss of tens of millions of dollars in public revenue. That is clearly a guess, by their own admission as they dont have the appraisals and in most markets assessed value =/= FMV. * In a series of apparently non-arm?s-length transactions, CBRE negotiated the sale of postal properties all around the country to its own clients and business partners, including to one of its corporate owners, Goldman Sachs Group. * Senator Feinstein has lobbied the Postmaster General on behalf of a redevelopment project in which her husband?s company was involved. Those two stink. * By way of explanation, an assessed value is normally based upon the most recent sales price of a parcel, which is likely to be less than its current fair market value. Those are not necessarily true, either the independent or dependent clauses, especially in the worst real estate market in generations. * When there is shortage of commercial real estate in developable areas ? which has been the general situation, nationwide, for several years ? demand tends to push prices far higher than assessed values. There is almost always a shortage of developable areas in a downtown, but demand only pushes prices higher when there is, in fact, demand. Again, 2010-2011, are horrible years for real estate demand in most markets. Someone in this thread mentioned that the NYT is going to have a field day with all this. I would love to see it, whether the field day is about CBRE corruption or a poor smear attempt - Ill wait to see. Cant hurt to vote Feinstein out in the meantime, though. *ed: formatting "
It is not a scandal when everyone knows she is corrupt and everyone knows she should have been kicked out years ago.

"Screw the fucking post office union jobs. Your fucking union contract sets you bastards up above the civilians in the eyes of the law. You get by with things that everyone else goes to jail for, so get fucked and go to hell."

"This is a political hit piece , done by the NRA gun lobbyists, on Diane Fienstien because shes wants gun regulations."

Any bad news for Diane Feinstein brings sunshine to my day. 
This story is completely idiotic. The US post office has been in the red since its inception. Our tax money has been keeping it afloat. We are better off privatizing all of it.
&gt;And 80 percent of the Postal Services multibillion-dollar deficit is caused by a law passed by Congress in 2006 that requires it to prepay retiree health benefits **75 years into the future**. Said benefit fund being slated to be taken over by the contractor?minus a teeny-tiny annual management fee?when the USPS is outright privatized.
As a former S.F. Resident I am amazed that people vote that hideous bitch into office. She and her husband are among the leading slumlords in S.F. Look up the meaning of Self Serving and you will see her picture.
"Im surprised this is actually getting media attention. Feinstein and her husband have made a fortune out of leveraging public assets and contracts for their private investments, and have done so blatantly for years. The term conflict of interest is synonymous with easy money for these people."
Ive just grown so weary of hearing about these filthy scumbags taking advantage of their position as those *in humble service to their constituents.* Dirtbags...they should be shot. In an official sense. To make the others fear. Edit: Pretty extreme view in hindsight but its just so frustrating to see this incredible corruption just get repeated week after week and all they have to do is resign and skate off to a cush Board position when us working stiffs have to walk the line on pins and needles to avoid hard time.
Does this mean we can finally try and get a Democrat in the office?
"People need to get up, get out of their houses (get off Reddit) and take to the streets. Go **stand and protest** in front of your local city or state government offices. Tell your friends youre protesting, middle class, educated people, dressed well, standing up and saying, this is broken and needs to stop. There are major nationwide events happening Oct 26 for awareness about spying (stopwatching.us) and Nov 5, for awareness about government corruption. "
You want Feinstein gone? AIPAC laughs in your general direction.
The only thing I believe will stop thus kind if behavior is to restrict the politicians to one term and make them follow the same laws that they pass for the citizens.
What can we do to stop this? It would be one thing if they couldnt make enough to stay in operation but making them pay pensions 75 years in the future is ridiculous. I have amazon prime and hate that they use UPS and not the U.S. post office
Which of our public assets will be privatized next? speakers asked. Streets? Schools? The Lincoln Bedroom?
I smell Jews.
it important to know how these great men lived. We try to vote in perfection which doesnt exist. We end up with a govt like we have today.
People and human nature have not changed even a little bit. The only thing that has changed is technology. 
"Ok, so explain to me how the 1st Amendment shouldnt apply to the Internet."
"Mass shootings? I suggest you look up the number of gun-related deaths per annum for the US... Then the deaths caused by tobacco. Or even by car crashes. Guns are fairly irrelevant. Unfortunately, people like to sensationalize."
"Because they wrote the Constitution and all of the USs formative documents. Anyone who has taken even a basic English class would be able to tell that it is incredibly important to read material through the lens of the author. Their opinions are still relevant today because their documents are still fundamental to our political structure. Disregarding their opinions could potentially devalue hundreds of years of legal interpretation. Plus, even if their opinions are hundreds of years old and contextually out of touch, much of what they say is still relevant and applicable to today. "
"I have a house loaded with guns and ammo of all kinds. Not only has no one ever been hurt or killed, but my guns have been used to defend my family during a break in. Stop blaming the inanimate object/tool for the bad choices made by people. "
"I think this is a dangerous attitude to have. Should we get rid of the 1st amendment because of how powerful social media is? The founding fathers definitely did not imagine telephones, TV or let alone the internet when they were writing the Constitution. The situation may have changed but people do not. I think it is incredibility ignorant to disregard something as irrelevant just because something is IN THE PAST. That is not how history or let alone the world works. "
&gt; If people swear up and down that guns are safe Who swears that? Edit: I suppose I should have asked Who swears that they are safe for the reason stated? My bad.
"The truth is that many of the self-dubbed Patriots that lurk on the extreme American Right are Neo-Confederates. They fantasize about overthrowing the Federal Government and instilling some sort of Evangelical militia-fetal paradise. This is why theyve appropriated gross distortions of Colonial and Early American Republic and wrapped themselves in it. They cant really get away with their The South was Right!!!1! bullcrap anymore in decent society, so they have to find other graves to plunder. Of course, theres no way these Patriots can wrap themselves in Confederate Gray and the Stars and Bars anymore and be taken seriously. But God knows, [some still try to get away with it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEC68vTQwP8)"
They wrote the Constitution to put limits on government because people are assholes. People are still assholes. 
"Honestly, who cares about the founding fathers anymore? They were important for what they did IN THE PAST, but people get far to entrenched in debating what would the founding fathers do. Bottom line is that it doesnt matter what they would do, because its 2013 not 1787. The country needs to adapt to ever changing situations and be flexible enough to realize that we dont live in the same world that the founding fathers did. If people swear up and down that guns are safe because the founding fathers said we should have them even in the face of mass shooting after mass shooting, we have a problem (which we do)"
[deleted]
Who cares about history anymore? Not me.
Thats not what I am trying to say. My point is that people cling to things that are outdated and dont really have a positive influence in the way the world works today. 
" I agree with this to a degree. It is a different time with different issues, and the original laws dont stand; in most cases. But it is important to remember the ideology this country is founded on. Its not straight democracy, a dictatorship, a fiefdom, or whatever-else. The founding fathers debated what it should be, until they came to the decision that a government should guarantee as many liberties as possible without endangering the rest of the populous. It was perhaps the most forward thinking political philosophy of the time (dont give me shit about the Magna Carta, it was important as well, but it became important years after it was written). My point is, its important not to come to rash decisions. Its not likely that anyone (intelligent) would do this, but suppose was voted in that guns could be sold by anyone, anywhere. That goes directly against this founding philosophy, as it can very easily endanger people. Making guns illegal would very easily endanger a liberty. Again, I cant stress enough that youre right about the same laws not applying. But I tell you, the philosophy does. In a time where our country is weakened by bureaucracy, debt, and corruption, the only redeeming advantage is our bill of rights and our founding philosophy. NOTE: Dont ask me about the gun control issue. Its a complicated matter with no real, solid answer."
Smoking tobacco until you die is a personal choice. Being shot to death by someone with legally purchased weapons is not. Guns are not irrelevant and they are not a sensation. They are a problem that we must deal with.
Thank you.
Same goes for the tradeoff of personal freedom and privacy. Its 2013. We live in a world of suitcase nukes and dirty bombs that can make cities uninhabitable. I would gladly trade some privacy for safety. All the founding fathers had to worry about were muskets and bayonets.

"Common sense seems to be in short supply, obviously."
"We have the First Amendment to speak freely, think freely, assemble freely, and expand our freedoms freely all without fear of punishment (but there are logical limitations like how you cant yell fire in a theater or bomb on a plane). We have the Second Amendment to protect the first. The right to bear arms is a law of rebellion against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The founding fathers couldnt predict full autos, and I support FAWB because why would we need a full auto to begin with? - to fight the corrupt government? Yeah... about that... the military trains their soldiers to fire one shot at a time; the infantry hardly use fully automatic weapons. So, to get rid of the AR-15, a semi automatic rifle, because it is occasionally used by mass murderers is an illogical atrocity used by self-serving politicians to gain brownie points off of a terrified populace. FBI crime stats show a decrease in violent crime over the last several decades; most violent crime is perpetrated by *hand guns, not rifles*. Therefore, if anything was to be banned, it should be hand guns. But theres no media cry to ban them; theres no congressmen talking about banning pistols; and even when they are banned (like in Chicago and DC), it doesnt stop criminals anyways. Guns arent safe. Nobody with any sense swears that. But people kill people, guns are just a tool. And theyre being scapegoated by a society hellbent on banning them because its politically convenient, when in actuality the mental health of every shooter needs to be examined *and* we need to get *that* in check. **TL;DR** - Guns are tools; people need their heads examined; handguns are used to kill more than AR-15s; dont ban AR-15s because CNN shows politicians saying we need to ban AR-15s especially when the stats dont support the claim. Sources: http://www.policymic.com/articles/23170/gun-control-facts-homicides-and-violent-crime-have-dropped-50-over-the-last-20-years http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/05/06/the-firearms-statistics-that-gun-control-advocates-dont-want-to-see/ http://www.factcheck.org/2012/12/gun-rhetoric-vs-gun-facts/ The point is that the rhetoric doesnt match up to the stats; and, in the case of the horrid VT shooting, there was no *real* call for more control because he followed the existing gun laws and purchased what was legally available. Horrible, but another argument against the rhetoric. And if you really want your mind blown: one of the weapons used at Columbine was the [Hi-Point Carbine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Point_Carbine), which was designed in accordance with the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban passed under Slick Willy (I miss the days when a blowjob was our messiest problem - bazinga). Second **TL;DR** - Im also sick and tired of people saying its not 1787, so lets stop being in love with the Founding Fathers and the 2nd Amendment. My response: We have the 1st to protect the rest; the 2nd to ensure we keep the first."
But. But. But..... Think of all the straw man arguments that wont be made if we dont invoke the fantasy of the saintly founding fathers!
"Again, Im not saying the constitution is bad, but we simply need not bind ourselves to a 200+ year old line of thinking. Since you brought it up, yes homosexuals are humans too and deserve the same rights as everyone else. Nobody mentioned pedophilia except for you, so what are you getting at with this? And since I brought up adhering to ancient lines of thinking, yes, I think religion is a little silly when people like you use it to bludgeon any sort of progressive thinking that doesnt prescribe to gods word.

"Really, how long did Bin Laden work for the CIA? Do you have evidence of this? No, of course you dont, since [he never actually worked for the CIA](http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2009/05/20090505134735atlahtnevel0.5280725.html#axzz2K9i25jAI)."
Why is this lie being upvoted? The CIA never funded Osama. Its a myth.
and they killed Gheddafi before anyone had the chance to know what he knew...
"yea, being given money in exchange for services is working for someone. "
[your tinfoil is showing](http://factcheck.org/2013/02/rand-pauls-bin-laden-claim-is-urban-myth/)
Ill just leave this here: http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/
"Bin Laden was a CIA asset for years, even the CIA has admitted to using him during the USSR war with Afghanistan. Do some research dumbass. "
I think my tinfoil has come loose.
Considering how long he worked for the CIA it is no surprise he knew what was coming. 
"How long, exactly, did he work for the CIA? You make it sound like Osama was attending weekly staff meetings in Langley when he, maybe, accepted arms and money through the filter of the ISI,"
"He never worked for the CIA he worked with them. He was funded and trained by CIA operatives during the USSR Invasion of Afghanistan. That would be like me saying I studied at MIT because I read a book on their campus. Or like saying Communist and Republican China work for the US since back in the 1920s they received weapons, material, funding, and training tenfold that of bin Ladens forces (including the whole of the Mujahadeen)"
I dont believe they are now but if the minimum wage was to be increased to the $10.75 it should be based off the inflation premise previously stated then it is very likely that they would enter a tax bracket that results in an income tax.
"I think city, state, and national economy is what we are going for."
You think that people who are making minimum wage pay any sort of income taxes? Are you fucking kidding me?
"&gt; it would have the added benefit of adding additional taxes [Hahaha](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/11/americans-paying-no-taxes/) But Im sure redditors will jump in to point out that those people pay sales taxes, so that extra $50 a year will surely boost global economy."
I can agree that a minimum wage that goes back to the 86 increase and adjusts it to inflation would make just as much sense as a middle class tax cut. Both seem like good ways to create more spending capital for average citizens. And in the case of raising minimum wage it would have the added benefit of adding additional taxes to our system since income tax would get a few extra billion for the government. Maybe doing both in tandem you would produce a net zero situation where the extra money in from raised minimum wage would pay for the tax cut to the middle class.
"Something you rarely see in this conversation is why is birth control (abortion or not) covered by health insurance. Most women dont need birth control pills to be healthy. Just like most men dont need condoms to be healthy, which is why condoms are not covered by insurance. "
Please tell me about men who need [penis pumps](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/24/ilyse-hogue/look-medicares-grossly-excessive-spending-penis-pu/) to be healthy.
"Actually, the majority of women who take birth control take it for reasons other than to prevent pregnancy. Birth control is also used for medical conditions or managing painful periods. Birth control absolutely treats health. Condoms, not so much. "
"OK so **some** women need this pill to be healthy just like some women need cholesterol meds to be healthy, but does it make sense for cholesterol drugs to be covered for **all** women who regardless of their need for the drug? BTW? I am all for Obamacare and minimum insurance requirements but this one doesnt make sense to me, which is why I asked. "
"I dont think penis pumps should be included in the federal govt.s minimum coverage requirements either. If someone wants to insure themselves above and beyond the govt minimums to cover things like penis pumps, condoms, or birth control pills that seems perfectly reasonable but it doesnt make sense that the federal govt require the minimum coverage requirements to include any of these as they do not keep people healthy or prevent illness. "
"Oh by the way, the money the republicans turned down... **[Report: Florida Medicaid expansion could create 71,300 jobs](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/report-florida-medicaid-expansion-could-create-71300-jobs/1275894)** Expended health care for your citizens AND job creation. Pffffft, who wants that?"
This is the proper response to bullshit like this. 
"I just want to clear something up. While technically you are correct that medicaid is for the poor, I want to remind people that we have become poor because we got sick and we unable to work. For me it was cancer. I had to leave my web dev job. But because I made too much money when I did work, the disability they determined I could would be getting was too high and I was deemed unable to get medicaid. But if I was able, it wasnt because I was some poor schmuck using the system. Anyone can get sick and in the blink of an eye need health coverage. On disability you can get medicare but only after 24 months being on disability. Shocked that we arent treating the actual disease that causes people to be disabled? Yeah me too. I spend 100% of my disability on my cancer treatments. How much does that leave me to live on? ZERO. Luckily in VA i was able to get a tax credit to apply to obamacare and only have to pay a few hundred for insurance and then I will have money to live on. The whole system, not just florida, is riddled with flaws. They arent helping people. They want to see us die. "
Rick Scott may be the least ethical and biggest piece of shit out there.
"There is a very simple solution to this problem: Vote Rick Scott out of office. The former governor, Charlie Crist, is running as a Democrat now. He may be a moderate Democrat, but at least hes sensible enough to see how the Medicaid expansion saves lives, creates jobs, and helps people."
"We might as well consider FDR a prophet since he pointed out this [SSDD Conservative behavior back in 1936](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUZGkNAUSvY), no less. The faces may have changed in the Conservative movement over the years, but the under handed, anti-American behavior coming from it hasnt. "
&gt;implying that locking potential immigrants out of the country to allow extorted benefits for people in the 90th percentile of global income is good for the poor 
"And with no political fallout. Impoverished, uncovered Floridians are probably *proud* of the fact that they dont have healthcare, up to and including the moment some preventable disease kills them prematurely. They were so worried about imaginary Obama deathcamps, they let the GOP murder them. "
"Swift mocked the cruel indifference of the rich with the suggestion that they eat poor Irish babies. His stories showed people as giants to exaggerate human blemishes. They showed people as tiny figures, to demonstrate how trivial were their problems. He showed humans as idiot animals working for cultured horses. Swift was a complete misanthropist; he despised human beings. Nothing evil they did could surprise him. But even Swift would be revolted at the *pointless* cruelty with which the well-off American regards the poor American. To deny health care to hundreds of thousands of your own people, for no point but spite? Even Swift would gag. "
"The GOP philosophy, we got away with murdering the 99% again and were still getting reelected, SCORE!!!"
"The Tampa Bay Times (formerly St Petersburg Times) have won numerous pulitzers.

It is one of the best papers in the country. "
"Its worse in Georgia. They passed a bill that prevents medicaid expansion. They effectively told 400,000 uninsured Georgians they were too poor to have health care."
"Yea, I think this will make a great blueprint for campaign ads come election season. "
"Nebraska checking in here. We failed to expand Medicaid too. Whats horrible to me is that it was filibustered. There was a vote 27-21 in favor of ending the filibuster, but 33 votes are needed to end the filibuster. How the fuck does that make sense? How is that democracy? The majority of the state senators want to pass legislation and they cannot. Our system is broken. The Republican party. The party of Jesus. Do you think Jesus would be in favor of the poor having access to health care? Gee. I fucking wonder. "
"Wow. That article was direct, clear, and damned brutal. Not as brutal as denying 3/4ths of a million Floridians basic health care out of idiot political spite and general contempt for the poor. But, still, brutal. *corrected for grammar and increased sense of outrage*"
Such a waste of poor people. Swift would be appalled. 
"Im one of these people. When I lost my job in February, I lost my insurance (COBRA is a joke). Being a part-time student, my disposable income went toward tuition in January. Now I have no options for medical care since Im at that point where Im poor but not poor enough. I had to move in with family and am making plans to move back to Seattle for better work opportunity. Ill just have to finish my degree at a later time in my life. It sucks because Im very smart, and a very good employee, but circumstances will always dictate how successful I am due to things like this. TL;DR Fuck Florida. Im out."
"A community that does not dare to invest in its members, is weak. A nation that lacks the wisdom to see that health and education are necessary investments in its own prosperity, will fail. Those who quack to the world how they pulled themselves up by their own umbilical cord, beholden to no man for their prosperity? are merely fearful that *prosperity for others, may mean less for themselves.* "
"Your point is important. The 2008 crash began in the mortgage industry. The 2nd most common reason for mortgage default, was medical bills. Michael Moores movie Sicko was not about people without insurance. It was about people who had jobs, and homes, and insurance, and still went bankrupt and homeless when they became too ill to work, when bills ate up their lives. The Affordable Care Act is a weird idiot hybrid of mostly *conservative* solutions to begin to address the problem. They have No. Slightest. Rational. Reason. to oppose it. "
They should be brutal people are going to die as a direct result of this its absolutely disgusting.
Just another reason to stay out of florida. 
"Conservatives have two messages for America. DEMOCRATS LIE. DONT VOTE DEMOCRAT. and ALL POLITICIANS LIE. DONt VOTE. Two messages, one intent: *dont let Americans realize they can use government to solve problems.* "

You guys have nothing to worry about. I also fall into this gap. I have composed many emails and have been promised health care. You just need to wait. The money is going to public services anyway. They are after all the goverment. They are meant to take care of us.

"&gt;From your article, it looks like Medicare is no less susceptible to fraud than the rest of it.&lt; link? This is still just your assertion. It says nowhere that there is more fraud among private insurance companies than Medicare. You still havent answererd my original question &gt;You are pretty sure there will be plenty of funds? Do you have a link to back that up? The government has cut Medicare so it is on an unsustainable path as of now.&lt; How is Medicare supposed to cover every US citizen if the President has been cutting funding to the program? "
"if you read just above what I wrote, but here it is again: &gt;Put another way, the nature of the American health care system lends itself to a certain level of fraud, and the Medicare program is no more and no less susceptible to this type of crime. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/17/peter-roskam/rep-roskam-says-medicare-fraud-rate-8-10-percent/ &lt;-- GO HERE!!!!!! &gt;How is Medicare supposed to cover every US citizen if the President has been cutting funding to the program? What are you talking about? Please provide source for this. The only people who want to cut benefits are GOP. You should read Rayans budget. [ In **2014 States that expand Medicaid will increase eligibility levels to 138% of the Federal Poverty Line ($23,550 for a family of four). ...About half of the uninsured in America would be covered by Medicaid Expansion.** ](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacares-medicaid-expansion.php) Under ACA, medicaid will be expanded in many states. The tab for the expansion will be covered 100% for the first 3 years and 95% after that. The states that chose not to expand medicare are throwing money away. And what I said originally, if instead of paying money to insurance companies, but paying into medicare/medicaid, there will be more than enough to cover everyone. "
Increasing revenues works.
We could you know...increase revenue. That could help reduce the debit. Just throwing that wild idea out there! (But honestly I think it should be a little of each)
"the problem isnt the notion of reducing spending, but *what we reduce spending on.* The GOP seem very willing to take food out of the mouths of poor children to cut spending but not a dime from a 600 billion dollar defense budget. It starts to become rather hard to take their call of desperation seriously."
So your solution is higher taxes? Do you think we should cut spending at all? 
"&gt;under clinton we had 4 years of very real surplus, counting SS surplus or not, and clinton paid down 600 billion of our debt. The situation 20 years ago is different than it is today. &gt;?personally i think a congress and president that produces a surplus and pays down debt, should get an award, not a straightjacket. But that hasnt happened, quite the opposite. &gt;since 2006 we had a mega recession, this caused a dramatic rise in debt and deficit, as government services get used by more people while revenues from taxes dropped as businesses and people make less money. Doubling and maintaining the DoD budget didnt help either. Neither did the expansion of the surveillance state under TSA/DHS/NSA, etc. The only people talking about reducing or gutting those departments are dismissed as crazy. &gt;also many of the bush tax cuts were made perm and obama added some tax cuts on top of that. This precludes us from getting back to surplus. So the spending issue sounds like a bipartisan problem. And neither will we ever have a surplus if the small token cuts are surpassed by increases in the interest payments spent towards the debt. Infact, the best solution theyve come up in their minds so far is instead of cuts is to increase spending more slowly. &gt;The main new spending we have done is Obamacare, but that actually reduces our overall deficit because it is funded by changing the way we do things as well as taxes on Cadillac plans. That is yet to be seen. It could save or cost us hundreds of billions. &gt;once revenues are back to the levels of 1999 and perhaps cutting military spending back to 1999 levels adjusted for inflation, we will be back to surplus again. So lets go ahead and cut military spending. Obama would receive a high five from me for publically suggesting this. But he wont, hasnt and has only expanded our military operations. While not as heavily involved in Iraq and Afganistan, weve now got many more smaller conflicts were involved in, funding, arming or supporting. &gt;WE really dont have a debt problem, our gdp growth is faster than our debt growth.(except during the initial part of the recession) Debt has surpassed 100% of gdp and is growing. So no, our GDP growth is not faster than our debt growth. So we absolutely have a debt problem, and the credit card is getting close to be saturated. Which is troubling if you consider what would happen if we had an emergency. "
"There is so much propaganda on both sides, but the fact is how do we ever reduce the debt if we dont reduce spending?"
"Well, increasing income does help when faced with trying to balance outlays from a financial perspective. But personally, Ive got a bit of an issue with governments inefficient use of my tax dollars with so much going towards war and interest on debt. Ive got no qualm with roads, schools, public works, etc and will gladly pay those taxes, its the funding being used for war thousands of miles away, bailouts, interest on ever increasing debt, etc. that Ive got a problem with. &gt;(But honestly I think it should be a little of each) Youre absolutely right, although we might be past the little part, any sensible solution must include a hybrid of policies. The problem is however, growing, so our ability to make little changes might already have passed, with only tough decisions remaining. "

"Some factors to consider, other than the right vs. left rhetoric in this sub are grazing rights, federal ownership of land vs. state ownership, intended purposes for that land, the fact that Sen.

"The only real liberal thing(s) accomplished during Obamas term(s) has been the amount of states allowing gay marriage...and it was his support of gay marriage combined with a refusal to defend DOMA in court that kept the momentum going. Sure, he deserves credit for Sotomayor and Kagan but they replaced liberal justices. I would give him ACA but it was originally a republican plan. Well see how that hobby lobby thing plays out, if they lose their case then Ill give him that, as it likely wasnt part of the original republican plan. Aside from the major advancements on gay marriage and the SCOTUS appointments (that replaced already liberal judges), I cant find anything that particularly advances (meaning tipping the balance in favor of liberals, not partially restoring an already massively unbalanced conservative legacy of Bush) a liberal agenda with him.

Would I be kind-of right because Democrats controlled the house until the midterms 4 years ago? Or would I be completely and utterly, pants on fire wrong? Democrats dont control the House, and havent for 4 years. I should know better, check better, or get out of Congress."

"Im kinda confused why just false, and not pants on fire. Gohmerts percentage for Democrats is wrong by a factor of about two and a half, his percentage for Republicans is wrong by a factor of 3, and the current partisan tilt of investment bankers is the exact opposite of what he claims, with a majority of support going to Republicans, not a supermajority going going to Democrats."

Why would they care about Americans owning guns?
"Good lord. I regret every time I dismissed the theyre going to take away our guns types?if even half of what you say is true, weve got a *huge* fucking problem on our hands."
The UN arms treaty has nothing to do with American guns Its so false that Snopes has even made a post about it http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/untreaty.asp
"I would say its more a huge problem lurking in the background right now. Its not panic-mode yet, and probably wont be for some time, but that this is effectively the UNs plan to control Americas gun legislation (because lets be honest, the vast majority of UN countries already have laws that are as strict or stricter) is spooky enough. Realistically its not something that will probably ever end up applying to the United States - *however*, the fact that the UN is taking shots across the bow at the US, attempting to solve its so-called gun problem for them is what is worrying. As soon as I saw the countries listed on the front cover I went oh this is going to be *great*."

Good misdirection.
"&gt; Libertarians are usually very quick to say that if a corporation does something bad then people will just stop using the companys services. And like many things that Libertarians repeat like truisms - it blatantly ignores the reality around us. Nestle, HSBC, many bigger and smaller cases of Pharmaceutical companies essentially experimenting on people in India, Wallmart being tax-subsidized etc etc. My favourite is of course the claim that if government didnt do anything for people in need, charities would take over. Show me _a_ charity that is not bending over backwards to achieve their goals despite being grossly underfunded. Libertarianism might very well be The Future, an approach that is more sensible than the right/left divide (both American and European iterations). But only in _strongly_ diluted version. Why I say this? Never trust a person who claims absolute statements over matters that have never ever been put into practice full scale, for he is a moron that doesnt understand that the most clever looking plan can crash and burn over the silliest unaccounted for factors. "
"Absolutely. This is one of the reasons I very much support regulation. In a deregulated market, a corporation can get away with many more shenanigans."
"The real problem with this is that it works well on a local scale. Companies know that if they poison the local pond or park theyre done, not to mention that the local CEOs kid swims in the local pond, so its his neck, too. But it most definitely doesnt work in a corporate world where consumers are isolated from the factories that poison the lake thousands of miles away, shareholders dont even know what theyre invested in and are much more concerned about dividends than the troubles somewhere else that might be mentioned by some news outlet in passing (if the news outlets arent all owned by the same parent corp). People are no longer connected to the companies or towns or people who make their goods, so there is no incentive for consumers to punish bad actors in cases like these by taking their business elsewhere, which makes the role of government as protector of the people from corporate greed more important than ever. "
Its easy not to use a corporations services when it screws up on a scale like this - especially when youre dead.
Dont forget that outside of reddit libertarians are a very small nuisance and barely worth mentioning. There are only 325 thousand registered libertarians versus 41 million republicans and 43 million democrats. 106 thousand or 33% of all libertarians are subscribed to /r/libertarian/. That would be like /r/democrats having 14 million subscribers instead of the current 10 thousand. Those 106 thousand consist of mostly teenagers mixed with couple of thousand white supremacists. They are what fuels the sexism and racism on reddit but in real life they are just a bad joke. [**The Libertarian Party is the third-largest political party in the U.S.** : **FALSE**](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/sep/09/libertarian-party-broward-county/libertarians-say-theyre-third-largest-political-pa/)
Hey! Putting in regulations just kills freedom! We cant have people killing freedom here. 
A more succinct way to put it is this: Would you prefer to (1) have cancer and a million dollar settlement or (2) not have cancer?
Libertarianism does not give you a free pass to destroy other peoples stuff. This company would need to answer to both civil and justice courts. Laws against murder are mostly reactionary as well. The punishment of those found guilty end up serving as a warning to others. Hence ... even 100% reactionary laws serve as proactive prevention to some degree.
"This is actually wrong. Libertarianism is not reactive at all. Its very proactive. There is no right to pollute. Polluting property which does not belong to you is inherently a crime. The problem isnt libertarianism - the problem is corporatism - there is no one who will have cuff slapped on them and personally held responsible for this crime because they are protected by a corporate shield. In a libertarian society, this would be a crime, and there would be people who are held PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE for their criminal actions in this crime, starting with the person who pulled the lever, and working up the chain of command. To imagine that this is some kind of libertarian problem misses the point - this has nothing to do with libertarianism - it doesnt exist. Regulations against this are unnecessary because it is inherently criminal to pollute property that does not belong to you. The regulations exist inherently. Dumping waste into a river is an infringement without the need for regulations. To say that regulations would have prevented this misses the point. An actual system of justice where individuals in corporations are held liable would have prevented this but because theyve signed a piece of paper with the government, the government chooses NOT to hold them accountable - and worse, the government will likely limit their liability. This is not a libertarian problem. This is a government problem."
Coordination problems abound when it comes to pure libertarianism. The Non-Libertarian FAQ: http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html
"Ronald Reagan used to claim that regulations are unnecessary because the threat of lawsuits is enough to keep corporations honest. But corporations regard suits and fines as simply the cost of doing business, and of course their bought-and-paid-for legislators (and corporate justices on the Supreme Court) are always making it harder to sue. To paraphrase the old saying, We have the best government *the highest bidder* can buy."
"On the other side of the coin, if the current government allowed fines required to completely clean up this mess it would in many cases lead to bankruptcy. If the same thing happened to BP, they might potentially go out of business and other companies would think twice about being careless with toxic chemicals. "
I never trust anyone who has that much faith in people running things to not fuck things up without someone looking over their shoulder.
"Libertarians always argue that government is incompetent and cause massive environmental damage. This river is polluted due to lax regulations. Who was lax with their regulating? Government was. If the river was privately owned and operated, it would be cleaner. The worlds biggest single polluting entity in the world today is the US military. Historically, the worlds worst polluter was the now defunct USSR. Private companies cannot hold a candle to the amount of damage to the environment governments have caused. "
"same thing could be said about abortion, in regards to birth control and education."
Why dont you google where duke energy spends their lobbying funds...
"You are absolutely correct. However, it should come as no surprise that many Libertarians take such a position when their beliefs and research are largely fueled/funded by some of the worst corporate polluters in the country...the Koch Brothers. "
Ill just get my coal powered electricity from another coal company! Oh wait. Something something monopoly
&gt;proactive regulation of corporations I dont see how regulation would change the outcome. If anything the corporations will stuff the regulation board to get what they want anyways. Im sure the residents of the area would rather pay a corporation or environmental group directly to monitor the pipelines than put together a regulatory board that isnt accountable to the taxpayers.
"You are on some treacherous ice. Reddit is not the place to bash libertarians. When their mothers wake them up at 2:00 PM after a long night of updating their Illuminati-conspiracy blogs, you are going to be in for a world of hurt. "
"The company should just get their coal ash out of the River... No matter the cost. Thats pretty simple, why dont we make them do that? "
"Besides, the notion that people will stop using the services of a company they dont even know the name of - which is the norm in these cases - is ludicrous. Even when they know its Duke Energy, how the hell are they going to avoid it? Is it even possible to get their power from someone else,and if it is, how massive is the hassle? It would take something incredibly egregious to make people go through all the rigamarole of changing and in many cases its not even possible because people are dealing with monopolies or oligopolies. Those are the expected end result in any sort of capitalism, especially the libertarian approach, so the libertarian fantasy of a reactive system is not even reactive, its a mental fantasy construct that is innately invalid."
"I think the libertarian answer would be that if you see X people died because of a company, those not affected would boycott them in the future for their actions, after that happened a few times no company would need regulation, living in fear of boycotts. When you consider how bad some companies behave though, especially utilities, which cant be easily boycotted, and how many companies either ignore boycotts because they cant reach critical mass, or engage others to counter the boycott (buying extra to make up for it as in Chick-Fil-A or Girl Scout Cookies) it seems that boycotts are very seldom effective enough measures to change anything a company does. The only thing companies are motivated to do by bad press is to try to limit reporting."
Libertarians argue that [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) applies to companies because they are not being shielded from risk and therefore are prone to act responsibly. Of course in practice...lmao
"It works perfectly, thats why people stopped using BP and Walmart."
"My problem with libertarianism is that it is inherently *reactive* when corporations do bad things. Libertarians are usually very quick to say that if a corporation does something bad then people will just stop using the companys services. But that is a *reactive* decision. Which doesnt help if the corporations *killed* you with poison from contaminating the water supply. Contrary to what libertarians would have you believe, there *is* a need for *proactive* regulation of corporations actions in order to *prevent* certain catastrophes from even happening in the first place. "
"Although I agree with this point, its just about the only campaign promise he has attempted to keep, from what I can tell. I voted for the jackass to promote open government, then he decides to prosecute whistleblowers, promote privacy-eroding bills, and give immunity to the very people and corporations who are destroying this country for the highest profit."
Thanks for the post. Ill take a look at those.
"Third party. Yes, it throws away your vote, but that doesnt make it a bad choice. The throw away is only for a single election, but in the larger metagame of voting it can have a positive effect. If the Dems see their constituents leaving to vote for a party that better represents their beliefs, you can bet theyll either change or die."
Now there is a lot more that he kept than that. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-kept/
"And now who do we vote for next time? No way Hillary Clinton would be a better choice for the issues you mentioned, and obviously the Republicans are similarly unsuited. Things are bad."
"Not that it matters in hindsight, but the budget surplus was a product of a Republican Congress working with a second term president. It was not a Democratic achievement, it was an American achievement."
Thats kinda true. The deficit skyrocketed in Obamas first year (I think we all remember his first 100 days in office)... and he has reduced it from the mountain peak he brought it to himself.
"Simple math. The national debt had increased 6.5 Trillion dollars since Obama took office. He has been in office about 5 years at this point. Therefore, the average yearly deficit (money added to the national debt) has been over 1.3 Trillion dollars for every year he has been in office. During Bushs years, the deficit was only about 625 million a year. The debt only rose 1.5 trillion during Clintons entire time in office. I dont see how anybody can even start to argue that Obamas presidency hasnt seen the worst deficits of any president the US has ever had."
And everyone always fails to remember that Bushs last fiscal year was a $1.5 trillion deficit year (2008). The GOP and media conveniently and falsely attribute that as Obamas first year.
"We do NOT want a balanced budget amendment. That is a perfect way to absolutely fuck over an economy long term. A nation needs to be able to borrow money, lots of money, tons of money, during a recession. In a recession, tax revenues plummet and spending needs explode. This is why we had trillion dollar deficits for awhile. With a balanced budget amendment, you cant do that. Your only option is to retain a massive emergency fund, which for an entity the size of the federal government would be $5-10 trillion dollars. Do you really want the government owning that much in assets? Do you really wanting the government owning a significant fraction of the nations stocks and bonds? More importantly, proper emergency funds are almost impossible to maintain politically. As soon as you get a large surplus to start filling them, some demagogue Republican comes riding into office, promising to give the money back to the people!!"
Do the math. Clinton had a surplus. The debt went up under Clinton. Smoke and mirrors.
"I saw a lot of that during the shut down. Lots of Repubs claiming the deficit was rising, quoting trillions of dollars. Conveniently they keep confusing debt and deficit. The debt will continue to rise so long as we keep running a deficit, and will shrink once we have a budget surplus. The thing that drives me crazy is that there was surplus under Clinton. GW wasted no time getting rid of pay go. Started two unfunded wars and a medicaid expansion and a tax cut to boot. Repubs better look themselves in the mirror before pointing fingers elsewhere. Facts show that under rupub rule, deficits increased. Mr Obama has reduced them. Those are simple truths. Id be happy to have a balanced budget amendment. Problem is theres not the political courage cooperate and make hard choices."
"The odds of the US running a budget surplus ever again seem mighty slim. I think the system will crash well before this happens again. The US is not in a growth stage of its life cycle, it is a mature developed economy which should not be looking to grow but to be self sustaining at this time. A constant desire for growth will utterly destroy our ecosystem and it is simply not feasible. When people realise this, a crash will happen because those debts are not getting paid and all will be chaos for a while. After this I hope we take a new direction with the way we view progress- get rid of the capitalist system and focus on needs of all rather than the wants of the priviliged. "
Find a year where Revenue was greater then Spending under Clinton and Ill buy you a month of Gold. GW also inherited a market crash that was responsible for a decent chunk of that debt. He also raised spending but it wasnt entirely his fault.
"&gt; Facts show that under rupub rule, deficits increased. Mr Obama has reduced them. Those are simple truths. Except that those *arent* simple truths. In fact, the second part is a lie. Mr. Obama is running much higher deficits than Bush did. In only one year (the start of the recession) did Bush run higher deficits. The other 7 years, the deficits were much lower. "
Shutting down the govt did raise the deficit slightly.
&gt; The thing that drives me crazy is that there was surplus under Clinton Not really. It was accounting gimmicks so they could use it as a cheap talking point. Dont think for a second it was just because there was more revenue than spending. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/23/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-his-administration-paid-down-deb/
"Wait times are better, oh no more people must be dying then... oh wait... The Commonwealth Fund report shows somewhat fewer reported physician errors, lab errors, medication errors and duplicate tests north of the border, and Canadians report more satisfaction with their doctors. General health is also better up north, according to the World Health Organization: Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy are both higher in Canada; infant mortality is lower, and maternal mortality is significantly lower. There are fewer deaths from non-communicable diseases, cardiovascular diseases and injuries in Canada... http://www.factcheck.org/2007/12/comparing-health-care-in-canada-to-the-us/ Also, your insurance company CANNOT LEGALLY deny my coverage based on my medical needs, which means it doesnt matter what my risk analysis is. And in so far as cost, single payer costs FAR LESS than private insurance, which means if this is PURELY a matter of cost as you seem to make it, SP wins in a freaking landslide. Canadians pay about 11.4% of national gross domestic product (GDP) to insure 100% of citizens in their single-payer system, compared with more than 17.4% of GDP to insure 85% of Americans. According to the latest available data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in 2009 healthcare expenditures per capita amounted to $7,960 in the United States compared with $4,363 in Canada. http://www.the-rheumatologist.org/details/article/1457997/A_Comparison_of_the_Canadian_and_U_S__Healthcare_Systems.html"
"You are not paying for me when I buy insurance. No other person pays for me when I buy insurance. A company does. The company decides which people to let into their pool, but my rates dont go up because you have cancer. Your rates dont go up because Im fat. The process is personal and individual. You can live or die or be injured or be healthy and it will have no effect on me whatsoever. With single government payer healthcare, my rate does go up if you smoke, or have diabetes. The government cant discriminate (as in, decide whether its worth it or not) services from one citizen to another like a company can. With private insurance I get the chose whether I want to mitigate my own risk. With government insurance, I have to pay whether I like it or not. Healthcare can be likened to building a house. When you buy insurance youre saying, Build me a house and tell me now what its going to cost. Single paying is like saying, Build me a house and tell me later what it happened to have cost. Nobody gives their contractor a blank check to build a house. Nobody should give their doctor a blank check to heal them."

So Obama wants to support legalization now that that the majority of the country does... what kind of asshole politician actually changes their view on a issue to match that of their constituency!

Push to get it removed from Schedule I then.
"Something tells me Obamas recent candor about legalized marijuana is directly related to an upcoming regulatory announcement. They will announce that its acceptable for banks to do business with marijuana dispensaries. This is the groundwork. Which is huge, really. If the banks can do it, that means were just steps away from marijuana being rescheduled. "
"Whether its a distraction from the NSA spying or not, its still a good thing to publicly state. Perhaps he can talk at about multiple issues at once? "
"Ill put this in same the bin as: Closing Guantanamo, ending wars, less drone strikes, curtailing domestic spying, enabling whistle blowers, and of course he pledged to make progress on the drug war when he was running. "
How important? Use that pen then...
"Its just a ruse, even if it does go through, there is something they are distracting us from. Look elsewhere...Syria, drone strikes, the debt, healthcare..."
**Because they need to distract People from the Appeals Court Judgement on Net Neutrality!**
"I feel like many of his liberal supporters are losing faith in him, and this is his attempt to regain that confidence."
"this guy is ridiculous. do any of you remember he laughed at the internet (real people) for making pot prohibition the number one question? remember how he wouldnt even take it seriously and mocked the topic? oh, now hes a great guy. fuck obamas opinion. he is no different than any other professional politician. he will say anything you want him to say. his opinion and promises are worthless to me."
"This is a brave stance for him to take. If only he were the head of several law enforcement agencies, he might be able to back his words up with action. Oh wait..."

A...a reliable source in r/politics????? The end is nigh. 
"Americans, I...uhh....I think its time that we...uh...as a nation.....umm....stopped thinking about the federal government monitoring all of your electronic activities....and uhh......started thinking about legalizing marijuana. If theres one thing our elected officials is good at, its diverting attention away from a serious issue. Im not saying legalizing marijuana isnt something we should do, but its not nearly as important as stopping the government spying. "
"What happens if weed gets legalized in my lifetime: Ill smoke some weed. What happens if weed doesnt get legalized in my lifetime: Ill smoke some weed. Carry on, America."
"But only he and the Governors have the power to pardon people. He can pass this off to blaming Congress like usual but this ball has been in his court for a long time and he, like everything, is pretending that there isnt some major corruption in the medical industry that is lobbying to keep things exactly as they are."
"The operative portion FTA: &gt;Were unlikely to see a 2014 National Drug Control Strategy that says, Its important for legalization experiments in Colorado and Washington to go forward. At least we now know **thats due to the inertia of a federal bureaucracy filled with drug warriors**, not the actual position of an elected official accountable to voters (a majority of whom actually now favor marijuana legalization)."
"Weed, like alcohol, affects everyone differently. But it seems that no one can see outside their own bubble. When I smoke pot, I become useless. Driving a car is literally harder for me stoned than drunk. My friends can get stoned and write an essay or go to work. No doubt that there are different chemical reactions for each person but Ive never seen it mentioned in public discourse. Politicians and media cannot lay off the absolutism."
Its another smoke screen (no pun intended) like gay marriage was last year.
Politicians attitudes (re legalisation) are following that of the people? thats odd

"Baby steps, but still promising. "
I feel like its important to point out that Obama doesnt have the authority to keep something illegal purely because he wants to minimize exposure when all polls point to the public wanting the opposite of what his administration does.
Obama is a big phony
Which is why he initiated more DEA raids on marijuana dispensaries than his predecessors
"Our think tank has concluded that it might be more useful to keep people docile while we screw them over, than keeping the prison industry fed with new meat."

its important all of a sudden because decaying capitalism needs new revenue streams and we sure as heck cant tax the 1 percent who OWN this plantation disguised as a nation. i aint paying taxes for something i can grow myself.
I think change is finally going to happen. I cant believe it.
I think this whole pot thingy is just a diversion for whats happening in the Middle East
"Obama is trying to create a new source of tax revenue while cutting DEA spending and prison spending. This is all about money, not about how harmless it is as a drug. Then once it is legal on a federal level, Monsanto will genetically modify the stuff to make a seedless strain and Obamas mission will be complete- to make sure only the right people get rich off sales of mj. And , of course, people will try to save their seeds and grow their own, but Monsanto bribed legislators will make sure that homegrowers go to jail for longer than moonshiners currently do. "
"What.... Obama... after arresting more people on marijuana charges... Well, Im not going not whine about it. Hope he actually does something about it."
Trade legal weed for domestic spying programs? OK!
I knew he was a fucking idiot all along.
"This Obama pro-pot stuff gives me the same feeling as the new Pope. I feel like its just a bunch of stuff being taken out of context, theres no way these people are being rational. With the new Pope I feel it may actually be real but with Obama I feel like hes going to back track or just do nothing to follow through on these words."
"Seriously: Thanks, Obama!"
"well he fucked us on healthcare, might as well get us high. As a matter of fact, I wonder why republicans dont just give in and legalize pot. SOOO many people would simply stop paying attention to politics at that point lol"
"Ill believe it when I see it, he did put someone very anti-weed as a drug czar "
"Last time Obama said this, the feds ended up raiding almost all the San Diego dispensaries a few years back. What a piece..."
[deleted]
"&gt;Finally, and most notably, Obama said of the two states experimenting with legalized marijuana, Colorado and Washington, that it?s important for it to go forward because it?s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished.? And yet the DEA is still raiding medical marijuana dispensaries and small growers in every state. Am I the only one who finds this to be incredibly hypocritical? Isnt this a bit like Hitler getting up there and proclaiming that racial tolerance is a good thing?"
So... why the sudden change in stance?
Sure is a lot of talk but not a lot of action Mr. President. 
i think i care for obama less than i cared for bush. i didnt think that was possible.
hahaha! Government cant control everything!

"If Obamas for it, theres got to be a hitch. Maybe because all this marijuana drug brouhaha is just a diversion from the real issue of when hemp will be permitted to be cultivated on a large enough scale to replace big oil."
"I am not much of a conspiracy theorist. Bring up the illuminati or something of the like and youll be quick to lose my interest. I used to smoke copious amounts of sinsemilla back in my first year of college and just want to point out what my relationship with marijuana did for me and for many people I know. Take a shitty situation, like being incredibly bored, or having family/friends do something to really upset you? You smoke a joint and feel better about it. If you are okay with this then by all means, toke on. The reality is that the issue is likely to still be there when you come down. Now comes the point. While I am 100% for the nationwide legality of Marijuana (hell, throw psychedelics in there too) I feel like something is quite amiss with Obamas half-assed endorsement. I feel like he is testing the waters to see how the nation will react to these statements. If he were to go all out pro-marijuana, that could severely damage his reputation. I understand this is his last term, but I guarantee he still cares about what the history books will say about him so he will still tread lightly when it comes to subjects like this. My biggest concern is that he is using the legalization of pot in one of the most concerning times in the history of this country. The surveillance state is seemingly unchecked (even with the Snowden leaks,) there were a minimum of 7,000 drones in 2012 (which has surely escalated,) and the polarization of our primary political parties is infinitely more so than what would be considered a healthy relationship. This is a time to be livid. This is a time to really stand up and say that we are on the wrong path. This is also a time in which we should be conversing with people with opposing view points. What does our Commander in Chief say to this? *Lets give them pot!* **TLDR; There is something strange about the president endorsing the legalization of marijuana in an age of surveillance and polarization, potentially making a distraction and causing complacency.** Edit: Syntax. "
"Realistically speaking, you simply cannot fight the future. The demographics of the legalization question make it clear that at best, this is an argument over when. The opposition to it comes overwhelmingly from people who will not be on this planet in twenty years."
"Then legalize it at the federal level, or at least let dispensaries in states where it is legal access to basic banking services. "
"1. Rescheduling it is within his authority as president. If he believes that its so important for it to go forward, he could at the *very* least do this. 2. I really dont want to hear anything about him endorsing it. A lot of conservatives are coming around to a more libertarian mindset, and if he endorses it then there would probably be a turnaround on this area due to people not wanting to be on the same side of an issue as him. Kind of like Democrats were when Bush was pushing for more oversight of Fannie-Mae. "

"Obama is a masterful politician. In reality he is a center right corporatist but the media, and many within this subreddit, hold him up to be some type of liberal demigod. Obama little by little changes the rhetoric about fringe social issues that cloud the debate while behind the doors employs many prior Bush appointees, codifies the former Bush tax cuts (which even bush could not do), still has Guantanamo open, kills countless people with drones, employs a huge and secretive intelligence apparatus that violates the constitution left and right, constantly agrees to cuts in SS and medicare masked as negotiations, the list goes on and on. The insinuation by Fox news and hardcore conservatives about how Obama is super uber liberal is outright laughable. "
All talk.
"Legalization is on his to-do list, right after closing down Guantanamo Bay, enabling government transparency, bringing spying on innocent US civilians to a halt, allowing people to buy imported medicine, and protecting whistleblowers. Hes getting right on it. Yup."
Obama has said a lot of shit that sounds appealing but he never acts on it. I have lost any remaining faith I ever had in the guy about a year ago.

"As a conservative who doesnt even smoke, this is one of the very very rare times that I agree with liberals. Legalize it now."
Then fucking do it Barry!
Is it possible that he is saying this so we get off his back about NSA? 
The man just wants his herb. 
"This is a classic case of Distraction , and give them a little so they shut up !"
"Not even the best lobbyists can prevent pot legalization, because the people want it and the government stands to profit in so many ways. If timber and pharmaceutical companies cannot prevent things like this, then expect legalization in the somewhat near future."
...because it?s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished. I wish theyd take this approach to speed limits.
Its weird that he is only coming out in favor of this issue after numerous polls show that the majority of Americans agree that pot should be legalized. 
"Seriously, anybody whos against legalization at this point either has no idea what theyre talking about or refuses to listen to the truth. The most important thing that I can even mention is that nobody should EVER dictate what YOU can and cant put into YOUR body. Its ridiculous! We are all sovereign human beings who want to be free. How can you call yourself truly free when big brother is telling you what you can and cant put into your own body? "
"You know he didnt want to be the first black president and the first dude to legalize pot. Its becoming such a hot topic with the states legalizing it, and he he is getting pulled into the debate."
"Be more clear with rhe headline. I was stoked because i thought he was in favor of legalizing, but hes still not."
"You know, it feels like this whole pot thing is a smoke screen for the NSA stuff that was making the news previously...."
"As much as I have supported legalization for the past 20 years, I do not trust these people. There has to be some ulterior motive - These are the same people who were busting down doors, killing people and pets and ruining lives with moral arguments and rationalizations not a year and a half ago. Whats the deal?"
Then why does DoJ keep busting legal dispensaries on his watch? 
"Another perfect Obama move. He has against marijuana legalization in the beginning. Once it started to move forward, he just kept his mouth shut to see how it would play out. Now that the public has shown support for it, he speaks out all for it. This man is spineless. He cant make a stand for anything. Whenever he has spoken in absolutes, they have been proven to be lies. "
Okay. So when can I smoke weed legally?
Of course it is important to end the war on drugs. We have real wars now so the fake one we made up in more peaceful times is redundant. All of those wasted resources can be used on the 100% real war on terror.
Why do they have to refer to it as pot? 
This is just to take the topic of his worthless NSA speech. Looks to have worked. 
"I know Im a little late to the game here, but this headline is a little misleading. Obama specifically said that its important that Colorado and Washingtons law go forward, not in general, meaning not busting down on them. Its a good experiment. "
"Too much money against legalizing it. Does anyone think Pfizer wants you to grow your own painkiller? Not good for profits. If anyone wonders why something does or doesnt happen, remember the root is almost always money."
It?**$** important for it to go forward.
Hes just doing this so people like him again.
Nobody cares what the Presidents *says*.
"I just hope when it is legalized, we see less of the kinds of people who revolve their lives around it. You know the kind. The ones who will paint a marijuana leaf in their wall, have weed bumper stickers, be called something stupid like w33dsm0cker420, and the ones who always talk about it. The ones who use it as a substitute for an actual personality."
"Obama felt a huge wave of sympathy towards the gays and therefore became pro gays. He now feels a huge movement for legalizing marijuana, and thus becomes the friend of the nationwide potheads. Judging the love American whites had for the blacks during his time, if Lincoln acted like Obama, the Thirteen Amendment would have never met the senate floor."
"While at the same time he is still ordering the DEA to raid legal dispensaries. Obama is blowing smoke. Just like he did when he promised to stop launching drone strikes against civilians, when he promised to stop DEA raids *5 years ago*, when he swore the government wasnt spying on US citizens, when he *promised* to close GitMo... and on, and on, and on. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-broken/"
But Im betting Obama will just sit on this comment long enough that he will leave it up to the next president to really make that decision. 
VERY good politics by the White House. Obama Administrations low-30s approval rating is due in part to young voters dismay with their surveillance policies. Not a coincidence that the Administrations position is being clarified now. Though remember the Justice Department said they would not challenge the Colorado and Washington state legalizations. 
Its not like he has another campaign he can lose. 
Translation for everything Obama has ever said about why legalizing weed should happen: $$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$$ :P $$$$$$$$$$ $$$
its important because we can tax it....i mean to go forward or something

"Sooo...if you say its important to go foward, then do something about it already!"
"I dont get why people think that Obama saying this has to do with the NSA thing or tax revenue. He said at the beginning of his first term that he wouldnt challenge a state decision to decriminalize marijuana. If you read his statements on weed I believe he obviously wants to support it but cautiously so he doesnt alienate people strictly against it, which is a big reason why marijuana legalization is coming so slow. Politicians are hesitant to support it. But now that the attitude of the people is largely shifting in support of marijuana legalization politicians like Obama are sloooooowly changing their public position. But I wouldnt be in the least bit surprised if he were all for it privately. He just doesnt have the backbone to come out and say it outright."
Theres this little thing called an executive order...
Oh really?
"This is all political postering. Obama isnt gonna change shit. Theres too much money, (jobs) tied up in illegal drug enforcement, he doesnt want to be the first president to give that green light. Obama is a master at saying all the right things at the right times and not doing shit about it."
Obama is a douche 
"He was talking about the Experiments that are Washington and Colorado, not legalization itself."
Talk is cheap.
Whens the last time Obama claimed a stance on an issue *before* the public already clearly spoke their opinion?
"I cant help but notice that the government is taking over the shady businesses. I predict the legalization of prostitution next, with the proceeds going to the IRS. Who controls the spending of all that collected cash? That would be bad guys of just a different type."
"I was listening to Fox News on XM and they were talking about this. One woman commentator said something like, woah, this is some dangerous talk from the President. He had better check his facts about the green stuff before making statements like that. Its anecdotal at this point! And if we really want more facts, lets allow for more studies!!! Gah. "
Obama has done nothing to legalize it. Hes full of shit. Hes just talking. 
"So no one gave a shit about Obamas executive orders on gun control, or the NSA spying on US citizens, but everyone cares about Obama talking about legalizing marijuana? "
Obama says a lot of things and does absolutely nothing. hes a great politician.
President Obama on pot legalization- Gettin me summa dat GOOD Denver kush!
"Now we need to retroactively correct the sentences of those wrongly convicted and sitting in jail or marked with an unjust felony. I know this is politically complicated, but this is vital to begin talking about. The Drug War has been Jim Crow 2.0 as far as Im concerned."
Yeah lets forget about all that NSA. WHO WANTS TO TALK ABOUT LEGALIZING WEED? ^^^easily ^^^distracted ^^^muricans
Stop your DOJ from going after dispensaries in CA then maybe??
There go my people. I must find out where they are going so I can lead them.
Looks like theyre going to do this. 
Please. This is just a ploy to get the current Gen of 18-35 year old voters to stay with the dems because of the NSA and big brother fiasco. 
Its all bullshit until I can smoke weed without the possibility of doing jail time because of it. And stop bombing kids ffs.
Come on Obama?now youve done nothing I agree with. Oh well. You were better then Romney. 
My SOPA sense is tingling....
"Some leader he is, jumping on the bandwagon after it has already begun to roll."

"This is proof reddit is used as a propaganda machine.... I mean who in their right minds still even cares about what obama says.... this is like knowingly listening to a child who has a fixation with lying.... What the fuck is this reddit? Hes lied about every other thing hes said, Why wouldnt he be lying about this? Posting his name does nothing but give him publicity....."
"Every time this is posted, his quote is shorter and shorter. Less context shows more overt support. "
"Im so fucking sick of hearing this. Its nothing more than an empty gesture. If he really wanted to change it he *would*. The fact that he has had one of the more strict policies on marijuana, and has passed on several pardons that would have backed this kind of talk, lets you know its all Bullshit. Just like everything else he says. "
Too little too late. He lied during his 2012 campaign and became even more tough on MMJ than Bush43 once in office. Too little too late. What a hypocrite.
"Hello misdirection, it seems as if only yesterday you were telling me that obama was going to end the wars. remember wiretapping? lol that was so fun, thinking that it was this seldom thing that only happened to important people."
Maybe the government is using this to distract us from whats really going on...
US Government got all 1984 on our asses now they are giving us our Soma. Its like they use dystopian novels as a guidebook.
"Obama deciding to legalize pot now is like your father saying you know I love you, after he beat the piss out of you."
"This is what I elected you for, with my own vote!"
"I dont often agree with Mr. Obama, but I do on this particular issue. I just cant help but feel like he is more motivated by the politics of it than by it just being the right thing to do, which sucks."
... for us to invade syria
"What the hell does he mean Middle class kids (ok im 24 and white not a kid...)dont get locked up? I was in jail for almost 30 days. I had no way to pay bail and my family in NY or NJ all acted like i was fucking criminal and wouldnt help me out. In an overcrowded cell using some plastic boat thing to sleep, with a dude who got arrested with meth and some 19 year old who robbed houses for money to buy dope.PEOPLE GO TO JAIL FOR POT . "
Pretty big about face from the asshole who raided more medical marijuana dispensaries than GW Bush. 
typical political hypocrisy http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/other/223693-obama-defends-action-on-medical-marijuana-dispensaries
"Oh no, now what is Gary Johnson going to be smug and sanctimonious about in his AMAs now? Without that tiny moral high ground, he has literally nothing but Steve Forbes flat tax. "
"Ive always respected the president, hes made a lot of mistakes and backed some questionable legislation. But this is a step in the right direction, a small step towards the end of controlling peoples private lives and I fully agree with it. "
This is the same guy who spying on all of us...
"Less talk, more action."
Im excited to see who gets elected next presidential election.
"Hes all talk. Always has been.... I voted for the guy because Romney would have been a disaster, but hes just another empty suit like the rest of them. "
"Its simple. Obama is waiting until there is a huge military operation overseas that he doesnt want people reading about in the news, and BAM!!! Legalize Marijuana... the entire country will be so distracted about a plant that can grow anywhere, that they will not see or hear about the thousands Obama slaughters somewhere in the middle east."
Thanks Obama
"You know whats really important for Obama? For people to focus on things that doesnt really matter. He is trying to avoid focusing on the major issues that he is partially responsible for. Like the massive debt, deficit, wars, future energy issues, global warming, QE, poverty, fascism, his numerous lies, NSA... the list goes on and on. But as long as the people have something else to focus on everything is fine, pot, homosexuality, democrats vs republicans (they are both the same), religion, terrorism... basically any topic that can be debated FOREVER."
But its important to the slave industry that it goes backwards.
I honestly do not understand why people like president Obama. He is a media whore with absolutely no conviction wholl change on a dime if it benefits himself. 
Never more relevant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlxkcewBEe0
This is big stuff coming from the President ... yes hes cautious in his words but he has to be. Can you imagine a President Romney saying the same thing? Romney would have the feds cracking down on Colorado right now. It annoys me when complainers never acknowledge good things.
Can we create a potpolitics subreddit and move all these stories to that so I dont have to hear about everything anyone has ever said about pot ever?
&gt; ?We should not be locking up kids or individual users for long stretches of jail time when some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done the same thing.? 
"He allows the NSA to spy on my, but fuck it, have an upvote. Also my phone kept trying to correct NSA to NBA. Is that racist?"
Translation: the Narcotrafficers are becoming so rich and powerful that we would like to weaken them and usurp one of their profit sources.
"I feel like Obama has a minimum popularity threshold to support any topic. Not that I disagree with legalization, its just why havent we heard about this until now? "
Were going to keep spying on you even if youre two steps removed from a suspected terrorist. Local law enforcement might even be able to get this data and the circumstances to accessing metadata is dangerously vague... *Buy hey you might be able to get high legally maybe soon.* 
"Gotta love the people shifting the goal posts. Obama doesnt support legalization? Hes not leading, transforming the way we want. so many young men have their lives ruined by simple pot possession. Obama supports legalization? Ah, erm, hes probably just doing it to take attention away from the NSA spying. I dont get how people dont understand that, if you dont support people even when they change to believe in your position, dont be surprised when fewer people change to support your position. "
Seems like pushing for decriminalization wouldbe a more logical and achievable step in most states
"&gt; Those who argue that legalizing marijuana is a panacea and it solves all these social problems I think are probably overstating the case. Youre wrong, President Fucktard. It is a perfect solution. The only flaws that exist are those where someone *partially* legalizes it. Where they legalize use, but not sales. Where they legalize sales, but fail to regulate it sanely. And this is true of all drugs, not just marijuana. We could bankrupt the cartels in a days time, if only we legalized, coke, heroin, and meth. Put them out of business already."
"Im against pot legalization personally, but Id rather the country move on and focus on real issues even if it means legalizing pot."
"A politician going with popular opinion?? Wow, so brave. "
"My goodness, if only there were a high ranking elected official who could push this forward. If only."
"He has the power to do it right now but will he? Talk is cheap. We need action, not words."
How about on of those executive orders he loves so much 
Shhhhh. Your going to confuse the republicans. They wont support legalization if you do too.
How weird is it to actually agree with something Obama has said lately? Now Im all suspicious and wondering what his angle is.
But he wont do anything. 
"Listen. Im a man who can compromise. Look, were in this together. OK? Sure, I said I would decriminalize Marijuana and stop wasting DEA resources on prosecuting state offenders. Then, I reneged. But look, - listen - this is about the right decision for millions of hard-working Americans. Thank you, God bless."
How I see this: Obamas supposed reforms of the NSA didnt have the effect they desired so theyre throwing us a bone to make us think if they can reform their ways on pot then theyll be able to reform the NSA. 
"Would it be too much to ask to have cheap, select-fire weapons in one hand and some dank, legal bud in the other?!?! Figuratively, of course."
This is one of the most sensible and logical government related headline in a long time!
"Hes doing all this pot-talk to distract us from the NSA issue. Seriously, how many headlines have you seen on Reddit the past few days involving Obama swaying something pro-marijuana?"
"If his record of getting things done is any indication of the future, weed wont be legal for a very long time."
Didnt you guys fall for this already? 
"If hed politely get the fuck out of my way, Ill grow me an Eden."
How brave of him. He comes out for gay marriage and pot legalization right after polls were released showing more than 50% of Americans approve of those policies.
"He is going to close guantanamo bay too, amirite?"
So hes still not admitting that he currently smokes cigarettes. What a piece of shit. 
/u/wikibot what is whisky speak?
"Come on Americans, you can do it! If you prevail then Canada will follow in your foot steps!"
This is probably the first time where I voted for an incumbent politician about whom I had serious misgivings and ended up glad I did so instead of sorry I did so.
"Any politicians strategy, no matter who it is or what party he/she is from: Give a speech about how important it is to do something. Doesnt do it."
God forbid he actually show some leadership about anything 
"Thanks, Obama. "
"~~legalization~~ I wish more people would use the term decriminalize instead. Calling for legalization makes it seem like we should have to beg permission from our government to do anything, that we should only be allowed to do things after proper clearance and approval. *Decriminalizing* makes it more clear that the government was overextending itself in appropriately."
"Just so no one gets the wrong idea, he was talking specificially about the states that were legalizing it, and not about the status of the drug on a federal level. &gt; Finally, and most notably, Obama said **of the two states experimenting with legalized marijuana, Colorado and Washington**, that it?s important for it to go forward because it?s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished."
"stoned people are less likely to revolt, or care"
"&gt; Finally, and most notably, Obama said of the two states experimenting with legalized marijuana, Colorado and Washington, that it?s important for it to go forward because it?s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished."
"Start with pardoning all Canabis offenses, and releasing all prisoners in jail for cannabis possession."
"I think this may be a huge win for democrats (Im independent). It seems like a pretty large majority is in support of legalization. And if conservatives tried to dig in their heels on this topic during an election cycle, it could really sway some swing voters."
"So you found out we spy on you. No, we aint gonna stop, but here, try some pot. If youre high you wont care what we do."
"Obamas a pro at saying what people want to hear. But hes telling the truth this time, right?"
"Coming from the guy who promised less strict regulation only to increase the number of busts on dispensaries, sure."
Its easier to run a tyranny when the citizens are stoned stupid and lazy.
Dont let this distract you from the spying.
"Well Obama, since you yourself used marijuana and cocaine (by his own admission) and never got caught, and turned out ok enough to be the president, how bout this: As of RIGHT NOW: we cease ALL arrests for possession alone. We could be arresting the future President, after all! If you think it should remain illegal, I expect you to turn yourself in for felony cocaine possession charges. Maybe Obama wouldnt be so dismissive if he was one of the countless minorities labeled a criminal forever because of a joint in his youth? Oh, but then hed never have become President to begin with!"
GET THAT CAKE
"Im becoming a single-issue voter when it comes to marijuana policy. I literally dont care what else their platforms are, Ill vote for anyone who is pro-legalization at this point."
More like its important for it to **grow** forward.
"?Middle-class kids don?t get locked up for smoking pot. Very not true, especially if they get money from parents and do it again for a secondary offense."
"The man is a moron and a socialist and always will be, im surprised we havent had a public burning of the declaration of independence by now because its pretty much gone down the shitter so thanks all you old corrupt fucks running the world"
"If I was him, Id want to be the first black president and the first to legally smoke a J in the oval office. Although that probably wont happen while hes in office still. Youre already in the highest office, why not make it higher?"
"[If theres ever been an appropriate time to use this .gif, its now.](http://i.imgur.com/vwMin.gif)"
Its happening!
"Obama is a hypocrite. Just look back at his campaign clips from 2007 and 2008; he lies in the face of interested citizens. I wont believe this until I see it, but Obamas presidency has been one lie after another. All the other presidents lie too, so theres that."
Illegal is illegal pot heads. Its the law ACCEPT it. 
Fap fap Obama.. Just to check.. Got a job?
dont forget that that this is the same Obama who also said in the same speech: &gt;marijuana is a drug with high potential for abuse but no accepted medical use
You are insane if you believe that President Obama wants to legalize cannabis. Hes had the FBI raid more state-legal medical farms than any other president combined.
"ITT: Oh, hes for pot! Lets totally ignore all the stuff we were mad at him about yesterday."
"Luckily because of the internet restrictions being passed, they can afford to let pot and gay marriage go as distractions while they shit on the american people."
Re-Leagalize Cannabis. End the War on[some]Drugs with Harm Reduction the cure. Peace.
I hope one of the last things he does is push through legalization otherwise it might be years before it happens if a republican gets elected
The Feds are killing Net Neutrality and leaving the NSA alone. Now theyre pushing legal pot. Connection? Hm.
"Well, Ive been putting all that effort into upvoting every single pro-legalization post I came across for all those years, and finally it looks like it begins to pay off. Thanks Obama."
Thanks for taking 6 years to make only a statement about your election promise to liberalize pot regulation
"A stoned, gun free society is easier to control."
Itd be nice to not have to fear being arrested for possessing a plant
"I dont want to sound like one of those Legalize it activists, however i have absolutely no problem with the use of recreational marijuana. Ive never smoked it, nor do i intend too in the future, but legalizing it would boost our economy and keep a steady cash flow into programs other people could benefit from. For example, im a disabled vet.... If legalizing the stuff would help ensure that i keep receiving much needed treatment from the VA.... Then im all for it. "
Wag that dog Mr. President!
"Fix Net Neutrality, then worry about pot. "
WE DID IT REDDIT
Hes just saying that to increase his reputation.
Strange. During his campaign when the majority of Americans said marijuana should remain illegal he didnt support its legalization. Now when the majority of Americans DO say it should be legal he changes his stance... I cant remember if thats for certain but thats what I remember from his 2008 campaign. 
Why are the comment scores being manipulated?
You lucky Americans - meanwhile we cant even buy booze after 10pm here in NSW (Australia) anymore ... looks like ill be filing for a greencard!
Loot our country dry on wars you promised us would end if elected. They never did. But hey your going to let us little people smoke pot! So rad!!! 
"Forget about the surveillance into every facet of your lives. Forget about the ramping police state. Now let me be clear, marijuana is not as bad as beer. Forget about the DHS tanks and bullets. Forget about the conspiracies proven. Forget about the gun and drug connection to Mexico. Make no mistake, marijuana might have some medical benefit. Forget about the federal reserves policy that will inextricably lead to a giant bond and stock crash. Forget about the nationalization of health insurance. Forget about the manipulation of metals, manipulation of libor rates. Let me be clear, making marijuana accessible to adults is acceptable if they choose to consume it. Forget about the secret CIA prisons in Poland where people are being tortured. Forget about the largest transfer of wealth to the corrupt in our nations history. Forget about the constitution. Forget about freedom."
"Wow...lets see how long this lasts before he changes his tune. Maybe someone should educate him about why pot is banned? Asian countries seem to keep this shit out of their countries, and generally, it works for them. Look who has most of our jobs?"
"He may have not have done much for this cause, but him being tacitly for it is probably quite important. Im sure another administration could have made it much more difficult for this to happen."
"&gt;Finally, and most notably, Obama said of the two states experimenting with legalized marijuana, Colorado and Washington, that it?s important for it to go forward because it?s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished. Unless its banking related, because then they are financing your campaign."
"&gt; it?s important for it to go forward because it?s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished. Wow, its really great that obama finally supports the shutting down of the surveillance state!"
"If your justification for keeping marijuana illegal is its health effects, then you should also be pushing to make alcohol illegal. Theres absolutely no reason, and no justification, for why alcohol should be legal and marijuana illegal."
"Says the the most obvious, mundane things and people act like he just discovered the cure for cancer and then get even more surprised once they realize its all political positioning."
"Who in congress hasnt done it? How many of our presidents in the last 20 years hasnt done drugs? People shouldnt do jail time for victimless crimes, period. "
Its imperative.
That asshole was still raiding dispensaries just a few years ago. Now that he can overwhelmingly see that people are for it hes all about making it sound like he was against it the whole time. It must suck to not have any principles except what others tell you.
"Id still like to know why, if he felt that way, his flipped on his promises to tone down prosecution of pot and had the Justice Department ramp it up instead. "
"Let your pen do the talking, Mr. President, not your mouth."
obama has no credibility whatsoever ... just another sleazy political opportunist
I think ultimately any party taking a stance is just going to needlessly divide some voters on the matter. 
The sooner we end the war on drugs the better. I think this is a step in the right direction.
So decriminalize it
"We must move forward, not backward; upward, not forward; and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!"
I cant believe the US is gonna legalize pot before Canada. As a Canadian I am ashamed.
"Fact is the federal government has no power over Washington and Colorados decision. Whether or not someone agrees with the legalization of cannabis almost everybody agrees on states rights and as the slimy politician he is, is playing into that now so he looks less weak. Remember, this is the same man who defends the NSA spying, he obviously doesnt give a s*** about whats right or wrong."
"Pay attention to this hand over here, shitizens!"
"Hey America, lets not focus on our spying activities of you, lets talk about drugs because thats really important you know, for freedom and stuff."
"[ I say, we must move forward, not backward; upward, not forward; and always twirling, twirling, twirling!](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121218180322/simpsons/images/7/78/Kang.png) "
"Well, youll all be glad to know that the Washington Post has decided this means that Obama is a liar who is ignoring his advisors to destroy our country: http://p.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/21/obamas-white-house-drug-experts-contradict-his-mar/print/"
"Good, he has stopped being a hypocrite about marijuana. Now if hell just stand up for privacy."
"I dont understand drug users, and I predict this comment will be downvoted but it is my honest opinion. It doesnt make sense to want drugs this bad."
Wondering why gov is behind pot legalization? Wait - this makes sense if the gov would know about big cancer shit coming - people could at least get their meds to stay calm. This would fit in the shit all around atm.
it is 4:20 somewhere...
"Dopefiend here. I hope to see all drugs legalized in lifetime. I much rather get my dope from a pharmacy than a gang banger. Also, I dont want to go jail."
A
"As much as I would like pot, and all drugs, to be legal, I have to wonder about motive when I see something like this hit the news..."
ITT: what obama says and what obama does has never crossed over
"...and turns around to unleash the DoJ and USMS on innocents. Seriously, what Obama says is exactly opposite of what his administration does. Its better he does it first and then crow about it."
"Im pretty sure hes done fuck all to reign in the DEA though, which (unless I missed something) hasnt stopped fucking with Colorado/Washington yet, despite the state legal status. If you really want to move forward with legalization, put a fucking leash on those dogs, and make the push to reschedule cannabis."
"Boy, theyre really struggling to find stuff to distract us from the nsa information, huh?"
Im not sure that poster is really helping us get people who are against the legalization of pot on board.
"but why dont we slow it down, man."
So before hes elected hes for legalization and against the war on drugs. Once hes elected he changes his mind and does nothing about it. Then when the issue comes up again he brushes it off. Now when more than 50% support legalization he supports it again? Flip flop flip flop.... 
First decent idea he had
"What better way to deflect the publics criticism of the NSA issue than to take a position of someone who cares about the use of pot? The War on Drugs has probably destroyed as many lives as any war engaged in by his administration. Maybe more. Last time I heard, the average sentence given an American citizen for murder was around 6 1/2 yrs, while the average given someone who sold an ounce of pot was around 9 1/2 yrs. Nice try, B.O."
He thinks everyone is just gonna forget his bullying of states that were legalizing and all the bullshit in Cali? What a dumbass!
Wow. So if Obama literally said &gt; Those who argue that legalizing marijuana is a panacea and it solves all these social problems I think are probably overstating the case. Then that means he thinks marijuana might be a panacea the solves all these social problems. I mean he took the time to qualify his dismissal of such an idea by saying probably. So it stands to reason the he thinks it just might be so. 
Ooooobaaamaaaa.... -Randy Marsh 
"Just not important enough to rescind the federal laws against it and re-categorize it as a medicinal herb as opposed to a Class 1 Dangerous Drug as it is now. Oh yeah, and liberate the people who have been imprisoned for possessing it and distributing it."
Personally I think its a method to impose polictical imprisonment similar to china.
"Would national legalization mean mass release for non-violent offenders currently serving time? Because if not, national legilazation seems almost cruel "
"Maybe President Obama, should nudge its legalization forward, sort of in the way he did with gay marriage."
maybe he start by pardoning those poor growers and ask the DOJ to back the fuck off of these guys.

"Over my lifetime, I have come to flatly oppose the Electoral College and its outmoded hold on American democracy -- and for much the same reasons that I reject the notion of states rights. This is one nation, not fifty. And everyone in it should have one, single vote with a value exactly equal to every other citizens single vote. How difficult a concept is that?"
"Im a little surprised actually that a democratic governor and legislature would commit to this- because it means theres a possibility of NYs votes going to a republican, which would otherwise never happen. I do agree with them though- time to get rid of the electoral college. "
"the electoral college is so archaic that i have no clue why it persists. Its a dinosaur, and the sooner we get rid of it the better off well be."
The Electoral College system was designed to send delegates from each state to vote appropriately back in a time when nation-wide voting was unfeasible... Logistics now (and for the past century) make nationwide/popular voting possible. No need for the Electoral College anymore. This needs to be addressed!
"The problem is that pretty much every state thats signed off on this so far is solidly blue; given the math involved, it seems like this is only likely to get to 270 if a couple of bright-red states like Texas sign on too. Rationally, this benefits non-swing red states as much as blue ones - Texas and Georgia would get just as much extra attention as New York would if this became law - but the fact that this would make it harder to prevent D votes from counting (through voter ID etc) and that and that it still feels a little bit like a stab at Bush v. Gore means that were probably a ways away from a point where they might get interested. The best thing that could happen for NPVIC would be for Hillary to win the electoral vote but lose the popular vote in 2016 - if that happens then well get to 270 EVs within a matter of weeks."
As a european i just dont understand how you can support a system where the vote of someone in wyoming is worth 3.61 times the vote of a californian... 
Damn Ive been writing a thesis on this actually. I never expected New York to approve this. The two times it went to the floor before it was passed by the Senate but failed in the Assembly.
This means nothing until we get rid of the First-Past-The-Post system. Electoral colleges arent really the problem.
"Thats great, but the larger injustice we have in our democracy is the congressional districting system we use to select representatives. In theory, the reps are supposed to have a direct connection to their constituents. In practice, few people even know who their reps in congress are. We would be far better served by a more parliamentary system where representatives are chosen as a proportion of the popular vote, rather than a winner take all system. "
"This thread is showing a lot of talk about tyranny of the majority vs. tyranny of the minority, but if we abolish the EC wouldnt that potentially give rise to viable 3rd party candidates?"
"I cant wait until enough states sign on to this then it gets overturned by the supreme court because every vote should count! Redistricting ensures my vote is meaningless unless I am in the majority party in my district. The electoral system is broken, let it die already."
"I think were all making this too complicated. Ive always thought the easiest solution to too much money, corrupt intransigent representatives and limited presidential candidate choice is just to completely eliminate parties. This would be especially great on the local and regional level where people wouldnt be able to vote straight ticket. If you had to actually know about the candidate youre voting for or be confronted with the fact that youve just been blindly choosing whoever is in the party column I think itd lead to a more involved constituency. Also if interest groups couldnt just dump money into the red or blue piles then itd make it easier for more middle ground and nuanced candidates to stand out. "
This would be huge for voter turnout.
How is this going to be fair to smaller states? What is the point of voting in a state like North Dakota if your votes are dwarfed by a state like California? I thought that was the original point of the electoral college?
"Its a good step, but gerrymandering is a much bigger problem."
Its a good start. Next campaign contributions need to be limited to $200 per US citizen and corporate contributions from any other source need to be outlawed. Corporations are not people and should never be allowed to participate in the electoral process.
"As an Ohio resident, thats the only thing Ive got going for me. "
I really dont like how the electoral college works. Ever since I learned about it in school something seemed wrong
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-joins-campaign-electoral-college-role-presidential-elections-article-1.1757896 New York joins campaign to end Electoral College role in presidential elections 
"the real problem with the EC is that the number or House Representative have been frozen since 1913. the population has tripped but the number of our representatives have not increase to match the population. in 1913 each Congressman represented about 210,000 people now they represent over 650,000. This is the real reason why the EC does not work properly. Congress has consolidated power in the hands of the 435, we need more citizen representatives not politicians in Congress. http://www.thirty-thousand.org/"
A bunch of states have introduced legislation that tackles this problem in different ways. In addition to the 11 states (including NY) that have already joined the [National Popular Vote Compact](http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/) there are a handful with proposed legislation to join. New Jersey (a current member) has proposed legislation to quit the compact and Utah has a bill to allocate electors by congressional district (Maine and Nebraska currently do this). Heres a [quick summary of 2014 bills](http://billtrack50.com/PublicStakeholder/5tAPCtbFQ0yODtHVaJwlJg).
Finally my vote will matter now.
Can someone ELI5 why this would matter?
[CGPGrey will explain why this is important.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k)
Can we get rid of first past the post while we are at it?
"To anyone who thinks this is just large states trying to drown out small states, consider the following. In the 2012 election the candidates [spend 88% of their advertising budget](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/track-presidential-campaign-ads-2012/) in the 8 swing states. Those 8 states make up only [18% of the countrys population](http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/11/politics/btn-swing-states). For perspective, the [70 largest cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population) in the US combined have a similar population size. They come from over 30 different states. So if we had the national popular vote and a candidate campaigned hard in only the 70 largest cities in 30 different states and won every vote in them all, they would get to 18% of the 50% required. Yet with the electoral college a candidate that wins just 51% of enough of swing states wins. So, removing the electoral college would actually **increase** the number of cities and states where candidates have to campaign. Furthermore all voters in politically polarized states would then have a say in the election. This is a good reform for basically everyone not voting in Ohio or Florida."
Small baby steps into democracyland...
"My brother wrote a high school government essay that started off If pro is the opposite of con, whats the opposite of progress? Youd think Congress, but youd be wrong. Its the Electoral College. "
And the GOP goes into a panic...
People apparently dont understand anymore why the electoral college exists. It is the only remaining safeguard against a tyranny of the majority. This legislation is insanely dangerous.
"This is great an all, but what prevents a state from violating this compact? Suppose we had this in 2000. Al gore won the popular vote by about 500,000 votes. So, the interstate compact goes into affect and the states that signed on to this are supposed to vote for al gore. But, Florida decides they dont want al gore as president and instructs their electors to vote for bush and they violate the interstate compact and George bush wins the electoral college. What happens then? Also, what happens to unfaithful electors? Suppose the electors themselves want to vote for whoever they want? "
"Youre really gonna wish you had that buffer. Is Rhode Island the same as Virginia? This does not make it more fair, it falsely equalizes the interests of every state ignoring all pertinent facts or unintended consequences. Its populist and short-sighted. But cuomo is batty so no surprise there "
"So, basically you would be removing the power of states (EDIT: as comparable entities) from elections? If every vote is equal to one another, than its fairly obvious that larger states *will* have a greater say in elections. It literally defies the reason we have an electoral college. "
The United States is not a democracy and it was never designed to be one. We are a Constitutional Republic. Majority rule is two wolves and a sheep deciding whats for dinner. 
"To those arguing for this who say their vote doesnt matter, there are better things you can do than get rid of the electoral college. First, in just about every state there are a lot of ballot measures that make your vote actually count. Even in the most liberal or conservative states ballot measure have the chance to go against the grain. Governors and representatives are important too and generally have a bigger impact on your day to day life anyway. If your presidential vote doesnt count...VOTE THIRD PARTY!!! It wont change anything, but if we can get a candidate or two some major attention, you might actually change the course of the debate in the two parties. Love him or hate him, Ron Pauls run the last couple of years has done wonders for the conservative party. They are softening on many of the issues that made them repugnant in the first place and this wouldnt have happened without the influence of people like Ron Paul. Ralph Nader and Jill Stein on the left are helping progressives in the same manner. Give them your vote and let their voices be heard or felt at least marginally. "
Id rather have proportional electoral votes (as opposed to a winner-takes-all system that most states have). This keeps the electoral college in place as a buffer. I dont want to be ruled by a mob.
This doesnt make up for the SAFE act Cuomo you scumbag.

"This is incredibly important reform. While it wouldnt do away with our current 2-party domination, it would at least put a dent in it. Right now, your vote is worthless if you are not in a swing state, and this desperately needs to end."
"And Cuomos pledge will be 100% valid until a Republican wins the popular vote and a Democrat wins New York, at which point the non-binding pledge will go right out the window"
"Its necessary, time to make this happen."
"Well Como decided to do something worthwhile. This is a change long over due. It was necessary 200 years ago, but were not still moving around in horse and buggies any more. "
Honest question: what are the disadvantages for the average voter of abolishing the electoral college?
"I think this is a great idea. I dont bother to vote where I live. I typically vote more Democrat than Republican, so in the deep south my vote doesnt matter. I do not think my district has ever voted the other way. "
"Beginning of the end of corruption, though presidential elections elect one person. Now we address how 10,000,000 votes for candidate A 9,900,000 for candidate B And 3,000,000 vote for C Canidate A wins though This is 12,900,000 for B &amp; C Made up numbers but do you see??? More people opposed the victor!!! "
"Im fine with this, but it should be enacted at a Federal level. There is a reason that a state that leans Democrat is being targeted for this change. If youre getting New York votes, give us some from Texas."
I find the comments here funny. So many people that think this system is fixable!
"I think we should reform the Electoral College, not get rid of it. By that I mean delegates to the Electoral College should be required to vote for the states winner. Getting rid of the college is just another way to get rid of the continuously diminishing checks that the States have on the democratic majority and the federal government. It is a threat to liberty."
"At first I figured it wouldnt matter much until every state does it, but when you look at how it actually works, it turns out that it only takes a few states on either side of the red/blue divide to do this to completely eliminate the chances of the popular-vote winner from losing the electoral vote. This is because any realistic scenario in which a popular-vote-winner loses electorally generally has a close electoral loss."
"Add voter ID requirements then well talk about ending the Electoral College. Edit: Dont downvote me, debate with me."
Direct elections wont work. The population at large are misinformed dullards. Yes that includes you and me. We honestly have no clue who is fit to lead.
"While were at it, how about one election day once every 4 years for everything local, state, and federal that we might vote on? Since turnout for midterms is pretty weak usually, it might make for a better democracy."
Why would their electoral votes go to the winner of the national popular vote and not the winner of the state popular vote? Am I reading this wrong?
Id rather see them apportion the electoral votes based on the state breakdown than going by the entire nation. All politics is local.
"As someone who used to work in elections, can you imagine the shit storm if we needed a recount?? "
How do we get Cali to do this? 
"When a candidate can win the popular vote but lose the election, theres a problem with the voting system."
"never going to happen... theyd have to repeal the 12th amendment and it wouldnt change things much, I think Bush v Gore is the only election that differed from the electoral college."
"This compact is never going to survive long term. If it does go into effect, it iss inevitable that at some point, one or more states are going to have their electoral votes awarded to a candidate that did not win those states. Voter anger in those states will put sufficient pressure on those legislatures to back out of the compact, or on Congress to nullify the compact. Additionally it is hard to see how the Supreme Court could uphold this compact if have voters in state A directly electing their electors by state vote, but the electors in state B are awarded not based on voters in that state but because of popular vote totals in other states. While states have the discretion under the Constitution to determine how to award their electoral votes, it seems like this situation may present an equal protection issue between voters in state A vs. state B. Finally, in a situation with a close popular election, the incentives for voter fraud to amp up the vote totals in states in the compact goes through the roof."
"Id rather have a system, where each candidate gets an electoral vote, based on the voting preference (outcome) of the congressional district. The candidate with the most congressional districts of the state, thus gets the remaining electoral votes of the state (2)"
"Doesnt matter a hoot. By the time the EC is involved, two shills have already been chosen for your enjoyment."
We need to end the ability of politicians to choose their districts. The college works fine. 
WOOT!
"As a New Yorker who sees no point in voting, but does anyway, this would certainly make my vote mean a lot more to me. "
"As long as the small states who agreed to the electoral college system in the first place are permitted to secede if this goes through, go for it."
"I agree with ending the current electoral college model. I think the states should still allocate their points to the appropriate candidates but based on the votes not as a winner takes all model. I dont agree with a single popular vote because it would only take one corrupt or fanatical district to swing the results. Each state should represent a percent (relative to the population), but its BS that a single state, lets say California or Texas becomes one big single party vote. This would solve the swing state problem and the results should be nearly identical to the popular vote. I would support the popular vote over leaving things as they are though."
"I hope this fixes some shit. Oh, wait! Their supporters still have BILLIONS of dollars to donate."
God forbid politicians are elected by the unwashed masses!! 
As a non American can anyone ELI5 the electoral college? 
"The electoral college is still a better system in my opinion. Due to the fact that we have a single member district system, you have two parties that compete for the majority of votes (Duvergers law). This then allows us to run two major parties who have credible bases with established amounts of members in Congress. If you take away the electoral college, you can ensure that more parties will run. While this is good because more people will turn out to vote for a vast array of candidates, over time this will allow for situations in which we have a President who only received 30% of the national vote. The increased amount of publicity for the smaller parties then opens the door for more radical groups (yes even more radical then the tea party) to start to get there name and brand out there. After establishing credibility, these groups will then be elected to congressional seats. If you think two party gridlock is bad for congress, image a multiple party congress in which there is no real majority holder and no coalition in order to try to establish some order. Lets just say that our system could not handle such an option. "
"Id say the college does have a purpose in the event of major national confusion...just be sure to elect/appoint trustworthy colleagues. Id be more interested in ending Gerrymandering without sacrificing third party possibilities (California == fail, nice try but still fail)"
"This is why electoral college votes should be awarded by district. Not winner takes all. New York joins campaign to end Electoral College role in presidential elections except by being a winner take all State, you have every negative of the Electoral College, and none of the positives. Our Founding Fathers are smarter than you and smarter than me. The EC is integral to our government. "
"This is a start, but this isnt the biggest problem with our elections... We need to get rid of corporate donors and large pact groups and lobbying donations. Or at least increase the laws around it. Make the USA a democracy again. Without these changes the middle and lower classes are doomed. "
Get rid of electoral college and people may actually vote.
New York joins this campaign??? Lol! Not likely. Republicans in NY who want that states electoral college votes to be broken up into pieces might want to join such a campaign ...
Any non bias person who actually cares about this nation would have voted for Mitt Romney last election.
Can someone explain why the opinion of people residing in other states should influence how NY spends its electoral college votes? 
Im emailing this article to my history/government teacher that I argued with constantly about whether or not to get rid of the electoral college. Im from Nebraska so his argument was that we would get even less attention than we do now but we already get none. 
Increasing the campaign range is the last thing Id want. The drives and deals to increase their funding would be more insane than they already are.
"The Electoral College in its current form does create problems. A middle ground between popular vote and the current EC is to have every district have 1 delegate. Basically that instead of NY getting 29 (not sure if still is for next election), each NY district gets 1 equaling 27. "
"With the two party system, does it even matter?"
Damn it. I really dont want to vote for Cuomo in the next election but now hes done two things I like (this and standing up for charter schools). Personally I believe it should be a system where you have to a majority of every single electoral county in the country. Presidential elections shouldnt be decided by who can simply win the major cities in the big electoral states (mine included).
"I hope they campaign to end it as a whole country, and not as the state, it would be the stupidest thing to do if it is just ny, split vote counts as percentage will give more votes to republican since ny is mainly democratic vote. "

"I would rather they make the process of becoming an elector simpler. It is there for a reason, we arent supposed to be a democracy, but a democratic republic. The electoral college is meant to deter mob thought, and it would be more useful if the electoral college actually made its own decisions now and then rather than following the popular vote. Thats what the house of representatives is for, true representation."
Such a hip things to be against. the model works just fine
Interesting....not sure how I feel about it.

But these makes your elections so compelling to follow! Especially on election night.
Sooooo NY huh? how about some [NYS gerrymandering](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/inkblot-districts-visible-proof-albany-gerrymandering-article-1.1013204) NY really has to clean up its house first.
So if this became the law in New York then the state could go red the next time a Republican wins the popular vote. 
Any large non swing state not using all their electoral college votes is just giving big advantages to the party they dislike. It has to be dont at the national level.
didnt our founding fathers wnat it this way? To prevent a tryanny of the majority? Is that still relevant? 
Is this actually going to happen though? The electoral college being removed would require an amendment to the Constitution which means a 2/3 vote is necessary in House and Senate. Is there that much support that 2/3 will vote for this?
ITT: People who have no fucking clue how the electoral college works. 
We need to have a direct democracy.
You should be more concerned about rural interest out voting progressive city residents than the Electoral College. Getting rid of the EC will not fix that and the fact that places like Des Moines Iowa decide who our candidates are 
"Is it wrong to want to keep the Electoral College for the same reasons the Founding Fathers wanted it? As in acts as a buffer between the people and the President. Is Hamiltons fear that a tyrant could manipulate public opinion not a valid one anymore? &gt;It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations. It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief. With an Electoral College the danger of manipulation of citizenry is removed is it not? In other words it acts as a check on an electorate that might be somewhat guided or duped by the elite/rich/possible tyrants. Or what of Madisons take that the general public was too easily influenced by passions or even too stupid or uninformed and for that reason a buffer was necessary? "
"This is great, but they will never get to the number they need unless some of the swing states (FL, OH, PA, MI) sign on (which they have no incentive to do). Unfortunately, I see this going nowhere."
"To anyone who thinks this will have a meaningful effect on American democracy, undo reading, keep calm and carry on. "
"In my cynicism, this is probably just an opportunity for more gerrymandering. Sorry politicians--not taking nothin from your pitiful press releases. "
"I know that this is supposed to force candidates to travel to all states as opposed to swing states, thereby forcing them to adores the needs of of everyone, no matter how small the state, but I dont see how this does anything but make the problem worse. Sure, states like Florida and Ohio wont get half of the campaign effort, but cities like Manhattan or LA would certainly get a great deal more effort than my home city of less than 60,000. "

I thought the reason the founding fathers came up with the electoral college was to prevent the majority from making a bonehead mistake and electing a bad candidate. It was a compromise between those who wanted a pure democratic vote and those who wanted an appointee and did not trust the populous.
"One of the few maxims that has any validity is to be careful what you wish for. Im one of those who actually thinks the Electoral College is particularly important if you care about separation of powers, especially when youre a Union of States. Its not my own metaphor but I believe its dead-on balls accurate. There isnt a person in the world who doesnt understand the winner of the World Series is the one who won the most games and not the team that scored the most runs. This is a perfect analogy to the election of the President by an Electoral College. Simply put, it makes the contest a truer test. Its pretty much undeniable, but go nuts. "
the giant media companies in LA and NY would love for this to happen. they dont get enough campaign money since it is pointless to spend money in places that are entrenched. 
"This doesnt actually end the role of the Electoral College. Electors will still be chosen and the Electoral College will still decide the presidency. It just changes the way states decide their electors; they will be deciding their electors based mostly on votes that actually happen in other states. For states that do not want to participate, it changes nothing. They still may appoint the same number of electors as they had before by whatever method their legislature chooses. So states that do not sign on to this compact get just as much say in the election as they have always had. This is just a clever way of ensuring the Electoral vote goes the same way as the popular vote. If thats the way those states want to choose their electors, I dont see how any fan of the constitution or democracy could object."
I live in NY and this is the first I have heard of this. 
There is 0% chance the EC survives once Texas turns purple. 
"Yes, yes. Witht he stupid electoral college you can win presidency with just 25% of the population voting for you. 75% against will have lost and they are the majority. This should have been done a long time ago."
Republicans are already scrambling to narrow the vote as much as possible to fight off the inevitable tide of changing demographics and disdain for their platforms. They would fight this tooth and nail. 
"In high school we learned about the Electoral College and my first thought was thats the dumbest shit Ive ever heard. There are a few good things about it, but they are heavily outweighed by the bad."
"So, basically, if Im a candidate I can skip New York and campaign in all of the other states since the winner of the popular vote nationally gets Mew Yorks votes. If Im a voter in New York, my vote means even less than it did before"
"I agree with this and all, but man, direct democracy is kinda scary. ...thankfully we have safeguards in the constitution against the follies of direct democracy, so its not so scary in america"
The U.S. is not a democracy and it was never intended to be.
Forget just getting rid of the ECV system. Bring in proportional representation.
I dont know why anybody would fight this. One person one vote makes too much sense. They also should move election day to the weekend so people dont need to miss work. Just this shitcunts opinion. 
Heres a map of states that have enacted this and those which are pending: [MAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartogram_NPVIC_Current_Status.svg)
I have mixed feelings on this on one hand I dont want electors being the real deciders of the election. But at the same time I question the political savy and ignorance of the masses. Such a complicated issue. 
I would like to see something to help out third parties as well. (ranked voted or some proportional representation) Going to a straight popular vote might help them in current swing states but with a pure popular vote I dont think youd get situations like 10% for Nader in Alaska in 2000. 
"Presidents are selected, not elected. Money. Is. Power. Get that into your rigid minds."
"Eliminating the Electoral College would stop giving random states such as Ohio, Florida, and New Hampshire all the power in an election."
"As a New Yorker, Im not happy about this. Instead of trying to find a way to fix the electoral college, it looks like were just gonna pretend it doesnt exist when it still does. So now my vote counts for NYs electoral votes, but someone in a different state has their vote count for their states electoral votes AND for NYs? Doesnt seem too fair to me. "
Any big red states considering this? 
Id like to know if all the people that are opposed to the college also oppose the bi-cameral legislature we have.
"Although Im all for this, my concern is that the Republicans would just expand their vote suppression activities throughout the nation rather than focusing on specific regions. As weve seen in recent years, its much harder to prove someone isnt playing by the rules than it is to break the rules, so in essence the Republican strategy will scale much better than those trying to stop it, especially given the fund-raising boost they just received from SCOTUS. Given that, doing something about gerrymandering would, I think, have a much more positive effect than this on making sure the voter actually has a say. That would affect not just presidential elections but every election down to state ones by making districts much more representative of reality. A popularly elected president with gerrymandered Congress cant be very effective."
Can they also go back in time to when Bush boy was elected and give it to the popular vote winner instead?
"I propose a compromise: An amendment to the Constitution that would end the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote for President, and eliminating the direct election of senators."
A
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat. Now thats a shit idea.
Its probably already been brought up but I have yet to find a discussion on what this would do to third party candidates. Would it not make them much more viable?
"Anyone who is for this has lost my vote, HEH. "
"Question: Why is there really a major push? Only 4 times has the electoral college actually chosen the president who didnt win the popular vote. John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison and George W. Bush [Source](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/)"
"I think the system is a good balance as it is The house scales with population, the senate has equal representation regardless of population, the electoral college is weighted based on the # or house/senate representatives it would shift too much power away from the states the federalist structure would be unbalanced"
"Yes, cuz i totally want California determining who should be president "
Its about damn time
"I mean if you guys really want idiots deciding elections based on who looks better on tv, or because my friends are voting for him so sure why not, then yeah go ahead and get rid of it....Im not saying the system is perfect but it prevents idiots from electing idiots..Im sorry but there arent enough people out there well informed enough to be able to correctly vote towards actual issues and this is essentially a safeguard against it."
This is the best way to ensure most states have no voice in presidential elections.
Fuck Cuomo
Im so excited about this! Is there a place where I can sign a petition to get my state in on this action?
"My state senator wrote a thoughtful article explaining his vote against NPV: http://willbrownsberger.com/an-unpopular-vote/ . I still dont agree with his position. But after reading this, I do respect it. "
"While a national popular vote is certainly a legitimate method of electing officials it manages to award much greater weight to areas of high population density. In short many of the candidates would focus heavily on the northeast and west coast since most of the votes are concentrated in those areas. Smaller, less densely populated states would be ignored to an even greater extent to the point where rural interests are no longer represented. Presidential platforms would more heavily benefit urban projects and infrastructure to the point that the rural voice would be lost. "
"Im all for scrapping the electoral college and going to to direct elections. In recent elections, candidates ignore both small states and large states if theyre dominated by one party. This leaves our elections up to a handful of swing states. I want to chime in that the electoral college is better thought of as the mechanism for bringing the 3/5ths compromise to the presidential level. Without it the white male voters from the north would have dominated white male voters from the south. People underestimate how much of the souths population was enslaved Africans. South Carolina for example wasnt majority white until the 1920s. Without the electoral college, the white south would not have been able to vote for the black south."
"It makes me happy just to see the conversation happening. I dont think itll happen too soon, but the fact that were talking about it is a nice sign of progress."
"Yeah, its still gonna be a shit system until we get money out of politics. If the first requirement to be electable is to have a shit-ton of money for the campaign, then this isnt a democracy. We cant get to vote on the people we want. Instead, were forced to pick between the 2 richest guys. [These people](http://www.wolf-pac.com) are working to solve the problem. Join the movement if you wanna get your democracy back."
What will be the effects of this in a money dominated system like ours? Will more private interests try to get involved in the Ferguson-investor coalition model of electoral politics or will citizens have more say?
"While I dont support the electoral college as I dont believe my vote has realistically counted yet, there are some problems with getting rid of it as well. Lets talk voter education, specifically about the issues and the candidates themselves. In a perfect world everyone would have a vote and each would influence the election directly. Thats awesome until you remember how the majority of the voters would decide. Today the few who decide get bombarded with ads, visits and media coverage. Without the electorate college those visits and ads would be spread out across the nation (good thing) and more people would receive less direct contact with the candidates (good-ish). The rest of the campaign tactics lies directly in gaming the media to a significantly larger scale than today. A large portion of voters are really only accessible via the media. My only hope would be that candidates use the internet to voice issues instead of slinging mud at each other. I still support getting rid of the electoral college but I dont know really how an election would play out. We only know what the results would have done and even then the rules were different so that doesnt really work as a model."

"The President (with their VP) is the one nationally elected politician in this country - its obvious that it should be by a popular vote for a number of reasons. Approval_Voting laid out some great ones but here are some extras I didnt see in his comment: (1) people who are in very red or very blue states essentially feel like their vote is worthless because their states electoral college votes are a done deal before the voting even starts. (2) I do think its a problem that small population states get more electoral votes per voter, its simply unfair. why should someones vote in Montana count more than someones vote in California? small states already have over-representation in the Senate, they shouldnt get extra weight for their presidential votes as well. "
Talk about slamming the barn door after the Bushes are out. 
Yes. Because this is why everything is fucked up... :/
"Since no one is commenting on the benefits the EC has I will list some. The big one is that it insulates voter fraud from the rest of the election. Imagine you are a republican governor in north dakota, you know your state is going to vote overwhelmingly in favor of republican president with EC there is nothing you can do to influence this election. In national popular vote you can suppress the democratic vote in your state, you can destroy democrats ballots, you have more incentive to disenfranchise them etc. In the current system you dont give a shit because their vote does not matter for the big elections but for those people their vote still matters for local politics so the EC system is better for them. The EC system means that every state has some individual relevance to the presidential election without it the candidates are just campaigning on national issues and not caring about local issues effecting each state. They wont care that southern gulf states need hurricane relief, northern states need factory jobs, etc. They will campaign purely on national issues, though their campaign will spread to all states it will be less focused. At least now they help out in the swing states in the national popular vote they not bring any attention or relief to local issues. Presidential campaigns are mostly pointless you know how the candidates stands either you want vote for him or not, at least when they visit the small communities in swing states they help out with their campaign efforts, if they only visit major city centers they wont help out anything. The small town farmer will have much less influence and never see the candidate because it is better for them to visit only city centers where they can talk to the most people. In the EC system every last vote counts in the swing states which means they must talk to local farmers and rural residents which is representative of farmers across the country not just the swing states. In national popular vote they will never bother to visit farmers or address their issues because there is no need to get their vote"
The electoral college needs a lot of reform but this will just lead to nominees campaigning/focusing in large population centers. The original idea of the electoral votes was to prevent this tyranny of the majority and spread the focus of the nations politicians. Its failing in that regard but there are likely ways of remedying it instead of getting rid of the entire concept. 
I didnt even know this was a thing. Which other states are in this? Whats the likelihood of the Electoral college really going away?
i remember patrice saying something about that...
***ONE MAN ONE VOTE***
"Its a damn shame that we cant simply do away with all this proxy shit in the first place and just create some kind of app that would let people vote directly on everything. I mean, its definitely possible in a technological sense, but this is America - home of the electronic voting machines that mysteriously seem to always screw up in a way that changes every vote to a Republican candidate."
"But for the electoral college wed have had President Gore instead of Cowboy W. The world would be healthier, safer and happier today if that had happened. That said, the top comment as of this moment states, accurately I think: removing the electoral college would actually increase the number of cities and states where candidates have to campaign. This worries me some, because that broad a campaign requires a boatload of money and I therefore think it tilts toward the candidate better able to land big donors. That tends to be Rs. "
" My Poli Sci class said the electoral college was established because there was no national system to tabulate votes. The votes were counted locally and a representative was sent to Washington to tell them what the vote was. It makes sense, since it was a 2 week ride to Washington for some states representatives."
"Some states are strongly red and some states are strongly blue, because they are seeing different campaign ads. Without the electoral college, we would all get to see the same ads. Maybe wed understand each other better."
"For now we need to do the following: * Get rid of the Electoral College * Move to a better voting system, like the Alternative Vote (its not perfect, but its the best suggestion Ive seen so far) * Work with gerrymandering to make it more fair or make gerrymandering impossible some how."
"Yes to this! Most votes in the US dont even count unless youre in a major city. This is why I done even bother to vote anymore. For example, to win Minnesotas 10 electoral votes, all a candidate has to pretty much do is win Hennepin County. The folks in the outlying areas are pretty much ignored. "
"The first question I ask whenever something is being changed is this: what is the worst way this could be exploited by someone trying to game the system? Ask that, because sooner or later it will happen. Is there a way for more conservative states to manipulate this since it seems to be more Democratic/battleground states signing up for this and not Republican ones? One thing I do foresee: instead of shenanigans in mostly just swing states like Florida and Ohio, youll see election shenanigans across the country in hundreds of different districts as corrupt local officials try to give their side an edge in the overall vote. Voter suppression efforts are going to go through the roof."
"Non-american here, can someone give me a dumbed down explanation of what the electoral college is?"
"Whats interesting is that depending on how minority turnout is post-Obama this could actually help Republicans at the expense of Democrats. The entire Republican plan right now is to motivate white voters who already trending towards the GOP anyway. However, its looking like they are really only succeeding in states that already vote Republican anyway in the South and rural West. Again this depends on future minority turnout, but it is at least *plausible* that they could win the popular vote but lose the electoral college because Democrats are making gains in every swing state."
"ITT people saying electoral college isnt fair. Reality - only once in its history has the popular vote differed from the electoral college vote. Its one thing to want to get rid of an institution for waste or obsolescence, its another to say its unfair when a hundred years of history says otherwise. "
"This is huge. As someone who considers myself more as a Democrat, but lives in Utah, my vote is basically meaningless."
"Isnt this, in theory, how it should be done?"
I dont think there were any a Obama or Romney TV ads in California during the last election cycle. Neither candidate would waste money here since Obama would win by a landslide no matters what. 
According to [Politfact](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/sep/13/eddie-bernice-johnson/voter-fraud-occurs-texas-though-convictions-and-gu/): 18 since 2002.
"There are millions of dead people still on the voter rolls. There are also millions registered in more than one state. 46 states have convicted people for voter fraud. So how do we catch it if we dont require id? with the low voter turnout in this country, how would you know if someone voted in your name? Do you vote in every local and state election in your district? If not, how would anyone know that someone else was voting using your name? You want me to keep going? Do a little research before making blanket statements. And by all this, did you mean having to sign a piece of paper when you vote? I could just as easily say All this, so you dont have to sign a piece of paper stating you are who you say you are even though your id doesnt match who you say you are?"
All of this to prevent how many cases of voter fraud? Zero? One?

There doesnt seem to be financial backing from individuals or voter turnout to reflect anyone showing meaningful interest in the subject.

Fucking Blue dog democrats

"&gt; Someone at the heritage foundation suggested something similar 20 years ago, but it was not popular among Republicans. Apart from Mitt Romney, elected by Republicans as the latest presidential candidate who implemented it in Massachusetts and Newt Gingrich who praised it loudly. Nope, not popular among Republicans. No sir. "
Doesnt change the fact that the GOP doesnt have an alternative. 
"Lol, right wing spin right there. The right wing Supreme Court even supported it. Obama is to the right of Reagan."
"&gt; Someone at the heritage foundation suggested something similar 20 years ago, but it was not popular among republicans In 1993 Clinton pushed for Universal Health Care and was shot down.

"&gt; Obamacare didnt get a single republican vote Can we stop pretending that Republican votes have *anything* at all to do with the substance of what they are voting on, rather than who is proposing the policy?"

"&gt; The dems could have passed single payer if they had enough support in their own party, but they didnt. At no point in the past 6 years, have there been 60 *Democrats* in the Senate ... so no, given the current Filibuster rules - they couldnt have just passed anything they wanted."

They accepted *200* Republican amendments in order to get them, and thought they would get a bunch of their votes - until the Republicans pulled a stunt and refused in block. Getting bi-partisan support is critical for any major legislation, the republicans denied it, and the Democrats were barely able to scrape together enough votes to pass what the Republicans helped build. And yeah, there were a lot of conservative Democrats in the South. Those seats have mostly flipped Republican since. Part of the whole Southern Strategy thing, that Obamacare helped speed along.

"I think you undersell how popular the Heritage proposal was amongst conservatives during the Clinton era. But putting that aside I think theres a strong case to be made that Obamacare really is what a conservative health plan would look like. [Krugman made this point] (http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/obamacare-the-unknown-ideal/) pretty well. Of course, this assumes that conservatives/Republicans see a large portion of the populace not having health insurance as a real problem. If you assume that to be the case then the most conservative way to address the lack of health insurance is Obamacare. "
"Theres no fundamental requirement for a debt ceiling in the first place; most other countries dont have such a concept. It was created by legislation, and could be done away with by legislation. It serves no other purpose than as an artificial bargaining chip (or these days, a gun to the head)."

Raising the debt ceiling is a requirement. Dems have never threatened not to raise the debt ceiling.
"Obama had no power and was a state senator. This is the reason no one heard about this. The dems didnt threaten to the brink of default for political gain. &gt; I think that its important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president. When youre a senator, traditionally whats happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit &amp;mdash; for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we, we cant play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And Im the first one to acknowledge it. Is this all you got? Republicans used to have ammunition, firepower. This is like a pop gun with a flag that flies out when triggered saying bang. Sad really. Theres no fight anymore.

"25 that supported it? What about all the Republicans that have tried to repeal it what...40 times now? Even Mitt Romney himself has relentlessly been attacking it. All in all, its a great idea as it takes a lot of hand-holding out. Yes, people are pissed because they have to pay more (I cant tell you the number of people that Ive argued with that, quite literally, said that they would much rather spend the money on themselves than on healthcare, leaving everyone else to catch their bills), but responsibility is something that all of America has been particularly low on. Also, presuming the fuckhead doesnt pussyfoot around, this is a fantastic first step towards the system that every other developed country uses...you know, socialized healthcare. "
"Chuck Grassley also put it in the bill. The democratic house actually said they would vote against any bill with a mandate. Then the house was put on the spot, either pass the bill with the mandate which made it out of the senate or get nothing passed. But they did pass a reconciliation bill in tandem with the senate bill. The reconciliation bill removed all criminals and civil penalties from not paying the health care tax if you dont have insurance. So while the IRS will garnish any return you are getting to pay the tax, they cant take you to court, try to charge you with a crime, or force you to pay any other way. Just keep in mind, the IRS will track what is owed and any time you are supposed to get a return, they will take it. You can therefore avoid this tax if you adjust your paycheck withholdings so you either get no return back at the end of the year, or slightly owe money."
Is obamacare just forcing people to buy privatised healthcare? Or does the state cover the cost? Still baffling to us with state healthcare..
"Well yeah, but gee...a Republican cant back it if Obama thinks its a good idea...that would go against their people - the HMO lobbyists."
"The individual mandate is an obviously necessary part of any kind of universal health care plan using the insurance model. Otherwise youd have people who only bought insurance when they were sick, then dropped it when they were well - which makes the entire system fall apart immediately. Its not Republican or Democrat, its just the only sane way to put an insurance-based system together. What the Republicans have *not* done, nor will they, is propose an actual single-payer state-run healthcare system. Because that would drive insurance companies (who spend millions in elections and on lobbyists) out of business."
Which just goes to show how far tp the right everyone has moved in 24 years that the Democrats now support it and the Republicans think it is socialism.
"Its interesting to me how one party never gives the other part credit for an idea until the original party no longer endorses it. I would love to see either party pass a bill and, as they were trying to pass it, give credit to the other party."
"What blows me away is that everyone here is glad to shout about how the right tried to push for something over 20 years ago, and that some how invalidates libertarian concerns about it today. So fucking what? I also wasnt even a year old in 89, so does that mean I need to maintain whatever opinions I had then, now? If so...MORE BREAST MILK!"
Why Im not a big fan of Obamacare. It was really a gift for the insurance companies championed by Republicans. 
Overton window
"Billed over $5,500 for a few skin cancers to be removed from my face. The surgery didnt last more thn 25 minutes in the doctors office. Then fight with the insurance company, filing appeals, because they denied part of it as a cosmetic procedure. Meanwhile my insurance premium has increased double-digit each year to where we pay now $1,200 per month. This system is unsustainable. Having bake sales or setting up contributions for the few health care horror stories about individual cases that show up as some human interest story in the news is not a viable solution. SOMETHING needs to change. Obamacare is not perfect but it is a start. "
Free health care ! so that when you come in for an abortion we can deny it to you. PRAISE JEZUS!
"To the individuals in the US Congress and Senate, it matters not the quality of the proposed idea or its changes on society. It only matters who gets the credit or blame for the idea. Thus we have republicans adamantly opposed to their own idea simply because democrats will end up with the credit for it. "
"The individual mandate is an idea which republicans would want to support viewing it at face value. However, it is not the only characteristic of obamacare. The other aspects, such as requiring small businesses to pay for their employees healthcare are the ones which make republicans despise the idea of obamacare. FYI I didnt read the article;only the title"
"Not sure if this proves republications support Obamacare, or if Obamacare is a terrible plan."

It was first proposed by the Heritage Foundation in 1989. And scores of Republicans?not just Mitt Romney?have backed the idea in the past couple of decades "
I dont want to be responsible for your medical costs . That is the quintessential republican philosophy and is the essence of obamacare. The gop should be all for it. 
And Obama was against it.
I wonder if the democrats voted for or against it.
"Its funny how Obamacare is seen as a left-wing piece of policy, yet its a very conservative idea by the standards of the rest of the developed world. Theyre acting like this is the NHS or something."
"Actually, it was first introduced by Nixon..perhaps Heritage Foundation picked up on it, or instantiated their own version and really pushed for it"
"And its still a terrible fucking idea. Single payer is the only reasonable, sustainable, moral system. "
This argument has been made many times.... There is a different between federal requirements and state choice. 
"Ive told this to a lot of republicans, the only response I get is Nuh-uh!"
"I love how weve come to the point where all outrage at the individual mandate, [including Obamas](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/27/barack-obama/force-yes-but-she-wants-it-affordable/), has been shown to be phony populism. At heart, everyone understands that the mandate is necessary to have universal coverage in a non-single payer system. But its just so easy to rage against at anti-freedom in order to win an election. Obama [opposed it when running for president](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/opinion/30krugman.html), then quickly [adopted it once in office](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/03/the-mandate-memo-how-obama-changed-his-mind.html) because it was a necessary component of health care reform. Romney instituted the individual mandate when he was Governor of Massachusetts because all of his advisors told him he needed to to make health care reform work, but then Romney opposed the mandate when running for president. The end result is that good, sound policy is opposed by the majority of the public because politicians on both sides on the aisle have opportunistically attacked it to gain an electoral advantage. "
"In the end though who supports it doesnt make it a good or bad idea. Some Democrats and some Republicans might also change positions on mass wiretaps by the NSA based on who is in office, but that doesnt make the policies any better or worse. The problem with the individual mandate is that it becomes one more burden for the freelancers and self-employed, and thus it chains people to corporate jobs. This sort of program benefits the moneyed interests because it reduces competition, and turns owning a small business into the privilege of the independently wealthy. The individual mandate is thus a contributor (along with programs like Medicaid) to a sort of wage slavery that has taken over our country. The real problem in my view is that real health care reform is impossible unless we accept that Medicaid and Medicare cannot continue in their current form. If we spent as much on medical care per capita as Canada does, these two programs, with no further funding, would cover almost all Americans. But if one says that Medicare is a part of the problem, the political discussion gets shut down. In my mind there are only two acceptable solutions, from where I sit. The first would be a series of pro-market reforms aimed at better price transparency, quotes before non-emergency care, etc. Lets have medical guilds, and compulsatory licensing for patents in medicine. For all the talk of free market forces by Republicans none of these options are ever on the table. They push monopolistic reforms which will surely raise prices (as will the inability to say no to a bad insurance deal under the PPACA). But the second would be a distributed, localist single payer system along the Canadian model. In Canada, the provinces each have their own systems and the federal requirements are so lax that every province well exceeds them (this is important because it increases bargaining power by the provinces regarding costs). Keep the decision making local and the decisions about coverage local. But for all their talk about universal health care, there is no way that any Democratic lawmaker will be willing to endorse reforms that hand Medicare to the states. Our system is doomed because both parties want to use the health care crisis to ensure that the middle class is a working class, incapable of owning small businesses."
"All I see in this thread - shit on Obamacare, downvotes...shit on republicans, upvotes. Lol"
"**SO WHAT?** honestly, so what? It doesnt matter if it was a republican, libertarian, democratic, atheist, jewish, muslim, communist idea. If its a bad idea, its a bad idea. Do you honestly think the government forcing a private individual to purchase a private product or else face a penalty just for being alive is ok? Where does the power of government stop? We get so caught up in this Left vs right debate, we forget, it should be about the actual idea itself, not the person."
Isnt Obamacare not doing well?
Dont forget that Republicans wanted this kind of healthcare reform since Nixon. http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2009/september/03/nixon-proposal.aspx 
But . . . but . . . *SOCIALISM!!1!*
That doesnt make it right.
"Not any longer, not since Obama ran their own idea past them."
Republicanism isnt a thing anymore. The Republican Party has been cleaved in two - pro-business conservatives and ultra-right-Libertarians. There is no organized Republican ideology anymore...which makes this observation scores of Republicans nonsensical. 
"If it was called Romneycare, they would reject it, but if it was referred to as Bill Lee Care, or TedCruz care, these hypocritical, uber obstructionist ass bags would trip over themselves to vote it up. See, yeah, it is all about the relentless attacks on the O-man. Fuckin phonies, the bunch of em. AND..if you voted for them, you should truly be ashamed. "
And what the Dem staffers came up with in the backrooms is nothing like what they supported...
"Honestly.....Who gives a single, solitary shit??? The individual mandate is a horrific violation of personal liberty! What does it matter if 25 Republicans supported it in the past?! Democrats, Republicans, you both need to stop pointing fingers and get your shit sorted out. Dont you people have anything better to nag about than Republicans??"
"We know. The Republicans dont even care about their own ideology anymore. They right only cares about being against the left. This means eventually, there will no longer be any allowable rational ideas in Washington. Everything will be extreme fringe politics."
"Chafee turned Independent, and Lugar was deemed not Republican enough by dipshit Indiana Republican voters in 2012 ([their guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mourdock) went on to lose)."
Our family insurance just went from $92/week to $150/week and the owner of the company sited Obamacare. This is a company of more or less 100 people. I would consider our family to be lower middle class or upper lower class. We live paycheck to paycheck. This is a pretty substantial blow.
"ObamaCare was *the* republican position on healthcare reform, right up until the moment that Obama came out in support of it. Its a republican strategy with all of the traditional republican failures. Obama ran screaming from anything even remotely left-of-center on healthcare reform, because he believed (and apparently still believes) that if hes conservative enough the GOP wont be mean to him. What an idiot. The bizarre miscalculation on the GOPs part was to ramp the hatred of their mandated health insurance plan up to 11 and hang it around Obamas neck as socialism, and then run its chief architect as their 2012 candidate against Obama. I have no idea why they decided to do that."
"The US will never have genuine social services, not because of Republicans, but because Democrats agree with Republicans that everything should be a corporatist/government hybrid."
Almost all of those Republicans are out of power now. The party has been taken over by extremists. 
"**Originally a neo-conservative idea**, which it still is. "
"As a non-american, I am still not 100% sure what the whole Obamacare thing is. To my knowledge, it simply requires people to be insured right? wouldnt that therefore be of benefit to the rich, and of little real value to the poor? sounds like it is right up the conservatives alley. But I dont know that much about American political history. And I have heard that the republicans used to be fairly libertarian. Feel free to educate me on it if I am wrong anyway. "
It was put forth to counter Hillarys single payer plan in 1993. edit: Spell correct - After my phone auto corrected hillarys into hillbillies and my poor attempt to correct
"Of course they backed the plan, they just never wanted to see it ever enacted. Thats what horrifies them."
"Well, two things have changed since 1989, damnit: 1.) The Presidents middle name is Hussein, and 2.) the President is black. Duh."
"It was your bad idea before it was our bad idea, so that makes it just fine."
"To say that ANYONE supported Obamacare before it was Obamacare is about as asinine a position as Ive heard Obamacare is TEN THOUSAND PAGES OF REGULATIONS - to devolve this to one friggin point is ridiculous. Tired tired tired of both sides on this. Obamacare is a Train wreck - but we need health care for people who cant afford it! I coach Middle School Football - yesterday (extreme heat) we had two boys who we held out of practice because they werent feeling well. After 30 minutes of practice I went to check on them (they were sitting in the shade) and both boys were complaining of terrible stomach pain. We wanted to make sure they didnt have food poisoning so we called their parents. One of the mothers showed up (by this time her son was writhing in pain) and we asked her to please take him to be checked out -her reply how do I do that, I dont have insurance I teared up right there - here was a boy who needed to see a Dr and the mother felt trapped because she did not have the money for a hospital bill. "
Planning to do something doesnt make that thing happen...
"Note that the Heritage plan had a few key differences from Obamas plan, notably that employers should NOT have to cover employees. Edit: Oh, and if you want to actually *read* Heritages 1989 plan... http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1989/a-national-health-system-for-america"
"This could mean one of three things: 1. Republicans will fight against anything that Obama puts out, even it its their own ideas 2. Obama is not the president that the liberals thought they were voting for because he is more right leaning than any previous democrat in office 3. Both and we all lose"
"This isnt news. Everyone knows all republicans hate it because A) FOX news told them to, and B) Because the Democrat socialist Muslim (black guy) is making it real. "
"What idiot Republicans supported previously does not effect my view as a libertarian/conservative. Oh, you mean a moderate Massachusetts Republican like Mitt Romney thought that expanding the government with another massive social welfare program was a good idea? Well I dont care what he thinks, and its not. Bush instituted a federal takeover of the education system with NCLB, pushed for giant bank/corporate bailouts, and massively expanded the social welfare state with Medicare Part D. Obama is doing exactly the same thing - common core, his own bailouts, and Obamacare. I am and was against them in both cases because the last thing on Earth we need is a more massive federal government and more debt that will eventually collapse the entire country."
"So basically the GOP planned this slow motion humiliation for themselves, as more and more people like the law and more and more people realize the Republicans were for it until the Dems were, not to mention the Republicans promptly lying about the law for years. Not to mention, the more this gets discussed the more stories run on how Americas old system was the least efficient most profit taking price gouging system in the world. Basically the GOP gets to stand in the sidelines as craven lie after craven lie is exposed before the world and humiliation rains down. tldr; bad people and liars eventually get whats coming to them"
"It was championed by republicans to operate at the state level. Not to become the sprawling, federal shit show it is now. "
Single payer is the only sensible way to go. Its a lot cheaper and pretty simple. 
"Of course it was. The individual mandate is insurance juggernaut protectionism. The government guarantees that citizens will buy stuff from a particular industry, but does nothing to provide it. Blatant protectionism trussed up as a healthcare plan. Single payer, or bust."
The GOP crackers just dont want a brother to get the credit.
"no shit. only the fascists pretend to not know this, unlrearning being a consevative value"
"Why is this becoming the new democratic trope just now? I worry that certain people in power are spitting out this new talking point to hedge their bet. If Obamacare is loved, great. Otherwise, blame it on Republicans and say it was their idea to begin with. I really dont know how this is relevant currently otherwise."
"Republicans didnt support Obamacare, it didnt exist. They did support universal healthcare, but not in the form that obamacare has taken, they envisioned a much more simple law that didnt base its entire funding on the individual state. "
People are still trying to champion and spin this godawful healthcare law?
[deleted]
"A lot of those Republicans are no longer Republicans. Arlen Specter switched to the Democrats in 2009, partially because he knew his support of Obamacare would cause him to lose the Republican primary. Lincoln Chaffee is now the Governor of Rhode Island and is an independent."
"That just proves its a horrible idea, whats your point? None of their plans do anything to get costs under control, its ridiculous that a 6 day stay should cost almost $200k."
Yeah soooo many people dont know this.
Its more accurate to drop the republican moniker and call them what they really are...statists. Statists agree with statist ideas.
"What if... just... what if--bear with me here.... What if the individual mandate is bullshit whether the Republicans supported it or not? Why do we keep playing this he said, she said crap instead of actually stopping to take a look at the issue?"
"It has been changed A LOT since then....its not the same bill. TYL. It wouldnt be such a bad idea if it was made optional..you know, as in..the freedom to choose (which is the reason this country exists). If Obamacare is so great, make it optional, and people will flock to it."
[Full circle!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpIM0vFbFck)
"Democrats supported slavery historically too, does that mean all Democrats forever support slavery? Just because Republicans in the 1990s supported the idea (its debatable whether it was just to put up an early defense to UHC) does not mean it is a good idea or that Republicans should forever support it."
"The individual mandate is the cornerstone of Obamacare - Possible Meaning 1: The individual mandate does most of the work in the law with respect to achieving the goals that the law purports to/wants to/purports to want to achieve. This is absolutely and completely false. The real work of the law is being done by a ton of moving pieces, including IPAB and the Medicare expansion. Possible Meaning 2: The law would fall to pieces without the mandate. This is true. Theres basically no way to cover pre-existing conditions without it."
Any chance we can make a subreddit for MotherJones and MediaMatters. There are some things in politics that are interesting but the liberal circlejerks get tiresome.
"And who cares? Bad policy is bad policy, it doesnt matter who its attributed to."
"Its not a conservative idea. Republicans arent conservative, they are neoconservatives."
&gt;well that was originally someone elses idea Worst. Excuse. Ever.
"Just another example illustrating that they dont stand for anything but improving their own positions and getting re-elected. They will love something one minute and then hate it the next if it is politically expedient, and the disinterest and lack of knowledge of the issues of the American electorate makes it easy fro them to go back and forth."
Thank you for demonstrating evidence that there is no difference between Republicans and Democrats. They just put on a sideshow with the help of the media to trick the American people into thinking there is a difference so both parties will remain in power.
Its good to see that the bullshit like articles from Mother Jones arent getting the same amount of up-votes they used to. 
"Obamacare is a bajillion pages long. Its ridiculous to say Republicans supported Obamacare before Obama when you then refer to something that is grossly different. There are fundamental bulletpoints to Obamacare, but unless youre about to show how Obamacare and the idea youre referring to are 100% identical, this article is just more political trash."
"The individual mandate is great for insurance companies. Otherwise, it fucking sucks. Obama promised a health care bill during his 2008 campaign. In order to get one pushed through Congress, he had to compromise to the point of having this individual mandate instead of having a real healthcare system like other western first-world nations. He put form over substance, for the sake of keeping a campaign promise."
Republicans bad! Do I fit in?
but nobody supported the idea of passing massive legislation without reading it... this author needs to give me gum gum
Both parties are bad and many people see this as my team vs yours. This is no different than all the anti-war left who disappeared when Obama was elected.
Who gives a shit if it was their idea over two decades ago the way Obamacare is being implemented with said individual mandate is garbage. 
Their plan was a mandate for individuals to have catastrophic coverage to replace Medicaid and Medicare and not be employer based. We could only wish Obamacare was like that. Think of how a smoking hot our economy would be and how many lives would be saved.
At least a few of them might have been able to support the individual mandate if we hadnt had to pass the bill before we knew what was in it. Democrats screwed the pooch with the sloppy way they passed the ACA and set the stage for the opposition against it the day they passed it without any Republican support.
"Not sure why it matters who supported what in the past. The fact of the matter is, we have this type of healthcare in place, i see few benefits and many problems, what are we going to do to make it better. That should be the focus of the conversation. Not R versus D which is the cause of this mess in the first place."
but dont you understand the difference? the president of the united states is black!
"To be fair, supporting something 25 years ago does not mean they should support it later. Finding out new information and changing ones mind is not necessarily intellectual honesty. It *could* be, but it could also be critical examination given the information at hand. This being politics I doubt its entirely the latter, but its rather unfair to say you supported this decades ago you should support it now is nearly that simple. Democrats supported Jim Crow laws when they were passed. Should they support them now or was there a platform shift and they thought hey this might not be a good idea?"
"Yes, the worst part of the Affordable Care act was originally a Republican idea. Anyone whos been paying attention already knows this, and even if this is news to you I have no idea why anyone would be surprised about this."
Obamacare by itself will bring this country crashing down into financial ruin. If fully implemented I give us 5 years before true financial disaster strikes.
Republicans also used to be against racism and slavery. Things change.
Then... Why did they all vote against it so hard?
Who cares? How is this significant to the current police state and a president who just doesnt give a fuck? 
look like the conservatives win big. SUCK IT LIBERALS
If I recall properly their mandate was that people be responsible for their medical bills and not have them written off. Not compulsory purchase of insurance at levels they may not need. Please correct me if I am wrong as my knowledge of this is all second hand due to being fresh out of the womb at the time Rs were proposing such things
I found it funny to see conservatives back away from it after Romney did it (at the state level anyway). I guess because its arguably unconstitutional it was good fodder during an election. I find it funny to see liberals like it because its going burden the poor the most. The middleclass and the rich already have insurance. I support the individual mandate myself.
"They didnt, to be fair, support the exact bill. "
Which is the real reason it worries me. 
Not quite 100 percent true. What was pushed in the past was a set of incentives to get everyone to be insured. More of a carrot approach than a tick approach. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-02-03/health-individual-mandate-reform-heritage/52951140/1 
And it was a shit idea then too. The only reason its in the Affordable Care Act is because the Republicans wouldnt let us have a more common sense system like PAY YOUR TAXES and ADD EVERYONE TO MEDICARE.
I love how the blame keeps on getting passed. Does it matter? Just get rid of it..
"There is one fundamental flaw I have found with insurance. When insurance is involved the price of things seem to go way up. I am starting to believe this is due to fraud. In Ontario healthcare is covered but things like ambulance rides and semi-private to private room are not covered. However, if no other rooms are available at the hospitals then the semi and private rooms become free. On one occasion my wife was covered for a semi-private room but only a private room was available, the hospital charged her for a semi-private room (covered by insurance) and gave her a discount for the difference of the private room. This is clearly corruption. Thats the flaw with insurance it offers no incentive for the consumer to speak out against corruption. Things like health and car insurance are best done when offered by a monopoly like the government."
"Wait, are you telling me politicians are behaving hypocritically for political reasons? This bit of hypocracy though was old news 4 years ago, why are we discussing it now?"
1. Checkmate ~~athiests christians~~ republicans.
Obama has near compete control over the Republican party. America just hasnt realized it yet and neither have the republicans.
 I prevented my doctors office from committing fraud this morning. I feel good. i will be emailing my doctor who was out of town. I would rather not report the office since I stopped it but there is a part of me that says I should. The office is own by IHA so that is a big company. 
"I dont think Republicans realize that their argument that it was a counter to ___ (i.e. Hillarycare) actually hurts their overall position. What they are saying is, we didnt actually have any plan to do anything about health care. They made us come up with something, you cant hold it against us."
"I like it when liberals start getting desperate.... And one more time for the record, Republican != conservative. Nice try though."
YAY MOTHER JONES!!!! YAY OBAMA! 
"Umm, anyone read how a bunch of doctors nationwide have dropped both private insurance companies and government plans, and cut their costs by half???"
"I love this article, because Ive been saying this for five fucking years."
Obama was elected with a healthcare mandate and ended up passing a healthcare bill that was more right wing than the status quo as it expanded the role of private insurance. Universal Healthcare was inevitable and Obama pushed it back by decades.
Are people not allowed to change their opinion anymore? If I made a decision in the 90s should I be expected to follow that line of thinking literally the rest of my life? 
Haha mother jones 
"What kills me here is the key difference between the heritage foundations mandate and obamas. The heritage mandate would work like auto insurance, it does not matter who you are insured with, as long as your are insured. This was proposed to counter plans that were being pushed by democrats, namely Hillary Clinton which was then later proposed and voted on in 93. This is unlike Obamas mandate which is that if you are not insured through obamacare, you will be fined. You have to pay a fine whether you are insured or not, as long as you dont obamacare you would have to pay a fine. The difference in the two mandates is that the heritage foundation forces you into free market healthcare and Obamas forces you into government healthcare. That being said I disagree with both so dont take this as Im taking sides. "
We force drivers to have auto insurance. Why are Republicans never enraged about that?
"The differences between Romneycare and Obamacare: 1. Romneycare aimed to insure everyone in Massachusetts, Obamacare aims to take over and regulate the insurance industry. 2. Romneycare is enforced by MassHealth, Obamacare is enforced by the IRS (which was recently busted for targeting conservative groups.) 3. Romneycare had bipartisan support, Obamacare didnt. 4. Romneycare was funded, Obamacare is not. 5. Romneycares constitutionality was upheld in court, Obamacare was ruled unconstitutional 2X. 6. Dont like Romneycare? Try another state. Dont like Obamacare? Tough."
"Yeah but NOW its good, right? Since Obama did it?"
"Take out For Profit insurance and I might be on board. As soon as someone has to profit on my health, we lose."
Paying for insurance: requirement. Having a job: non-requirement. 
"Yep,,,and this is why they will NEVER stop sounding like theyre full of shit. "
How do folks who were previously for the Individual Mandate who have now flipped on the issue explain their recent change in opinion toward it? (That is to say if the change wasnt caused by them not wanting to agree with a Democratic Presidents Suggestion)
"Republicans and Democrats...one in the same, both for a larger overbearing government."
This is what happens when both parties compete of the same special interest.
Just because somebody supported a concept in the past does not mean that they should blindly follow its final implemented form. This is especially true if they believe that it bears only a passing similarity to the original concept or if the concept is accompanied with many destructive policies.
Is it 2012 or are we talking about something that matters?
"I wish theyd call it something else. Its on par with saying, Oh, I have Hitlercare, Im much more special, or, Hey, I have Stalincare, fuck you are your comrades, or, You gringos have nothing on Castrocare. Why not call it Gubmentcare? "
"Both sides of the aisle are corporately owned, and blindly follow an invisible sky fairy. They do not, in any way, represent the electorate. The best thing we can hope for is that they ALL get sent home packing."
Wait. So you mean to tell me that democrats are parading around a republican idea and theyre proud of it?
I love this. Make it look like a right wing thing. They will believe anything.
Proposed by conservatives does not equal conservative idea. Just like liberal Obama droning people doesnt make droning people a liberal idea...necessarily &gt;:)
So why are you democrats supporting this crap?
Maybe some republicans may want it but we all know we cant afford it.
"25 RINOs Who Supported Obamacare Before Obama There, fixed it for you..."
I dont care who came up with it first. I still think its a s***ty idea.
And it was a shitty idea then. 
"In 2008 Obama campaigned AGAINST the individual mandate... So if he can be against it, then *of course* the republicans would have been for it."
&gt; The folks here deserve more attention from their government The NSA is giving them plenty of attention. /s
"Actually the deficit is shrinking, quite substantially. Example support: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/05/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-federal-deficit-growing/ Misinformation on spending and the deficit is why none of the other issues in your comment will be addressed anytime soon."
"Let other countries take care of it. Again, put on your own oxygen mask before your childs."
"Still doesnt justify intervention. Its like how they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask in a plane before securing your childs. Syria has a problem and it seems like theyre not able to resolve it among themselves in a civilized way, and thats bad. But the US is in deep shit right now. Crumbling infrastructure, mediocre education system, horrible health care system, rapidly rising inequality, rapidly rising deficit, and the vast majority of its young people drowning in education-related debts. Come the fuck on. Im not a US citizen, but I am living in the US right now. The folks here deserve more attention from their government. They deserve a government that will look after them. Their government has sunk trillions into nation-building in the Middle East, and thus far with little success. Fucking spend some money back home, where millions are struggling. War on Iraq, War on Afghanistan, War on Libya, War on Drugs... fuck, wheres the fucking War on Poverty folks want in the US?"
Chemical weapon attacks on a civilian population dont justify an intervention? Fuck off. 
"Fair point, I did not know that. That is actually good news."
ding ding ding! The cap is awful. It means that I put 7% of my income into social security and somebody who makes 10x what I do only puts in .7% (figures completely made up for illustration).
"The only way that would be mathematically possible would be if you made $113,700 and someone else made $1,137,000. You would both pay $7,049.40 into social security. This is also only on payroll taxes. There are maybe a couple thousand people in the US that get paid that kind of money. Most of the people that make &gt;$1MM/year get it through capital gains or equity compensation (Stock options). Also, for anyone who earns less than six figures, you are likely to get out WAY more than you ever paid in. [Heres a good resource](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/01/medicare-and-social-security-what-you-paid-what-yo/) This just in.... program that cuts monthly checks to tens of millions of people every month wildly popular. Up next: Santa Claus approval ratings at an all time high."
"Maybe the House would do so if Senator Reid would bring to the floor, for an up or down vote, one of the many budgets that the House has passed these past few years. The Senate has not passed a budget, prior to this Spring, since April 29, 2009. It works both ways. Both parties are to blame for our current circumstances. http://www.politifact.com/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/28/bob-corker/bob-corker-says-senate-has-not-passed-budget-more-/"
"Possibly because people are sick of small committees being granted inordinate amounts of power? If the Senate is that willing to compromise, why not simply pass a budget from the house without major alteration?"
"Thats basically what the Senate passed, that the House is now rejecting! The House added another goal to any deal, and that was Obamacare gets defunded. The Senate wants to pass a continuing resolution for $986 billion. The House Republicans rallied around the Ryan Budget, which was $967 billion. The original Obama requested budget was $1.2 trillion. Senate is trying to pass a house budget without any major alteration. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/03/how-the-white-house-sees-the-shutdown-and-debt-ceiling-fight/"
"For the last 6 months, the Senate has been trying to go to conference with the House over an approved-Senate budget, that Boehner refuses to bring up. The Senate has accepted funding levels that are very close to the Ryan Budget at 967$ billion. The Senate has agreed to accept the lower-level funding post-sequestration."
Even more shameful.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/01/why-boehner-doesnt-just-ditch-the-right/ This is a good convo about why hes doing what hes doing.
"He shouldnt even be speaker. It should be a democrat considering that in 2012 house democrats actually received 1.17 million more total votes, yet had minority representation due to redistricting. [Source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/)"
Its not even his job as representative he holds in higher esteem than all of us currently furloughed....he would keep that. Its his position as speaker.
"Yes and no. Boehner is following the Hastert rule which says that no vote can be brought to the floor of the House unless a majority of the party that holds the majority of the House agrees to it. There are enough Tea Party Republicans to block it there. Boehner has ignored the Hastert rule in the past, but he knows that if he ignores it this time, he will be removed as Speaker of the House and be replaced by one of those very same Tea Party Republicans. The votes to replace him will take happen before any budget vote, so he knows that once hes replaced theyll be right back to square one, but with a Speaker who isnt working to build up a compromise to move forward."
"Speaker Boehner is completely at fault for this then. Holding his job in higher esteem than 800,000 Americans. "
"&gt; Considering the USPS hasnt taken a dime of taxpayer money since 1972, I was talking about the experience of private postal service in other countries. You are somewhat correct in that the USPS [doesnt run on much taxpayer money on the official budget](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/jul/24/american-postal-workers-union/postal-service-claim-not-fully-target/) (just about $100 million for free postage for citizens over seas and the blind), but it has borrowed billions of dollars from the U.S. Treasury and since it cant repay its massive debt, [it is currently asking for a taxpayer bailout.](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/03/20/postal-service-bailout-usps-billions-in-red-as-lawmakers-push-reform/). There is also the opportunity cost of given it an official monopoly, such that it is [*illegal*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service#Universal_service_obligation_and_monopoly_status) to start a rival company which could charge people lower rates. So there is an implicit tax as well. "
"&gt; it has borrowed billions of dollars from the U.S. Treasury and since it cant repay its massive debt Not really relevant to the discussion, but that massive debt was thanks to Congress passing a law forcing them to pre-fund *75 years* worth of retiree benefits in something like 6 years, something that is completely unheard of anywhere else in public or private sector organizations. Guess whos been giving tons of money to the congresscritters behind that one? UPS and FedEx."
"Considering the USPS hasnt taken a dime of taxpayer money since 1972 (they are completely self-funded), I dont see how privatizing it could possibly cost taxpayers even less."
"&gt;However the fact that none of the Bush era policies on national security [Dont need to take your word when I can look at his promises and outcomes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/subjects/homeland-security/).

As for [poverty](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/subjects/poverty/) feel free to peruse his promises. This stuff is easy to look up, so keep that in mind before you say patently false things that are easily verifiable. It is one thing to say Obama didnt do this specific thing x or I think Obama should have done more on specific thing Y but to say nothing has changed is just so easily refuted and kills your credibility in a discussion"
"First of all I didnt only say that nothing has changed, I also said that there wasnt any real difference between Obama and McCain or Romney. Edit: missed a word.

"With Obama in office the rich and wall street firms have prospered greatly, even through a financial disaster. While the poverty rate is the highest its ever been in the last 50 years. I was one of the people fooled by the illusion that dems are for the little guy while republicans are for big business. However the fact that none of the Bush era policies on national security, whistle blower treatment, financial policies or much of anything actually changed under Obama. This proves, to me at least, that having voted for him has not landed me or the country in a different position than had I voted for Romney, or McCain."

"&gt; Unpaid? So the members of the armed forces havent been getting paid this entire time? We arent spending money taking care of the veterans that come home from war? We arent paying the contractors helping manufacture the equipment used to make war? People are getting paid. The wars ARE being paid for. Seriously? The govt has been borrowing an unprecedented amount of money to pay for the wars. They now have to pay that money back somehow, eventually. Hence, the wars are considered unpaid for. I dont understand whats so difficult to grasp about the concept. &gt; Tax breaks dont go to citizens. Tax breaks allow citizens to keep more of their money from the government. And, yes, the rich, seeing as they pay far more in taxes, get to keep far more of their money. All money doesnt automatically belong to the government. Look, I know that nobody likes paying taxes, least of all the rich. Thats a pretty solid part of the reason theyre so rich anyways.

"&gt;Dude, federal revenues went up after the Bush tax cuts. Stop ignoring this. CBO, Nov. 14, 2001: Individual income tax receipts fell by $10 billion, or 1.0 percent, in fiscal year 2001.

In fact, total federal revenues declined in fiscal year 2001 for the first time since 1983, mainly because of the Bush tax cuts.

"So if we had a budget surplus, you can show me where the national debt decreased, right?"
"As many have said, most of your statements are false. Since everyone else just rebuffed them, I will provide sources. &gt; Weve had a budget deficit since 1835. False. Clinton ran a surplus for 3 years which Bush inherited. And under that plan would have the entire debt paid off within a few decades. Source: http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/ Maybe youre referring to the federal debt? &gt; Unpaid? This is a matter of semantics, but generally if you have to increase your liabilities to pay for a good, that good is considered to be unpaid until the liability is settled. Sure the provider of the good receives money for it and thus gets paid, you are still balance sheet negative. For instance, if you buy a new car and take out a loan to pay for it, the dealer still gets the money for the car, but you dont get the title for it until its paid off. This makes it difficult to say you have paid for your car until you pay back the loan. Source: basic household finance &gt; I honestly dont know anything about Medicare Part D and, chances are, neither do you. Moving on... Quick education for you: medicare part d was a large prescription drug benefit expansion of medicare. Unfortunately, there was no corresponding increase in medicare collections (taxes) to pay for those benefits and it also prevented the government from negotiating drug prices with drug manufacturers. More info: http://www.factcheck.org/2011/08/more-mediscare/ &gt; Did you guys know that, after the Bush tax cuts, federal revenues actually went up? Also false. Its easier to just link to the gross federal receipts for the years before and after the tax cuts were implemented. The bush tax cuts were implemented in 2001 so watch what happened to 2001 and 2002 revenues. Source: http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/revenue_chart_2000_2006USk_11s1li011lcn_F0t Sorry the facts dont support your statements, and I would have been able to put this together for you sooner, but Im just on my phone while I snuggle my newborn back to sleep. "
"Actually, you CAN blame deficits on tax cuts, because less tax revenue will ALWAYS increase debt for a given level of spending. The supposedly fiscally conservative Republicans massively increased the deficit during Dubyas presidency. Medicare part D is the prescription drug benefit that Dubya pushed for, and it is completely unfunded. I wish we had a balanced budged amendment just so Republicans couldnt pull this shit."
We are borrowing money to pay for many government programs. Whats the point in singling out the military? Thats my point.
"&gt; So youd be able to show me where the national debt decreased under Clinton, right? After all, if we actually had a budget surplus, the debt would decrease, right? Right? [FactCheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/) has a quick breakdown of the Clinton years as far as deficit spending went. Also, national debt isnt just as easy as pay this guy back when we have money. Contrary to popular belief, the U.S. budget is not in any way similar to a household budget."
"&gt;False. Clinton ran a surplus for 3 years which Bush inherited. And under that plan would have the entire debt paid off within a few decades. And, yet, under the surplus of the Republican Congress, the national debt - year to year - never went down, did it? How do you have a surplus without the debt going down? &gt;This is a matter of semantics, but generally if you have to increase your liabilities to pay for a good, that good is considered to be unpaid until the liability is settled. True, but you can classify many government programs, under this definition, as unpaid for. Its just easy to single out the military. &gt;Also false. Its easier to just link to the gross federal receipts for the years before and after the tax cuts were implemented. The bush tax cuts were implemented in 2001 so watch what happened to 2001 and 2002 revenues. There were TWO rounds of Bush tax cuts. After the [second rounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts), the federal revenues increased - as your chart so helpfully points out."
"Few erm, issues... &gt;Weve had a budget deficit since 1835. And therefore...? Irrelevant to whether or not we would have had a balanced budget if not for ridiculous economic decisions. &gt; Unpaid? So the members of the armed forces havent been getting paid this entire time? We arent spending money taking care of the veterans that come home from war? We arent paying the contractors helping manufacture the equipment used to make war? People are getting paid. The wars ARE being paid for. Yes, money was going out. Id like you to show where those outlays were included in the regular budgets. (Hint: they werent) &gt;I honestly dont know anything about Medicare Part D and, chances are, neither do you. Well, appeals to ignorance are a type of argument, I suppose. Not a terribly convincing one. And yes, enactment immediately put a big divot in the budget. &gt;Did you guys know that, after the Bush tax cuts, federal revenues actually went up? The actual problem was that spending increased at a greater pace. Including things like, paying for soldiers and weapons for military adventures that were occurring off-budget, among others? I recognize that Im likely arguing with a taxation-as-theft type, which means this wont ultimately get anywhere, but you addressed misinformation with real misinformation here."
"Federal revenues increased from around 2003-2008, though. AFTER the Bush tax cuts. "
"&gt; So youd be able to show me where the national debt decreased under Clinton, right? Sure. [Here you go.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/US_Federal_Debt_as_Percent_of_GDP_by_President.jpg)"
You live in a very black-and-white world.
"&gt; Weve had a budget deficit since 1835. The US Government ran a budget surplus from 1998-2001. &gt; Unpaid? So the members of the armed forces havent been getting paid this entire time? He means, unpaid for because the federal government didnt offset the ongoing expense of the war with budget cuts or tax increases. If you borrow money to buy dinner the dinner is unpaid for by you, since you still owe the money, not because the restaurant owner hasnt gotten his cash. &gt; I honestly dont know anything about Medicare Part D and, chances are, neither do you. Thats the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, written into the law in 2003. It famously prevents the Federal Government from negotiating about the cost of the prescription drugs it pays for. &gt; Tax breaks dont go to citizens. Semantics. Tax breaks are targeted at different sectors of the population, depending on policy goals. If I pass a law cutting taxes on the owners of golden retrievers, those cuts go to them. &gt; Did you guys know that, after the Bush tax cuts, federal revenues actually went up? The first tax cut was signed in 2001. After that point, federal tax revenue declined for three straight years."
And what happened to federal revenues between around 2003 and 2009? Remember there were multiple Bush tax cuts. One in 2001 and another in 2003.
"&gt;Weve had a budget deficit since 1835. I thought Clinton managed a surplus? &gt;Unpaid? So the members of the armed forces havent been getting paid this entire time? The wars ARE being paid for.

Reality is that after the tax breaks rich people had more and the government less money. Again you fail to grasp Sanders argument. "
"&gt; After all, if we actually had a budget surplus, the debt would decrease, right? Right? You are ignorant of the difference between deficit and debt. Deficit was reduced. Debt was not (and could not have been in that short time frame). No, budget surplus does not equal debt decrease. Cmon, this is pretty basic stuff."
"&gt;?The reason we?re in a deficit today is two unpaid wars, Medicare Part D program, unpaid for, large tax breaks, $1 trillion of which went to the wealthy,? he said. ?As we go forward to figure out where we want to be as priorities, you?ve got to remember that fact as well.? There is so much wrong with this statement. I cant believe it came from a sitting Senator. Sigh. Lets break this down: &gt;The reason we?re in a deficit today Weve had a budget deficit since 1835. &gt;is two unpaid wars Unpaid? So the members of the armed forces havent been getting paid this entire time? We arent spending money taking care of the veterans that come home from war?

Yes. I tend to look at things in a very down-to-earth manner. Politicians want to inject a whole bunch of other stuff to make things as complex for us plebes as possible.
"We are borrowing money to pay for the wars. Hence, the wars are not paid for. But people are getting paid is quite possibly the silliest argument I have ever heard. "

Im about to see progressivism swept under the electoral rug this November, never to be relevant again in my life time. If you want to feel pity, you should pity the people that Obama betrayed with his shoddy execution as the chief executive, and the everlasting damage he did to the progressive ideology."

"As a person with a chronic illness and a full time job, the future frightens me. I now have to kiss my employers ass, because if I lose my job, Ill be bankrupt in a year if I have to pay out if pocket for healthcare. This country is so backwards in how it deals with illness. "
"Obama gave the corporate elite a decision: Either provide healthcare, or go to a 29 hour work week. It use to be 60, then 50, then 40, then it just kind of got stuck at 40 hours for some reason. This finally prodded it to under 30. Too bad we still dont get healthcare."
"&gt;in an interview last month on Fox?s ?Your World,? Hall argued that the real unemployment rate was significantly higher than the official number, at least 3 percentage points more. This always confuses me. What exactly is this magical real unemployment rate, and how does it different from the various precisely defined [unemployment rates](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm) the BLS publishes? * *U-1* Persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer, as a percent of the civilian labor force * *U-2* Job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs, as a percent of the civilian labor force * *U-3* Total unemployed, as a percent of the civilian labor force (official unemployment rate) * *U-4* Total unemployed plus discouraged workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers * *U-5* Total unemployed, plus discouraged workers, plus all other persons marginally attached to the labor force, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force * *U-6* Total unemployed, plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force, plus total employed part time for economic reasons, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force U-3 is the official unemployment rate, but obviously it doesnt include people who want a job but gave up looking (marginally attached) and people who are involuntarily part-time workers. In the article, Hall waives his hands around the Civilian Employment-Population Ratio but that number also includes people who dont have to work and arent looking for work (ie, retired, students, housewives, and so on). Really we already have a statistic that includes everything hes looking for: *U-6*. Heres how U-6 did over the past few months: July12 14.9 Mar13 13.8 Apr13 13.9 May13 13.8 Jun13 14.3 July13 14.0 So U-6 has gone up recently, probably for some of the reasons Hall is talking about. However, it is better than a year ago. My main point though is that we dont need to be referring to new confusing statistics when the BLS basically lays it out every month. **Edit:** in fact since the only difference between U-5 and U-6 is involuntary part-time workers, we can show the involuntary part-time worker rate by doing U-6 minus U-5: July12 5.2 Mar13 4.9 Apr13 5.0 May13 5.0 Jun13 5.2 July13 5.2 So yeah, no improvement over the last year. However, youd expect this number to scale along with total number of people employed, so staying steady implies that the percentage of *employed people* who are involuntarily underemployed is shrinking."
"Where do we stand now, in the ongoing death of the US middle class - is this, like the middle part?"
They said they would create jobs; they didnt say that it would be full-time.
Can confirm. Just got a part-time job as a recent college grad. 
"What are the other 3 percent? contract, temp, and paid internship work?"
"You know, eventually prices will drop because nobody is working full time anymore and so nobodys making enough to buy anything. This has to balance out at a point. Its already starting to happen with rents where I live (Vancouver). In the meantime it means that a lot of people have a lot of extra time. Thats tons of time to read, create, volunteer, protest, and generally improve ourselves and the world. That, and play video games, of course. I work half-time and I love it. Dont take me the wrong way, though. If I wasnt making a livable wage, Id be seriously depressed and pissed off. "
"Hours-per-week just creates a threshold for employers to limbo under. Make the cutoff 20 and every employee gets scheduled 19. If employers had to provide health benefits for all workers (regardless of hours worked), I have a feeling every job would be a full-time job (though there would probably be half as many of them). "
"Yet they demand full-time results, at the very least."
"Gotta love working in education, where everyone gets treated right and our liberal arts skills get put to use. The real world can suck a dick."

And its only going to get worse when ObamaCare starts to be implemented on businesses. Welcome to the part time economy.
"I assumed the percentage was high, but 97% ?! Holy shit."
"After the new laws that govern health care for employees working 30 hours there is absolutely nobody right now hiring full time workers unless youve already got an established career path going. Like if youre in college or out of high school there are no full time jobs. Most jobs are maybe 20-29 hours max. And that 29 is the absolute tippy top, so just to be safe theyll keep you at 25 or 26 a week. It really fucks me over personally because here I am, three years IT experience, ive had my hands in all sorts of stuff and I had people offering me 8.75 at 20 hours and acting like they were being generous. Its really weird out here because sometimes youll get an outlier position that says Hey well only give you 20 hours but well do 20 bucks an hour as part of our college internship program. and those jobs go faster than tickets at comic con. "
As predicted.
"This figure appears to have been arrived at by dividing the total number of new part-time jobs by the net job gain. If you wanted an honest figure, you would divide new part-time jobs by the total number of jobs created."
http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2013/08/14/jobs-a14.html Report: 97 percent of new US jobs are part-time 
Im convinced that this recovery were experiencing is anything but that. I have friends who are actively seeking employment and its tough out there. I am SOOO grateful to have a good full time job.
"Before college: Hey, you better go to college. You dont want to end up working at Burger King do you? After college: What, you too good to work at Burger King?"
Hello! Im a bot who mirrors websites if they go down due to being posted on reddit. [Here is a screenshot of the website](http://i.imgur.com/lhaxxLM.jpg). *Please feel free to PM me your comments/suggestions/hatemail.*
"I am curious as to who is to blame here. It seems like this is a culmination of numerous factors that were either ignored or downplayed in significance. Most notably, Im sure no one could have predicted how quickly technological advancements made it possible for machines/robots to replace human labor. I could be wrong about that, but it seems this trend has exponentially grown at a rate that would be difficult to keep up. The rise of the information and big data age means that fewer jobs are on the market because just a few BIG players can trickle down information by collecting (for free I might add) it from the masses. Think Google, Amazon, etc. They are in the business of big data, largely on the backs of individuals who are not compensated for what they input. This is tricky, because consumers love the ability to use services for free or low cost, without realizing that they are sucking dry jobs essential to them. We must change our economy to represent this shift if we hope to maintain a middle-class. A lot of this is explained in a great book by Jaron Lanier in [Who Owns The Future.](http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Future-Jaron-Lanier/dp/1451654960) "
70% of economic activity is CONSUMER based. Is this surprising to anyone?
"Well considering my job is part time and I work 39.75 hours a week, Im really not surprised."
The company Im currently working for is like 80% temp jobs that work full-time. Go figure...
"Dont forget contract/temp work too where people do the same job as others but a temp company gets a cut of their pay, they get no rights to keep their job, no seniority and no benefits. Kelly services is now the nations second largest employer......"
"Thats fine. Think of the savings on employee benefits that will increase profits for shareholders. As far as the discourse on TV is concerned, the income of the owning class is sacred, the income of the working class is irrelevant. "
"Its slavery Jim, but not as we know it."
Solution: Single-payer health care
No wonder so many people have time to be on Reddit.
"Can confirm. Ive gotten about 5 job offers in the last month or so, and all of them were either on call, part time or temporary "
This cant be surprising. They knew when they implemented the 30-hour rule in Obamacare without any kind of teeth preventing companies from artificially keeping employee hours under the mark that this was going to happen. I just hope that it wasnt intentional on the part of the administration for jobs numbers... Best way to fix this is to give that portion of Obamacare teeth.
"Can you feel it trickling down, America?"
"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/aug/07/truths-behind-part-time-jobs-and-recovery/ This year sucks for full time, but on the whole way more full time jobs have appeared/reappeared since the crash than part time. I think were starting to see a part-time ramp up to meet increased demand in some sectors, and if it keeps up some of those may get converted to full time, though god knows the people who will have to pay them more and also now give them healthcare coverage will fight it tooth and nail."

The economy is going to collapse soon.
government is not the answer. [Im probably going to get nuked into oblivion. ] 
"Obama creates jobs. Also, freedom. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;"
This is not remotely reflected on job search websites. Perhaps things quoted from Fox News interviews could be suspect.
Report: Over 92% of reports written are not supported by actual data.
How much of this is a result of Obamacare? Food for thought...
Its mainly because minimum wage is to high. If people were paid 1$ a day like in China there would be plenty of full time jobs in sweatshops. 
I had a very easy time finding a 45 hour per week job with no degree.
Welcome to the new castrated American economy. 
**Obamascare!**
So there are plenty of part time jobs for everyone to have two of them (or three). Keeping on kicking ass America! Doing great!
In President Obamas America there are super rich big government Democrats like Hillary and Barack and Harry Reid setting punishing policy for the disregarded masses. The ruling elites know best whats good for their subjects and part time labor keeps the little people voting hoping for handouts.
This is the fault of George Bush single-handedly tanking the economy!! And then people expect Obama to clean up this mess. The president doesnt control the entire economy like all the teatards think!!
This couldnt have anything to do with a little mandate about employees over 29 hours could it. Maybe? no? huh.. Seems someone mention this would happen. 
Hope and Change hard at work... or golfing.. not sure. 
"Could liberals please stop trying to scheme ways to take from the productive and give to the unproductive. Nobody is responsible for your kids, health, happiness, etc but YOU. Just get out of my god damn life and let me live free!"
Thats about 10 feathers in obamas cap this week. 
We should cut taxes more and deregulate more because it is so clearly working.
"The next step is to deduct money from your paycheck for the privilege of working there. Another words, instead of them paying you to work, youre paying them to work."
This is why Obamacare needs to be amended to take into account full-time equivalents rather than just whether an individual employee is full time. Then it wont matter if you hire two people at 20 hours/wk a piece. They will still be a full time equivalent.
This is my shocked face. :O Are you saying that since Full time workers became significantly more expensive due to health care costs people have stopped creating jobs for them? 
This is because quantitative easing works... NOT!
Id like the Thanks Obama Meme to become Fuck You Obama thanks.
My company canned 3 full-time positions because of Obamacare. Half of one salary was eaten up just doing a full assessment of what it will do to our business. This is not surprising in the least. Its downright scary.
Ew. Gross
QE for the win
"You know, in general, when an economy is starting to recover, the first thing most employers do when demand goes up is hire either part-time workers or temp workers. They have more demand so they need more workers, but they arent confident enough yet to make the commitment necessary to hire people full-time. Generally speaking, most economists consider an increase in part-time workers, temp workers, and overtime work to be a leading indicator that implies that the number of full-time workers will be increasing soon. "
"Even our Congress, half of the times, they are not in session. But they get paid a whole lot more than Burger King. Plus they have free gym and free lunch."
Slavery: the future of America.
"Wow, talk about a real kick in the groin to Republicans determined to prevent economic recovery (i.e., they killed decent jobs AND job creation...woo-hoo?) and the lukewarm efforts this President and Democratic leadership have expended toward job creation efforts since 2008. How many times does Free Market theory have to fail before those who embrace it realize it DOES NOT WORK in practice?"
Thanks Obama.
"Oh, and how many hours per week are those so called part-time jobs? The issue will continue to be low wages. "
I like that the World Socialist Website uses Fox News as a source. Its like the media has finally congealed into one tub of political goo yogurt.

Welcome to Obamas America.
THIS IS FUCKING GREAT NEWS. THERE IS A NEW PARADIGM SHIFT TOWARDS THE 20 HOUR WORK WEEK. HOW FUCKING GREAT IS THAT? WE CAN WORK HALF AS MUCH AS OUR IDIOT FATHERS AND GRANDFATHERS DID. AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAA DO YOU PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO WORK 40 HOURS OF EVERY WEEK? 24% OF YOUR LIFE? WHY NOT 12%? 9-5? HOW ABOUT 9-1? HOW FUCKING GREAT DOES 9-1 WORK DAY SOUND? IT SOUNDS FUCKING WONDERFUL TO ME. WHO CARES IF YOU MAKE HALF AS MUCH? YOU ARE ALSO WORKING HALF AS MUCH! MORE FREE TIME! BE WITH YOUR FAMILY! READ A BOOK! TAKE A WALK! RIDE A BIKE! EXPLORE YOUR WORLD! MAKE A FRIEND! TAKE A CLASS!

funny to see a thread like this on THIS place. eat it up. reap what you sow.

"Yet, I still dont have one."
Still beats 0% or less
The reason there part time is so companys dont have to pay for health care saving them money it all comes down to greed and paying into Obama care dissent help either
Reason: Obamacare
"Redditors should love this, more time to spend on reddit, smoke weed, and publish communist manifestos."
The worst part is how many of my fellow Americans blame their fellow man for falling on hard times.
[That number seems a bit high...](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/03/part-time-work-july-jobs_n_3700930.html) &gt;Part-time work has made up 77 percent of the job growth so far this year. The government defines part-time work as being less than 35 hours a week.
Bullshit. Every week they make it 10% higher to sensationalize. I bet next week it will say 110% of new jobs are part time!!!!

"Did anyone else see the Bill Maher episode where he had a guest (someone who frequently appears on the ol boob tube) say how there are like 100k jobs in agriculture open, but no one has the skills. This is scary stuff. *He says as he interns for a digitial ad agency* "
"This GOP lawmaker has convinced me of nothing. I have been following this debate for several years and the overwhelming evidence supporting the idea that women are not paid less for the same work convinced me. The shell game is the one constantly harped on by the sexists. They constantly conflate getting paid less for the same work and getting paid less for different work and expect people to not understand the difference. The simple fact of the matter is that if someone makes choices which cause them to make less money(not getting a degree, not being a world class athlete etc.) then they should get paid less if that is something that is relevant to their job. Women take more time off of work, they work less dangerous jobs, they leave the workforce more often, they get lowerpaying degrees, the negotiate less, they go into lower paying jobs, they commute less and they work more flexible hours. All these things among many others contribute to the pay gap. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-women-are-paid-77-cents-dolla/ http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-women-make-77-cents-/"
"Again --- shell game. Equal pay is about equal pay for the SAME WORK. Women get paid less for the SAME WORK. Not entering a field commonly populated by men is not at issue here. Youre suggesting that because women dont become construction workers (for example) then they should be paid less as marketing execs, as call center employees, as clerical staff etc. We men make different choices in life too. A person rarely fits into the he-man stereotype he is brought up into and told to be. Should we then pay muscular people more then computer nerds because of the choices they made. Should fat people be paid less? Should old people? How about the nearsighted? Bad drivers? Those who drink? Where does it end? Simply put, while this GOP lawmaker has apparently successfully convinced you the pay gap is because women just dont want to work at jobs that are designed from inception for men, because women were never part of the workforce when they were created, the real battle that MOST women are fighting is the ability to be paid an EQUAL amount for EQUAL amount of work. The attempt to derail the conversation by bringing up female laziness, and then blaming the gap ON THEM is ridiculous and completely transparent. Speaking of transparency, most equal pay advocate measures simply wish to empower all employees to see what their counterparts take home so that things like discrimination based on gender (along with a whole host of other issues) could be brought to light. I think its pretty obvious why this is so strongly apposed, but as someone who once worked in a payroll department I can tell you too many people are being taken advantage of by their employer. Too many people are getting paid WAY below their counterparts simply because this transparency doesnt exist. In fact, Im quite certain, had their been women who worked at the grate company I worked for, I probably would have found they were underpaid more then any other group. By law we arent supposed to discriminate with pay or when hiring, and too many employees are doing just that. "
"How much did the premiums rise, year-on-year, before obamacare?"
"According to the Kaiser foundation and NPR, 4% per year. According to Factcheck.org 9% a year (Which show you how partisan and unreliable they really are. Most of the sources say 4%. CBO says 6% increases will be the norm."

Dont forget Benghazi so easily like reddit tends to do
"&gt;His campaign was a scam and we probably discovered too late. Are you fucking kidding me? Reddit was all about Gravel/Kucinich in 2008, Obama was *not* liked widely. The mainstream media acted as a cheerleader for Obama/Clinton and cut off/ignored most of what Gravel and Kucinich had to say. Of course this will be downvoted to hell, but I remember the mood around the election very well. The media basically picked the Democratic candidates for us, and they shut down the others by not letting them speak at the debates/slandering their positions. "
"The Republicans love the word *transparent* except when Darrell Issa has to release all the testimony. It was a favorite word of criminal mindermast James OKeefe for instance. &gt; Everything you need to know about how the Obama administration has been run is told by how theyve acted with this scandal. I disagree. I think what they did is consistent with what Obama has always said: no searches without a warrant. This, despite Politifacts, claim has not changed. "
"Just wondering, is anyone now starting to go back and question the motives behind some of his other policies? Such as the Affordable Care Act?"
"&gt; His campaign was a scam and we probably discovered too late. The NSA had surveilled him during his campaign. Do you think he was lying while campaigning, or did he sell his soul a some point after his campaign promise for no warrantless wiretapping?"
"Everything you need to know about how the Obama administration has been run is told by how theyve acted with this scandal. Lied through his teeth and then had to be silent, because anything he says is going to look bad from now on. His campaign was a scam and we probably discovered too late."
I mean we as Americans. I have never really believed that this president would live up to his promises and I dont think any current Democrat or Republican would.
"The FISA court system is not transparent. There is no way to dance around that fact, he is 100% lying when he says it is. "
"but why? why did you discover too late? Lets look forward to 2016. Who is going to be running on the democratic ticket? Are you going to believe Hillary when she tells you that what we need is a big change and she is here to deliver? Or Biden or Cuomo? Ok, you probably wont believe Hillary, but shes better than Chris Christie or that cuban guy, right? So its an emotional issue. Or what if Al Gore steps in as the savior of the day? Are you going to believe him when he tells you his job creation plan goes hand in hand with his plan to save us all from the imminent destruction presented by melting glaciers? How many of you are going to remember the let down you are currently experiencing when it comes time to make this decision again? How many of you are going to let yourselves be lead back into the bipartisan dichotomy where you feel compelled to vote against the candidate you are more scared of, rather than standing up and being a real participating member of a democracy?"
"I wouldnt say that his campaign was a scam. I think hes been a moderately good president. There was wiretapping during Clinton, the suspension of Habeus Corpus during Lincoln, and the Alien and Seditions Act under John Adams. I truly feel bad for Obama, because he is out there doing a million things and after he approves one thing (that in actuality doesnt change anything) people decide to bash his whole presidency. Heres another link to [PolitiFact] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/) for some perspective on just how many promises hes broken. "
"What specific statements were lies? I agree with Politifact, that the NSA is clearly not transparent although transparent is somewhat of a relative term when were talking about one of Americas super secret spy agencies (of which there are what, 50 now?). What are some bold faced lies from Obama? I do expect exaggerations and wishful thinking from all politicians but theres just no comparison in the level of truthfullness from each side of the aisle. "

"He can not remove marijuana from the controlled substance act completely only lower it to schedule 2, maybe schedule 3. The US is a signor of the [Single Convention on Narcotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs#Schedule_I). This international treaty lists schedules for all narcotics that all signors agree to uphold. Marijuana is listed as schedule I though in this treaty schedule I is not as strict as the US definition of schedule I. In the treaty schedule I means restricted to medical use only, absolutely forbid from purchase without a prescription. Other schedule I drugs in the treaty are things like morphine, heroin, oxycodin, etc. In order to remove marijuana from schedule in the US, ie allow full recreational sale, the US would need to abrogate the treaty which can only be done by a vote in congress or the treaty allows for drugs to be rescheduled upon WHO recommendations which i doubt will happen. If Obama removes marijuana from schedule and allows recreational sale he is in violation of an international treaty that was approved by congress which is an impeachable offense. He does have the power to lower it to schedule II making all medical dispensaries legal under federal law"
"What actually makes it against the law? The fact it is a class 1 substance? I mean, I doubt they have a different law on the books for every possible drug."
"and no matter what schedule he makes it, the penalty for possession remains the same, because schedules mean abso-fucking-lutely nothing in terms of punishment. schedule 1 means the fda recognizes no medical use for it. While that is a bit silly given that several states have legalized medical use, and it clearly has one, you are doing the cause no favors by spreading misinformation. This doesnt evne go into the fact that most people charged with possession are charged on the state level, and feds rarely deal with it at all..."
"And he may be priming the pump for just such a move. For example, president makes a statement that he thinks gays should have the right to marry, then several months later, the justice department takes action around the issue."
"Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order. Thats entirely within his authority. To 100% legalize and regulate, yes, he would need Congress. But dont act as if the President is without any options in regard to marijuana policy. That would be incredibly inaccurate. "
"Different drugs are scheduled differently. Heroin, for example, is a schedule 1 drug. Comes with harsher criminal penalties when caught with it. Cocaine, oddly, is a schedule 2 drug. LOL"
Your comment is willfully ignorant for the sake of being inflammatory. You already know the arguments against executive order but you continue to parrot his failure the use of it for the sole purpose of being of inflammatory and drawing attention to yourself.

"&gt; Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order. the problem with doing this is that the next president can come in and make an executive order to reschedule it. so, lets say obama deschedules it by the end of 2014. suddenly medical dispensaries are opening up everywhere. then, the new president comes in 2017 and reverses what he did w/ an executive order. now its a rather sticky situation. obama wants congress to act on it. that way, if it wants to get changed again, it has to go through congress again. basically, it doesnt mean much if he removes it from schedule 1."
Which could be undone just as easily. Executive orders only hold as long as that President is in office. Past that any president could override it with another order. However its harder to override Congress and not have all sorts of shit raised. 
"But that doesnt fix the long term issue. If congress doesnt move it off a schedule 1 substance, the problem isnt fixed. "
"Given the growing trend towards decriminalization and legalization in many states, I think hes waiting for the problem to fix itself. Same with gay marriage."
"In one fell swoop, you killed the Obama cant do that argument."
Im curious which article of the Constitution allows the President to nullify a law.
Executive orders arent the end all be all of law making you know. And no he cant just sign an executive order legalizing marijuana. An executive order does not have that authority.
Yeah. No one would call him a dictator. No one.
"&gt;Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order. Thats entirely within his authority. To 100% legalize and regulate, yes, he would need Congress. But dont act as if the President is without any options in regard to marijuana policy. That would be incredibly inaccurate. If you really think its that easy, you shouldnt be posting on r/politics because you dont seem to know anything about politics. TECHNICALLY, he can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance... the same way that TECHNICALLY he could have put every soldier in Iraq on a boat and take them home on his first day in office. TECHNICALLY, he has that authority. In real life however, things are a lot different. Every president is constantly walking a tight-rope, trying to appease their party, appease the rival parties, appease congress, appease the american people, appease his cabinet, appease the judges... It just isnt nearly as easy as reddit makes it seem to just go bam, marijuana is not schedule 1 and it isnt a procedural issue, its political. Obama knows damn well that if he took marijuana off schedule 1 right now, when the nation is still pretty close to polarized on the subject, it could cause a political backlash that could hurt his presidency and hurt the chances of any democrat looking to run this year. Reading reddit every day it can be easy to forget that just about half the country finds your view on marijuana to be completely insane. They may be wrong scientifically speaking, but politics was never about being correct."
"Right but do you understand the backlash he will get for this? mainly from the Republican party? They will vilify him even though it is something that SHOULD BE DONE, they will turn it to say he is attacking American morals, and thus try to block it every chance they can get."
He can also pardon every person currently in jail for a non-violent marijuana charge. It would be awesome if he did that. 
"No he can not. This lie gets repeated time and again on reddit, but the law does not work this way. You can petition, but then it goes into a lengthy review process, and I mean lengthy. Often a decade or more, theres one sitting in review right now. Obama doesnt have a rubber stamp that says reschedule. Its not even his job to review -- [in a multi-agency process.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_cannabis_from_Schedule_I_of_the_Controlled_Substances_Act#Process) Its clearly something congress has made as complicated as possible. "
"&gt; Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order. No. He cant. The FDA can reschedule the drug, with the approval of the DEA. Obama can threaten to fire everyone in both departments if they fail to reschedule it. But then he might as well show up in the House with impeachment resolutions pre-filed."
"Technically he can, but practically he cant because it would make certain powerful people upset. Thats why its called politics."
"&gt;Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order Its strange to me the number of comments which are taking this statement as true by fiat, and responding with reasons why the President would prefer not to do that, rather than demanding that you provide some citation for the authority to override Congress express will on the issue. And before you say the DEA could therefore the President can please remember that delegation of legislative authority to an executive agency is *not* delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch. Ill wait."
"&gt; Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order. Thats entirely within his authority. No, it isnt. Nothing that is part of the convention of psychotropic drugs treaty can be rescheduled. The right of the AG to re-schedule is not universal."

"From the Reddit hivemind, ya, I guess so. Im responding to comments claiming that Obamas 45% Promise Kept rating means that he was lying 65% of the time. Compromise on an issue? Well, that just means that youre a liar. Congress stall your efforts to keep your promise? Well, that also just means that youre a liar."
"Yeah, this list rates Gitmo as stalled, because theres some intangible negotiating going on, allegedly because its no his fault that he cant close it, but Congress. If he would want it closed, he could close it. So much for this list. Edit: Stalled instead of promise kept, which is essentially: Gitmo remains open."

"In regards to the internet though, hes a complete liar. Even in his AMA, which was likely a member of his staff, he claims to support an open internet. Why the hell was he trying to resurrect pieces of SOPA then? He was on board with ACTA too. Congress didnt force him to endorse those proposals. Has Congress been a hindrance for some things? Definitely. Have they been enough of a hindrance to justify using them as a scapegoat for him being a shitty President? No. "
Its Rand Paul now. Ron Paul is so 2012. :)
The Carter administration and the Church Committee. The Obama administration is less press friendly than Ws was and has prosecuted whistleblowers on a rate more than pretty much any other administration. 
"I never said that *all* of his promises would have been kept with a more cooperative Congress, but certainly more of them would have. I only posted the link to dispute the idea (advanced by the person I was responding to) that the list of Obamas kept promises would be short. Its not."
[deleted]
"And [here](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/) is that list. Youll notice that hes kept twice as many promises as hes broken. Its unfortunate that promises have been broken, but given that hes dealing with literally the most [ineffective](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/11/news/la-pn-congress-few-laws-2013-20131211) Congress in the history of the chamber, Im actually amazed that hes been able to accomplish as much as he has. EDIT: And now I have been given Reddit gold for a post where it feels like dissenters of my position outnumber supports 10 to 1. Maybe there is a silent majority out there after all. Well, thank you anonymous sir or madam, whoever you are. I shall go forth with vigor."
Thanks for fighting the good fight Aukla. I dont subscribe to the Obama hate bandwagon. The problem was the tea party movement and republicans in congress.

Sounds like he did exactly what he said eh was going to do. &gt; close Gitmo Obama didnt backpedal on this issue. He wanted to close Gitmo, he tried to close Gitmo, and he would still like to close Gitmo. A backpedal would be if he had changed his mind. He hasnt. Maybe he should have been more specific during his campaign and claimed, I will close Gitmo... as long as Congress lets me. Anyway, Im amazed that Reddit keeps bringing this up like its Obamas fault. Hey Reddit, put more Progressive candidates in office and Gitmo will be closed. &gt; and increase transparency Transparency has been increased, just probably not as much as you would like. Still, I doubt that you can name a more transparent administration and detail why and how they were more transparent."
"Interesting how you dont include compromise, and that list treats all promises as equal in value."
"Its unrealistic and borderline insane to presume that any one person can have the responsibility to govern the worlds most powerful conglomerate of 300+ million people. That being said, as elected president you ARE going to be the primary party held responsible for things. Side: why is there never conversation amongst the people about changing congress. The democratic government is beholden to its people and what is the peoples rating of congress? It can nearly be rounded to 0% approval. "
You keep saying transparent. I do not think it means what you think it means.

Im emailing a list of prisoners, and the place to which each of them is to be transferred/released. This will be done within 30 days or you will be court martialed for insubordination. Done. Any claims that he couldnt close it due to Congress are absolute fucking nonsense."
The Iraq war is over because we were forced out of the country by the new Iraqi leader.... nice spin though
This administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers than any other in history. How is that transparent?
Once again criticizing without providing any real argument or evidence. The echo chamber that you live in is equally old.
"Youre right to point out the reality of the situation, but for a lot of us that initially supported Obama, its not the *number* of promises that have been broken, its *which* promises were broken. Its completely unfair to expect the president to accomplish every single platform promise he comes in on, but when the biggest lines of your campaign are end wars, close Gitmo, and increase transparency, and then you backpedal on every single one of those issues..."
Good guy Obama. Only keeps 2/3 of his promises.
"The problem also seems to be that rather than look at his history and policies and accepting that hes a fairly typical politician with average center-right policies. A guy that has a nice mix of policies to try and satisfy/appeal to the broadest possible range of americans, while still maintaining the status quo and following the bureaucratic processes and politics of congress. Redditors ignored all that and instead took lowest common denominator slogans and marketing hype and constructed this really bizarre and unrealistic character that was going to give everyone free healthcare and create world peace and be a shining beacon of classical liberalism for the entire world, congress be damned, and now theyre disappointed that rainbows do not in fact shine out of Obamas ass and things are business as usual."
All promises not marked as kept are thereby defaulted to not kept.
once again blaming Congress for Obamas issues... this shit is getting old
"http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2013/06/14/columbus-aclu-says-obama-worse-than-bush-on-sivil-liberty-issues.html According to the ACLU and other watchdog organizations, the Obama administration is *less* transparent than the Bush administration, so forgive me if I dont believe some unsourced opinion of a random redditor. "
"Ask for an honest argument, and I get a dishonest reply. Great. &gt; The Carter administration and the Church Committee. The Church committee occurred under Ford, not Carter, and given Fords pardon of Nixon, its hard to defend his transparency. As for Cater, if you want to talk about him being more transparent than Obama, youll have to do better than just writing his name. &gt; The Obama administration is less press friendly than Ws was and has prosecuted whistleblowers on a rate more than pretty much any other administration. So, are you arguing that Obamas administration is less transparent than the notoriously secretive Bush people? I understand that youre only making a singular claim, but its disturbing to me that I ask you to point to a more transparent administration than Obamas, and you cite George W. Bush."
"Hey Reddit, put more Progressive candidates in office and Gitmo will be closed. Yeah thanks to the limber and effective system that brings you the choice of the same liar or Mitt fucking Romney every four years. Power to the people! "
"I appreciate you calling me sir. Still though, this is a link, not an argument, and all the link says is that the government is not being as transparent as reporters would like, but it doesnt compare this administration to past administrations, which would be a useful thing to do since my claim is that transparency has increased under Obama when compared to how it was under, say, Bush."
&gt;he would still like to close Gitmo. He can let everyone out of Gitmo right now with a phone call.
Ah theres the apologists. I almost forgot I was in r/politics until you showed up. 
"Congressional obstruction is not the same as lying. Lying would be if Obama secretly wanted to keep Gitmo open, campaigned on closing it, then revealed his true preference once elected. Obamas opinion and desires on many of these issues havent changed, but the realities of working in a divided government have. Unfortunately, Politifact didnt exist before Obama, so there is no way to chronicle the past promises of presidents and see how Obama compares to them. It will be interesting though to see how the next president compares to him."
"Ya, that happened awhile ago. Where have you been?"
"I appreciate the support in a fight where despite bringing fact and citations to the table, Im outnumbered by raging neckbeards 10 to 1. Its frustrating for sure, but my cross to bear. Honestly, I wish I was a shill, at least then I could look at my paycheck and say that its all been worth it."

"Transparency has been increased Yeah, buy edward snowdens intervention."
"Obama has kept prisoners in Gitmo who have been cleared for release for years, and have no reasonable associate with terrorists, in jail. He has the authority to release them, just as he has the authority to stop drone campaigns in Yemen and Afghanistan, or not kill Americans on targeted assassinations list. The idea that Obama is blocked at EVERY turn and would definitely do what we voted him in for, on the most fundamental issues, is total bullshit. Enough peddling this whitewashing and placing the blame on Republicans all the time. Obama *is* absolutely responsible for policies he has direct, and to some extent even indirect, control over."
Its just incredibly popular to hate Obama on Reddit lately. 
Get out of here with your facts and your research!
I just love how youre making excuses for someone who lied to your face. Youve bought into it so thoroughly defending him is better than admitting you were betrayed and that the person youve put so much faith in is just like the rest it the scumbags in our government.

"Do you not understand how the law works? Congress needs to provide funding to do it, and they have specifically passed a law that says that no funding from the Department of Defense can be used to close Gitmo. Why do you think that if Obama wanted to close Gitmo, he could?"

"&gt;The Iraq war is over, the Afghan war will be ended by the end of the year Maybe Im remembering wrong, but didnt they recently set aside like $70 billion for the war in Afghanistan next year? &gt;Transparency has been increased, just probably not as much as you would like. Still, I doubt that you can name a more transparent administration and detail why and how they were more transparent. Not even a year ago, he lied on Late Night about PRISM right after Snowden started doing his thing. Since when has blatant deception equaled transparency? "
You are actually brave to oppose the circlejerk - have fun with your inbox. :/
"All that hate, and yet not a single cogent argument. I linked you to a source that identifies what Obama has done as president, and you respond by disagreeing with me but not specifying exactly what it is that Im wrong about or why I am wrong. This makes you typical of Reddit, but frustrating for me. Make an argument, or run away, but just spewing nonsense is not really helping anything. "
"We were forced out eh? Ya, that all powerful Iraq leader. Im sure when we saw him Obama said, Holy shit, we have to get out 700 billion dollar a year military out of Iraq before they decimate us! Saying we were forced out of Iraq is about the most dishonest Ive heard in this thread, and if you check my comment history, Im up to my ears in dishonest arguments right now."
"&gt; He wanted to close Gitmo, he tried to close Gitmo Obamas plan to close Gitmo was to simply move the prisoners onto US soil, preserving the system of indefinite detention without trial. It would have gotten rid of the one-word reminder, but not the objectionable policies themselves. The Obama administration has actually made it harder for prisoners to challenge their detention."
"&gt; Youll notice that hes kept twice as many promises as hes broken. You say that like its a good thing. Hey man, he only lies 33% of the time. "
Iraq war is over?
That list has Obama keeping his promise to support net neutrality: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/510/support-network-neutrality-on-the-internet/ http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-kept/?page=12 
Since when is keeping 45% of promises a point of pride? Jesus Christ.
"Oh Christ, this gain? Dont you morons get tired of having this dumb link, which refuses to die, rebutted over and over again? I tell you what, Im not going to go through the whole thing because thats been done in other threads, but I will rebut the first five items, just to show how stupid this is: &gt; On December 31, 2011, Obama signed the NDAA (http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text), giving him the ability to indefinitely detain any U.S. civilian without charge or trial. And he just as quickly said that hes not going to indefinitely detain any U.S. civilian, and in fact hasnt indefinitely detained any U.S. civilian. And based on a series of Supreme Court cases during the Bush administration (Hamdi, Hamdan, and Boumediene), any attempt that he might make to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens would be stuck down by the court. &gt; Obama supports internet censorship/surveillance. He plans to issue an executive order this year that resembles CISPA if the bill is not passed. (http://rt.com/usa/news/white-house-cispa-order-821/) Oh, look, its been a year and nothing like that has happened. Actually, I wish Obama would try to censor morons like you who post factually incorrect garbage on the Internet, just so I dont feel like punching my computer monitor over and over again from having to read this crap. &gt; Despite his claims, Obama has killed thousands of people, including civilians and children, with drone strikes. Obama has never claimed otherwise. Although, its important to note that the drone program is limited to two places (rural Pakistan, and rural Yemen), and that in 2012 and 2013 the proportion of civilian deaths compared to militant deaths was about [2%](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/07/02/resources-and-graphs/). &gt; The president redefined the word ?militant? to mean ?all military-age males in a strike zone?. This allows him to refer to civilians killed in a drone strike as ?militants? to avoid counting civilian deaths. (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;) Its true that this happened, which is why its a good thing that independent journalists (like the ones I cite above) have gone out of their way to calculate the true number of civilians killed compared to militants. That number, again, is about 2% for 2012 and 2013. &gt; President Barack Obama signed the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act of 2012 earlier this year allowing 30,000 drones to be used on U.S. soil by law enforcement, government agencies, corporations, etc. Again, this was a year and do any of you see drones flying over you with missile lock? That aside, if drones do enter the sky, it will likely be so that they can participate in [disaster relief](http://whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/23/drones-the-future-of-disaster-response/), not militant execution (which would be illegal anyway). Anyway, you get the idea. Also, its the height of cowardice to just link to someone elses work without making a point yourself. If youre only point is that Democrats are better liars than Republicans and your only source is an outdated, outlandish, factually incorrect, textwall, then you need to think a little more before posting."
Like Ive been saying for a while. Beware Democrats. All in all theyre more effective liars than Republicans. http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12jaok/obama_gained_almost_an_entire_percentage_point/c6vm8eo?context=3

That was a war unilaterally started by obama. Bush went to congress first. Uh, no, it was an intervention, which is very different than a war, and it had the UNs stamp of approval, so it was most certainly not unilateral. You could not be more wrong."
"Did you actually read the link you posted? If you did, you might have read this: &gt; To take a couple of examples, in 2010, State Department contractor Stephen Kim was indicted for providing information about North Korea to Fox News. Later that year, Jeffrey Sterling, a Central Intelligence Agency officer, was indicted for sharing information with a journalist James Risen about America?s work to counter Iran?s nuclear program. Both defendants have pled not guilty. &gt; There is little suggestion that whatever they might have revealed had to do with any government abuse or that the leakers wanted to raise broad policy concerns. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell School of Law defines a whistleblower as an employee who alleges wrongdoing by his or her employer of the sort that violates public law or tends to injure a considerable number of people. The article goes on to say that, while the claim is technically true, its a murky issue. That aside, its absurd to say that Obama is less transparent than Bush before him, even Clinton, or Reagan. The nature of the presidency requires that secrets be kept. Obama is keeping fewer secrets than his predecessors, but like with so many other things, you not comparing him against them, but instead against an ideal that would actually be worse for the Republic were it to come true."
"&gt;&gt; end wars &gt;The Iraq war is over, the Afghan war will be ended by the end of the year, and no new wars have been started. Sounds like he did exactly what he said eh was going to do.

Bush went to congress first. &gt;&gt; close Gitmo &gt;Obama didnt backpedal on this issue. He wanted to close Gitmo, he tried to close Gitmo, and he would still like to close Gitmo. A backpedal would be if he had changed his mind. He hasnt. Maybe he should have been more specific during his campaign and claimed, I will close Gitmo... as long as Congress lets me. He sure could end indefinite detention. Gitmo is fine, indefinite detention, never fine. They deserve to face a military tribunal be sentenced to death, imprisonment, or be released. &gt;&gt; and increase transparency &gt;Transparency has been increased, just probably not as much as you would like. Still, I doubt that you can name a more transparent administration and detail why and how they were more transparent. Transparency has been increased by Edward Snowden. The obama administration is black book everything. Also obama promised no lobbyists in the whitehouse, so he just meets them across the street. Theyve also refused to allow access to registers that presidents have for years. "
"Saying he ended those wars is disingenuous at best. Its been six years. That isnt ending a war, its finishing a war. Lets not pretend that his original promise was to continue fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan until the war was won, or that a McCain or even possibly a Romney presidency wouldnt have seen the end of the wars on a similar if not identical timetable. Plus Obama tried to start his own war in Syria, and is sounding more and more like he will intervene in Ukraine any day now. And while we are at it, lets address the fact that while Obama may have a shitty congress now, the Democrats had a supermajority for quite a while under Obama, and Gitmo wasnt closed. So clearly putting more progressives in office wont close Gitmo. "
"I guess you dont really know how U.S. law works then, eh? Well, you appear to be an anarchist, so I guess thats to be expected."
"&gt;The Obama administration sought to close [Guantanamo] **only in the most meaningless sense of that word**: by moving its defining injustice -- indefinite, due-process-free detention -- [a few thousand miles north onto U.S. soil](http://www.salon.com/2011/02/04/guantanamo_16/)."
"McCain specifically campaigned on keeping U.S. troops in Iraq for the foreseeable future, so I think its reasonable to believe that if he were elected, U.S. troops would still be there. As for your second comment, the Democrat super-majority was less than one year, and was only a super-majority if you counted Joe Lieberman (an independent) as a Democrat (he didnt often act like one). That aside, its certainly correct that many of those Democrats voted against closing Guantanamo, and they shouldnt have. Those Democrats and Obama have a difference of opinion on the issue, but my point is to say that if youre angry that Guantanamo is still open, you should direct your vitriol at Congress, not Obama. That simple point is lost on many Redditors."

Fucking this. People need to understand that some things are out of the Presidents control.
"Wrong on many accounts. First, Bush signed that agreement just so that he could say that he put into a place a plan to end the war before he left office. But once Obama came in, he wasnt beholden to that plan or any other. Surely you remember that during the 2008 campaign, John McCain was for an extended U.S. military presence in Iraq, right? It was one of the chief points of division between the two candidates. Had McCain won, the U.S. would have stayed in Iraq. He didnt. Second, the U.S. troop presence that would have been extended past the pullout date would have only been one division, and even then would have only been temporary to cover exigencies. Lets not pretend that Obama was going to keep 150,000 troops in Iraq past the pullout date."
I wonder what Obama would have to do to finally lose your blind trust.
And I wonder what I would have to do to get you to make an actual argument as opposed to mindless banter.
"Democrats had complete control on the executive and legislative branch his first two years in office, no? "
"Yes, and the majority of Obamas Kept Promises occurred during that time. His Compromises and Broken Promises have mostly been since the Republicans regained control of the House in January, 2011. Its worth noting, however, that although Democrats had majorities in both chambers for two years, the Republicans were able to filibuster many Democratic initiatives, which prevented Obama from doing things like sign into law an even larger stimulus, a healthcare bill with a public option, or a cap and trade energy plan, among other things."
I dont know if Id consider a compromise not breaking a promise.

Why in the hell was it soooo terrible to point out that 47% of Americans pay no income tax! http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-47-percent-americans-pay-no-income-tax/ NEARLY half the nation pays no income tax...but people seethe at the rich! http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/taxes/story/2011-09-20/buffett-tax-millionaires/50480226/1 &gt;The 10% of households with the highest incomes pay more than half of all federal taxes. They pay more than 70% of federal income taxes, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If you *mention* these things... liberals seem to get their noses all out of joint... but they are FACTS. Some people need their reality checked. "
"What a sad view of humanity you have. If the 1% dont wave a carrot in front of our face, well all just revert back to the useless lazy slobs we really are! We NEED the ultra rich. We NEED poverty. How else will those dumb work horses know which end is up? What will we have to strive for if someone doesnt spoon feed us an ideal. How can we feel achievement or mastery without sneering at those digging through the trash for their next meal. How can we live with ourselves."
"Thank you, now join me in taking our lumps for daring to have a different opinion on this subreddit"
"It isnt about NEEDING the ultra rich. It is about not placing a cap on achievement. Do you believe we would have the iPhone if someone had told Steve Jobs or Woz (You have enough, you can t make more money, you have to share with all your workers instead). No. Great accomplishments are made by great people, and those people deserve to make as much as they can, and yes, their family and offspring deserve to benefit from what their fathers did before them. Or. Do you think that children should be taken away from their parents and raised by the government. So that everyone starts in exactly the same circumstances and everyone can be equal? Do you believe that children shouldnt be allowed to inherit? And who are you to decide how much? The best deserve the best, the most we can do for the poor is to make sure that they can achieve whatever they are willing to work for. By taking away the rewards for achievement, you are taking away the incentive to achieve. we dont need rich to tell us how to live, and we dont need poor as an example of what not to be. We need to let people achieve what they have the potential to achieve. Stop bitching about people with lots of money, and instead address the real reasons behind poverty. hint: people are not poor because other people are rich."
"What you seem to be over looking its that those services require a tax base to operate, and the tax base is collapsing in California cities like San Bernardino and Stockton where they have declared bankruptcy due to the tax burden of those very services you cite. You cant keep paying the cops and firemen when the majority of the cities population is on welfare and not contributing to the tax base. I see fact check conveniently left those facts out of their lengthy analysis."
If the future is so rosy then why are we on the list of death spiralstates where those on government aid outnumber those who are employed?

No. You are believing something false because you hear it from a preferable source.

Please post a link from a credible source that backs that up. I see nothing in the news about that deal falling apart.

Please stop accusing me of spreading lies without any credible information to refute my statement.
Isnt the overall message more important than nitpicking statistics? 
"Has the Obama White House ever addressed the fact that they pay women, on average, 18% less than men?"
"Well to be fair, he just made it up. He wasnt speaking factually at the time."
I used to like his dad. But that was when his ideas sounded fresh and new. Now he sounds like a rambling old man stuck on the past. His son on the other hand is a nut that gets no false credibility because of who his dad was
"While I do believe this to be a little nitpicky, lets not forget that this is the same individual whose office was responsible for scores of plagiarised material not too long back. Since the interns responsible for researching the facts that hes using have a less than sterling record; I believe its entirely fair to pull out the fine tooth comb here. He could have easily been more general (about half, in-demand fields, etc.) but he chose to be more precise than necessary. "
"His point is accurate, if the specific example is not. Generally women are getting advanced degrees more often then men."
Even if it were true? So what?
"So rather than being more than half of those particular disciplines they are oh so slightly less than half while being well more than half of other disciplines. Boy howdy, he could not be more wrong could he?"
"Thats it! This man, Rand Paul, is NOT FIT to be President of these United States. But then there is Obama and his Obamacare claims: **PolitiFact ruling on Obama and Obamacare claims:** According to Obama, What we said was you can keep (your plan) if it hasn?t changed since the law passed. But we found at least 37 times since Obama?s inauguration where he or a top administration official made a variation of the pledge that if you like your plan, you can keep it, and we never found an instance in which he offered the caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn?t changed after the law?s passage. And seven of those 37 cases came after the release of the HHS regulations that defined the grandfathering process, when the impact would be clear. While Sebelius? teleconference with reporters did provide that sort of caveat, in other instances, such as her blog post, she focused on the upside, not the downside. Her one mention of the extent to which grandfathered plans might be doomed strikes us as the equivalent of the fine print on a television commercial running in heavy rotation. Obama is ignoring the overwhelming majority of times he addressed the issue, where most people would have heard it. **We rate his claim Pants on Fire.** Which lie do you think affects the Americans in a bad way the most? So if Rand Paul is a lair, what is Obama? "
I think his point was that women are a growing majority of post-grads just as they have overtaking undergrad. This isnt really something worth party bias bickering. 
"The article says women still make up more than 45% of medical, dental, and law students. He could have said, Almost half and he would have been alright."

And thats why you dont trust Wikipedia. 
But in fact more than 50 percent are total idiots and/or pricks
"Oh please- The false verdict is the result of PoliFacts unwillingness to give leeway in this case, even though the essence of what Sen. Paul said is true. Here is a list of all the times President Obama was wrong, but PoliFact felt the need to grant him this leeway. http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/statements/byruling/mostly-true/ "
"Politifact, and everyone else, could really just save time by saying Rand Paul says and end with lies."
Ill be voting for Rand Paul in 2016. 
PolitiFact are mostly FALSE. They really are just utter wankers whether you happen to agree with them on the day or not.
"You know what? &gt;Let?s start with medicine. In 2013, 83,472 individuals were enrolled in medical schools across the United States, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. About 38,950 were women, or 46.7 percent. &gt;Now let?s move on to dental school... According to an American Dental Association education survey, there were 11,613 men in dental schools in 2010-11, and 10,240 women, or about 46.9 percent of enrollees. &gt;In law school... According to the American Bar Association, there were 146,288 people enrolled in a juris doctorate program in 2011-12 and 68,262, or 46.7 percent, were women. &gt;For the record, there are three fields that require specific advanced degrees where women do outnumber men. Of the degrees earned in optometry and pharmacy in 2012, two-thirds went to women, and about 78 percent of veterinary degrees went to females. In the others ? dentistry, medicine, osteopathic medicine, podiatry, chiropractic, law and theology ? men were the majority. Im not a fan of Senator Paul, but I would have accepted him saying about half instead of over half. But, with the numbers so close, I dont see how drawing attention to this is useful. Didnt he just introduce a bill to penalize women for having more than four kids? edit: formatting "
Why is this even relevant? Who cares if he was a little off on the numbers? If you disagree with his ideology and dont like his principles then address that..not some insignificant off hand remark that should be one of the last things we are worried about. This is pathetic OP. Edit: address 
"By 2000, the percentages had flipped, with women holding 58 percent of post-bachelor?s degrees among the same demographic, according to the U.S. Census. The breakdown remained similar in 2009. That is fucked up right there. Correlation evidence that we are punishing young boys/men for problems of other generations."
He counted?
Rand Paul is a drooling idiot -- TRUE.
"That was a lot of words to prove the statement false. Couldnt they just say, Rand Paul was talking! Ruling: False! Besides, in Rand Paul land this is probably as close as it gets to true. "

So they have gone from BENGHAZI BENGHAZI BENGHAZI to this... I guess Benghazi wasnt that big of a deal after all.
The Republican party IS desperate and out of control. 
"To use a well-worn GOP talking point*, Stop bringing up the past! ^*Only ^when ^its ^convenient"
"This headline is from 1998, right?"
"GOP: &gt; Weve got nothing, so were rehashing dirt from 16 years ago. Whats up with GOP and living in the past?"
"Dear Republican Party, Please dont listen to a thing that the National Journal says. Please let Americans know that Republicans think the best approach to beating Americas first woman to be a presidential nominee will be to endlessly point out that she was a victim of marital infidelity. We think that is an excellent approach that will resonate with the American public in general and American women specifically. Keep up the good work. Sincerely, The Democrats."
But the Republican Party **IS** desperate and out of control
Dont forget about Whitewater. 
"The GOP also looks really *old* when they bring that up. the next generation of voters, the ones that are the most likely to not have a team, dont know Lewinsky, and they dont care. To them, Bill Clinton *is a historical figure*, and one that presided over what was for a lot of them a pretty cool childhood. Lewinsky is a *nobody* in their eyes. The GOP bringing this up would be like trying to court me by talking about how Gerald Ford was such a goofball. Before my time, dont care, and dont see why its relevant to *now*."
"Honestly, there have to be some smart Republicans. So why arent any of them allowed to say, Hey, this is a dumb fucking idea. I mean, stuff like this is why theyre losing the country."
"Something something *Newt Gingrich*, something, *third mistress as the second dies of cancer*, something something *snorting coke off gay prostitutes*, something something *wide stance* something"
Yup. What they are actually saying is the best argument we have against Hilary Clinton is something dumb her husband did 20 years ago.
What Year is it?!
"And yet, women are made out to be incompetent to be in their own bodies by the republican party. "
"&gt; One of the workplace laws and rules that I think are good is that bosses shouldn?t prey on young interns in their office. Being preyed on means being a victim or pressured. As far as I can tell, Monica Lewinsky was a willing participant. While having sex with your intern has the potential for abuse, it doesnt seem to have happened here. It is frowned upon because of the potential for abuse. If no abuse happened, then you have no case for calling the behavior predatory. Inappropriate yes, but since it turned out to be consensual it was arguably not abuse."
"It makes them look desperate and out of control because they are. Thats why theyre doing it. Just like if I set myself on fire, it will make me look like Im self immolating. Because I am. Welcome to 2008."
"Im more conservative-leaning myself (capitalist), and making arguments about a persons private life that is not related to any issues just shows how weak attacking position is. It happened over a decade ago, people."
"Makes them look nearly a century out of date, blaming the wife for the husbands infidelity. That should tie up the womens vote for them."
Alternately... instead of pretending not to be desperate and out of control they could stop being desperate and out of control? Might be asking too much?
republicans have looked that way since Bush
"right, we have NAFTA and the repealing of Glass-Steagall to be upset over."
"... Out of control, and a junior high school girl."
Look?? They ARE desperate and out of control..... 
"It looks out of touch, too. Who cares? Besides, last I checked, almost every major politician has some crazy background story with exes or mistresses or seventeen wives or as sexting addiction- maybe we can set side what men and women do with thier bodies off the clock and focus on the job they do or dont do? Maybe instead of yelling generalities about who is or isnt out of control - and what side of the stupid aisle theyre on or what little letter is beside their name- we can focus on their policy and the ways they are or arent voting? The legislation they are or arent introducing? Give me less about whats between or not between their legs and more about whats between their ears, please. Im SO READY for civil discourse. Republicans- leave sex alone! Democrats- leave Republicans not leaving sex alone, alone! Media- leave everyones personal fucking lives! Alone! American people!

"Hey. At least Clinton takes a PERSONAL interest in vaginas. The GOP talks policy thet equates them with, oh, I dont know, like, Canola or something. Give me a huge fucking break. GOP == SOCIALLY RETARDED "
"The conservative/Republican bubble is so tight, they fail to see how it was their actions, that revolted the nation, far more than Lewinsky."
Maybe it makes the Republican Party look desperate and out of control because it *is* desperate and out of control.
AM talk radio has been talking about how being a successful woman these days puts you at a higher risk for lesbianism. You can tell they know they are going to get their asses handed to them by Hillary and they are just starting early at their attempt to remind women that they belong in the kitchen.
 Bill Clinton showed real power in helping Obama. He was able to convey messages in a fashion that the people could understand. It is that power that Pauly wants to defuse. Hillary has a real asset in Bill. The Repubs have to knee cap him before Hillary runs. So Pauly is starting it out now. They may have to get Ken Starr to start another inquisition. 
"Republicans...you have to wait until *after* Hillary is elected before you attempt to impeach her. This party, man...it makes kindergarten look like Swedish parliament its so inefficient and pointless."
"It exemplifies how out of touch that party is. I mean really, Lewinski was a valid talking point 15 years ago. Now its just desperation. "
"You can practically smell the FLOP SWEAT on the GOPs collective brow. They know theyre gonna get their asses kicked, but cant seem to avoid it without pissing off some segment of their base."
Right because binders full of women and Romney tied his dog to the roof of his car! were such solid talking points....
"If this is so absurd, why are we even discussing it? Just fucking stop. Please!"
"&gt;Though Paul said that Hillary Clinton shouldn?t be judged for her husband?s behavior, he suggested the Lewinsky affair would be a factor if she sought the presidency in two years. ?Sometimes it?s hard to separate one from the other,? Paul said of the Clintons. No, thats YOUR interpretation of Rand Pauls words. He never said, Well definitely bring up the Lewinsky affair if Hillary runs. You are putting words in his mouth and reporting them as fact. &gt;Here?s the problem: While Clinton bashing may be a good pre-primary tactic, it?s a lousy politics for the Republican Party in general. We know that because Clinton registered the highest approval ratings of his presidency during the period between the January 1998 exposure of his affair and February 1999, when the Senate voted to acquit him. Christ. Dont remind me of the time the American people gave Clinton his highest approval ratings after he cheated on his wife and lied about it. "
The GOP *isnt* desperate and out of control?
[Any one ever seen anything about Mezvinsky in the news](http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/mezvinsky.asp)

As opposed to the fact that they ARE desperate and out of control?
Political gamesmanship 101: Seek out vulnerabilities and pounce. Bill Clinton has been (and for some will continue to be) a lightning rod for criticism in regards to his sexual proclivities and history. Reminding voters that electing Hilary will have Billy Blowjob prowling the corridors of the White House again can only cost her votes among traditional values undecided voters. I expect well hear I did not have sexual relations with that Woman over and over for Months. 
9 out of 10 times ive seen this brought up in the media is liberals saying how the GOP is dumb for bringing it up. The horse has been dead for a while..
The Republican Party is desperate and out of control. If the shoe fits.

"Hilary has too much baggage, I really wish democrats would pick a decent candidate with no real history. "
"Lewinksy shouldnt be a talking point because that was over a decade ago. Oh wait, are we all on board for Hillary or something? You know, Id like another president whose surname isnt Bush or Clinton. Thatd be great. I also think that Hillary would be Americas Gloria Arrayo."

"Sorry, but no matter how hard the left tries to explain this away, they cant... It is what it is.. wrong. And leads to a bigger question, with Democrat Party members that could draw Indys like me out there, why support someone so flawed? http://freebeacon.com/the-hillary-papers/ THE SEX FILES On July 28, 1997, President Clinton was facing yet another wave of allegations from yet another woman. Kathleen Willey had accused Clinton of sexually assaulting her, and Blair faxed a Drudge Report item about her claims to one of the president?s aides. Blair?s handwritten note attached to the story: ?Do we take Matt Drudge seriously?? Six months later, Drudge would break the story of an affair between Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky, setting in motion the events that would lead to the president?s impeachment. Hillary Rodham Clinton When Clinton finally admitted to the relationship after repeated denials, Hillary Clinton defended her husband in a phone call with Blair. She said her husband had made a mistake by fooling around with the ?narcissistic loony toon? Lewinsky, but was driven to it in part by his political adversaries, the loneliness of the presidency, and her own failures as a wife. She told Blair that the affair did not include sex ?within any real meaning? of the term and noted President Clinton ?tried to manage? Monica after they broke up but things spiraled ?beyond control.? Blair described the contents of the Sept. 9, 1998, phone call in a journal entry. ?[Hillary] is not trying to excuse [Bill Clinton]; it was a huge personal lapse. And she is not taking responsibility for it,? Blair wrote. ?But, she does say this to put his actions in context. Ever since he took office they?ve been going thru personal tragedy ([the death of] Vince [Foster], her dad, his mom) and immediately all the ugly forces started making up hateful things about them, pounding on them.? ?They adopted strategy, public strategy, of acting as tho it didn?t bother them; had to. [Hillary] didn?t realize toll it was taking on him,? Blair continued. ?She thinks she was not smart enough, not sensitive enough, not free enough of her own concerns and struggles to realize the price he was paying.? Hillary Clinton told Blair she had received ?a letter from a psychologist who does family therapy and sexual infidelity problems,? who told the Yale Law School graduate, ?most men with fidelity problems [were] raised by two women and felt conflicted between them.? The psychologist suggested that Bill?s infidelity had its roots in his childhood. ?He?d read about Bill?s bio; grandmother despised [Bill?s mother] Virginia, tried to get custody of Bill; Bill adored by his mother, but she left him, etc. etc.? In her conversations with Blair, the first lady gave her husband credit for trying to end the affair with Lewinsky, and said he did not take advantage of his White House intern. ?It was a lapse, but she says to his credit he tried to break it off, tried to pull away, tried to manage someone who was clearly a ?narcissistic loony toon?; but it was beyond control,? wrote Blair. ?HRC insists, no matter what people say, it was gross inappropriate behavior but it was consensual (was not a power relationship) and was not sex within any real meaning (standup, liedown, oral, etc.) of the term.? ALL THOSE WHINEY WOMEN Hillary Clinton?s blunt assessments were not confined to Monica Lewinsky. In a Dec. 3, 1993, diary entry, Blair recounted a conversation with the first lady about ?Packwood??a reference to then-Sen. Bob Packwood, an influential Republican on health care embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal. ?HC tired of all those whiney women, and she needs him on health care,? wrote Blair. ?I told her I?d been bonding w. creeps; she said that was the story of her whole past year. Fabio incident?sweeping her up, sending her roses.? Privately, the Clinton White House was acutely sensitive to public perceptions of President Clinton?s treatment of women. Supreme Court nominations were not immune from such considerations. In a three-page May 11, 1994, memo, Blair recounted her phone conversation with President Clinton about reservations he had about his preferred nominee to the high Court, the late Arkansas Judge Richard Arnold. Noting Clinton allies had ?really been trying to keep the women?s groups in line since Paula Jones filing,? Bill Clinton, according to Blair?s account, was concerned feminist groups ?might blow sky high? if he appointed Arnold to the Supreme Court. Arnold had ruled that the Jaycees club could bar women from full membership?a decision later overturned by the highest court in the land. Hillary Rodham Clinton The president was also concerned about accusations of infidelity in Arnold?s divorce records?allegations the president believed had the potential to reignite scrutiny of his own background. ?Stuff is in the [divorce] record?apparently includes other people?and no matter what Hatch says, this will come out, and will make it sound like the only friends [Bill] has in Arkansas are adulterers,? wrote Blair. ?This thing is so sick, according to [Bill], in a way he wants to stand up to it, but will come out and will be part of the pattern of sleaze.? The president asked Blair to discuss the Arnold nomination with Hillary Clinton, who was dismissive of ?grassroots? women?s groups. ?[Bill] wanted me to talk to [Hillary], so we got plugged in (at one point had 2 White House operators trying to get me),? wrote Blair. ?[Hillary] listened to what I had to say re women; thought those grassroots groups didn?t count for much; it was the DC groups who would be doing damage, and obviously [Hillary] concerned about [the] ?climate? because of the sexual harassment charge.? The Clinton camp found itself dealing with Bill Clinton?s infidelity early on. In a confidential Feb. 16, 1992, memo entitled ?Possible Investigation Needs,? Clinton campaign staff proposed ways to suppress and discredit stories about the then-Arkansas governor?s affairs. Campaign operatives Loretta Lynch and Nancy McFadden wrote the memo, addressed to campaign manager David Wilhelm. The first item on the itinerary discussed ?GF,? a reference to Gennifer Flowers, the actress and adult model who had recently disclosed her 12-year affair with Bill Clinton. ?Exposing GF: completely as a fraud, liar and possible criminal to stop this story and related stories, prevent future non-related stories and expose press inaction and manipulation,? said the memo. In 1998 Bill Clinton admitted he had had a sexual relationship with Flowers. Another item, headlined ?Women,? referred to Elizabeth Ward and Lencola Sullivan, also rumored to have had relationships with Bill. ?Elizabeth Ward ? determine attitude &amp; check out background; Any Reep connections? When does Playboy come out?? One of the documents in the Blair archive is an unsigned note from Bill Clinton, handwritten on the personal letterhead he used in the mid-1970s. The addressee is unknown. A cover page reads: ?Tomorrow is Thursday.? The undated letter is written on the same personal letterhead that Clinton was using in 1976, prior to becoming attorney general of Arkansas. Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton began dating in 1971 and were married on Oct. 11, 1975. ?Yesterday the recurring shakes came over me again and to rid myself of them I decided to go and buy something for you as much to be doing it as to actually wind up with things,? Clinton wrote. He said he recently had bought books, including One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Bread and Wine by Italian anti-Communist Ignazio Silone. ?By the time I could call last night it was too late and I was too spent,? the future founding chairman of the Clinton Global Initiative went on. ?Today is Thursday. I will be at the little place downstairs in the union at 11:30. If you aren?t there, I?ll understand. And if you are, I will.? The fast-food lover and amateur sax player closed by confessing that he had fallen asleep the night before while reading an erotic love poem from the seventeenth century. ?At 3:30 this morning I fell asleep over Andrew Marvell?s To His Coy Mistress,? wrote Clinton. ?It has been a while since I could feel something so sharply across three hundred years.? Attached to the letter is a photo of a young Bill Clinton holding a saxophone, with the note, ?I thought you might get a kick out of this?I was once even younger.? "
Both parties look desperate and out of control when they demean each other. 
"Maybe they should talk about the corrupt Clinton cabal selling presidential pardons for cash to tax-evading criminal billionaires. Nobody cares about Bill Whos Yer Daddy Clinton sexually abusing a 19-year-old intern while he was her boss. Everybody is pretty much fine with Bills degenerate depravity. The real problem is, as a wreck at 70, Mrs. Clinton is much too old and haggard. In addition, Mrs. Clinton is well documented as being at least slightly brain damaged. Will Obamas sycophantic followers in the misty-eyed messiah media be able to create the sincere swoon for this has been like they did for the former Marxist professor?"
Are you guys seriously backing Hillary Clinton as a potential presidential candidate? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH. I mean cool.
I havent seen any GOP bashing on the Lewinsky. The Romney comments where misleading. He responded to the question asking if the Lewinsky scandal would effect Hillarys presidential chances. He also made it pretty clear that the scandal should not play a factor.

Of course, swinging public opinion in favor of World War II somehow seems more altruistic, at least in retrospect, than swinging public opinion in favor of... whatever this is."
"Of course we knew an attack was imminent. Bush had a memo on his desk about it the month before 9/11. It was a massive failure of all of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that the attacks actually happened. We didnt know how or when, but we werent exactly caught with our pants down."
"I think there is, however, a realistic potential that we knew an attack was imminent. And there is a range of responsibility by the US ranging from neglect to willful permission. ~~Ollie North mentioned the threat from OBL years before.~~ Edit! I am totally wrong with this example as my fine fellow redditors have pointed out below. I was trying to make the point that this effort by OBL was not totally out of the blue for those in power in 2001. I had a come-to-jesus moment when I realized that I was naive to early chain emails and believed this. Maybe this was before I found out that you could lie on the internet. What was the first recorded lie on the internet, I wonder?"
No he didnt. http://www.snopes.com/rumors/north.asp
"Ann Coulter isnt news, she isnt a policy maker, she really isnt anything. The things she says are as relevant as a hobos, and less interesting; a hobo might at least say something surprising."
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/16/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-no-doctors-who-went-american-medi/ Ann Coulter: No doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare. Politifact rates this claim Pants on fire 
"The more you listen to Crazy, the more Crazy talks...Stop listening to Crazy"
I will. I went to the University of North Carolina...in America. Fuck you Ann. 
As an American doctor who went to an American medical school... I will be accepting obamacare.... as will the rest of the staff at my office.. as they will be paying us. Im happy my friend used to go to book stores and put chewed gum in the middle of her books.
"Technically, shes right - there is no such insurance company called Obamacare, nor does the ACA provide insurance for anyone. So, in that respect, no doctor at all will be accepting patients with Obamacare. They will be taking patients with private-sector insurance or Medicare, CHAMPVA, TriCare, etc."
 Ann Coulter makes money by saying awful things. She is a troll. We should just ignore her.
Yeah doctors check their religion and their politics at the door? or at least the good ones do.
Im now seeing banners in front of doctors offices locally that are saying obamacare accepted here. Go figure.
SHES DOING AN AMA?? OH GOD.
"Is it just me, or does she have some ridiculously long fingers in that photo?"
"Exactly, Ann. A longstanding concern of US medical doctors of course was that they had to treat too many poor people due to the accessible and reliable health insurances. Where would we go when Obamacare destroys this flawlessly working system? Oh, wait a second..."
"As much as picking on her during the AMA sounds fun, how about instead we stop putting idiots on the front page? Unless she is causing herself physical pain like a skydive wedgie, I dont want to hear anything about her. "
"Why dignify the ravings of this evil clown with any rebuttal? Facts, evidence or even common sense arent valued by her followers."
"It cracks me up when I see simple-minded idiots referring to Obamacare as if it were some kind of government insurance policy. Are they really too stupid to realize that this is your choice of private insurance from Blue Cross, Aetna, HealthNet, Kaiser, etc... just like youve ALWAYS had (only with better coverage now)."
Dont forget to bring this up during her AMA on Monday.
Dont feed the trolls.
"That is the anorexia/bulimia nervosa kicking in. Although it appears that she has the disease somewhat managed as she ages the electrolyte imbalance will present through through violent mood swings and childish temper tantrums, paranoia, arguments that make no sense, etc. "
"What the hell does that even *mean*? Accepting Obamacare, as if its an insurance program you can sign up for? This idea is pervasive, but totally wrong: you cant sign up for Obamacare and get card that says I have Obamacare. Its just *not a thing*."
I rate this as: NO shit Sherlock 
"So let me get this straight. A columnist engages in hyperbole as is the norm in that genre. For some inexplicable reason politifact decides to interpret it as a straight up statement of fact, then determines it is not true. Then everyone in this thread both accepts the supposition that it was a factual statement (not a hyperbolic one) and gets fired up. Is that about right? I mean I guess someone at politifact was in danger of missing a deadline so came up with a totally bogus column, but I do not understand why anyone is taking either her statement or politifacts analysis seriously."
"My boyfriends doctor knew that his insurance didnt cover Abilify. So he gave him 3 sample boxes. Not all doctors go into medicine for the money. I know you republicunts find that hard to believe, but most people have a thing called empathy. You should try it sometime. "
I really wish there was some action that could be taken against these people who spread outright lies about the ACA. The problem is there are too many people who are willing to take this dose of horseshit without even looking it up.
"I am an American doctor that went to an American school and me nor any of my classmates will be accepting Obamacare. Wait. I am not a doctor. Damnit, her douchebaggery is contagious. "
"As a current medical provider, who went to an American school, I WILL be accepting the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare or Romneycare, and so will many many many of my colleagues. "
Why are we paying attention to Ann Coulter?
Shes the partisan asshole that was claiming that all Democrats were traitors during the first Bush administration. Her irresponsibility in making incendiary claims should be brought up every time she opens her mouth. Then she should be shouted off the stage.
Ann is on fire. http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ann-coulter/
"Well given that Obamacare is not an actual insurance plan I guess in a way she is right. Stupid, but right."
Fact checking Ann Coulter is like standing under a horses ass with a teaspoon. 
What goes through the minds of people when they say stupid shit like that? Do they really believe it? Do they think that in this age of lighting fast communication and research that people wont fact check? Or do they rely on the fact that their followers will blindly believe any of the butt pee that spews out of their mouth? 
"Ahh yes - the performance artist known by Ann Coulter has been informed by her publicist that her brand is losing stickiness with her target demographic : bitter old white men with a Frau Helga - She-Wolf Dominatrix of the Third Reich fetish, thereby requiring her to find a public forum which will allow her to spew hyperbole causing liberals to foam at the mouth and conservatives to foam in their pants. She has the routine down rather well, and we do rise to the bait. There are times when I suspect she means what she says but then I sober up..."
"Ignore this, and ignore her. Its the only way to be rid of this."
This post motivated me to google dont feed the trolls. I was [not disappointed](http://d22zlbw5ff7yk5.cloudfront.net/images/stash-1-50e0d0dde0c1c.gif)
"Nobody is On Obamacare. You go on Blue Cross, Aetna, Humana, etc. just like anyone else. How many ACA opponents have a single clue what theyre talking about?"
True of everything that comes out of her mouth. Same goes for Michelle Malkin too.
Ann Coulter is a cunted cunt. 
Everyone should just keep asking her the exact same question. Over and over. Ann Coulter will you submit to a test to determine your true sex? Or something just as obnoxious. 
Its Ann Coulter. Do we really need Politifact to tell us when this woman is full of shit?
"as a nurse and a patient, I have seen many things that validate the need for the AHA, and I have yet to meet a doctor who thinks it is a bad idea. "
"We get it ann, we *all* get it, the president is black."
The best thing you can do regarding this woman is to ignore her like the irrelevant person she should be.
"my mother and her coworkers were forming a hospital specifically to help the people the ACA helps. and guess what, theyre all doctors. now that their plan is kinda down the drain, theyre are founding a non profit instead."
Shes mentally ill and lives in a world of delusion. She should only be pitied. Nothing more.
"That is funny. How does a doctor actually accept Obamacare?? Thats like saying my local Target or Whole Foods wont accept NYSE or Nasdaq because the money I made in those perticular stock makets, is not acceptable tender. Obamacare is not a healthcare provider or HMO, its an exchange for private insurers to compete for peoples business and this bitch knows that full well. So basically what she is saying is that any doctor that went to an American medical school will not accept private insurence. People are stupid and listen to her and Fox News and think Obamacare is a tangible thing. Like you get an Obamacare card and when someone asks who your insurence provider is, you say Obamacare.Shes just trying to confuse and scare very dimwitted and gullible people. "
"Its Ann Coulter... does anyone actually take her seriously? Shes an act, like professional wrestling."
Needs a Maury meme saying Poles indicate that was a lie.
Manthrax spewing shit? Inconceivable!
Who cares what she says? Ann Coulter and Sarah Palin are professional attention whores and they deserve to be ignored.
lets be honest is there anything Ann Coulter says that wouldnt be rated pants on fire?
"Reddit conundrum: Do I up vote for visibility, or downvote because it makes me angry? (Answer?) lurk. "
It should say that the vast majority of American doctors dont want to put up with Obamacare. I have yet to meet a doctor looking forward to reduced pay and increased work and higher costs and overhead.
They just tell Skelator that so they dont have to see her vagina penis.
I hope she gets dick cancer.
Why anyone pays any attention to that lunatic is beyond me. All she does is spew vitriol.
"Well, Ann Coulter definitely wears pants."
Lets get someone whos actually a medical insurance biller working for a doctor to comment. More denials for procedures gogogo!
I disagree with Politifact here. I dont think Ann Coulter is lying - I think she truly believes what she is saying!
How can you tell Ann Coulter is lying? Her bony jaw is moving.
Lol anne coukter isnt even a hack. Shes just a shitty writer with a law degree. It was easier to write and make money off bigots who dont get her hyperbole. In short A cunt with a capital C.
Nothing that comes out of that womans mouth could be called anything other than reeking ejaculate.
"And this news is brought to you right out of Ann Coulters ass. You may be surprised how can that be since her ass is usually occupied with her head. But with that amazingly small brain, she doesnt need a big head and there are always some leaking cracks in between the inner walls of her cheeks and her tiny head."
"Yeah, that is total lets getem riled up so Ill still get paid for TV appearances and I can keep hawking shitty books idiocy."
"Ann Coulter lies about things! In other news, the sky is blue, water is wet. More at 11."
Since when were accurate statements based on truth and fact a method of presenting sound arguement a consideration by conservative commentators? Hyperbolic vitriol tainted with phobia and self proclaimed ignorance is what spews out of her cake hole. 
"I dont think giving people insurance who clearly shouldnt have it is a good idea from a doctors perspective. I would like to treat patients who care about their body, and who I know will take good advice. If youre obese, smoker, or other poor life choice, I think thats wrong."
Get this bitch a broom and she can be a Halloween decoration or maybe fetch her a candy cabin. 
Why is politifact still being referenced? Shit is gayed the fuck up in terms of accuracy. Also Ann Coutler is a mouthy cunt who needs to be fisted.
Ann Coulter isnt a real person.
Ann Coulter is full of shit you say? no shit!
Of course it is. Anybody who would believe that is fucking retarded.
This will not gain you readers Politifact. Whats next? Fact checking Limbaugh to see if Sandra Fluke is a slut? The idiots who buy this nonsense arent reading Politifact. Dont you get it?
No one should listen to her. She speaks to rile up people. Thats all.

Ann Coulter ... Lied?!
That man needs to shut up.
"Well then, Ill look for a European doctor.. even though Ive had health care forever."
"obamacare... just scrap it all america. Start over. Dont try and reform it, its terribly fucking broken. Chuck it out like that wood burning project you did last month and start a new."
[deleted]
Anything Coulter says is just made to be inflammatory and sell books.
Obamacare is a political and economic issue. Medical school has nothing to do with it. 
"the right wing are really shooting themselves in the foot by continually calling it obamacare, because this is a fantastic reelection ticket for Obama amongst the poor."
Uh... finding even one doctor who would accept it refutes her claim.
The original Blond Joke: http://i.imgur.com/bvfc5VO.jpg
i dont hit women or advocate violence but this is one ridiculous smug asshole who deserves a neck-punch.
Approximately what percentage of doctors working in America went to medical school in Canada? What about other countries?
Ann Coulter told a blatant lie?!??! Who wouldve thought!
"MS1 Student Here. Ahem, bring it on! I live to heal and care. "
"Obamacare, or the ACA more appropriately, is not a payer of benefits. How will a doctor ever know the policy was bought through the exchange? Or even, now that its the law governing ALL health care plans, does that mean they will accept NO insurance and only be paid in cash? Sadly, she is smarter than this and actually knows what she is spewing is crap. It actually makes her an even WORSE person than I already expected."
I believe the phrase is Not even wrong.
"ann coulter, so...stupid. mmmmmm. yeah, right there. im so enlightened and shes a science denier....mmmmm more. she wants to eat babies brains and kill cute kittens... yeah, right there, like that.....i am so smart my farts smell like sweet perfume....harder! harder! look at all this karma...i am amazing...oh god, oh god, oh big bang, oh big bang! ohhhhh darwin.....im cumming! ann coulter should be deported to somalia! aaaasaaargh! yes! yes! yes! best circle jerk everrrrr! "
Anne Coulter lied? That cant be true.
"Considering the absolute garbage that comes out of this womans mouth, it is criminal that she has a platform. I would love if she came to do her AMA and absolutely no-one showed up for it."
I honestly think some people believe there will cards handed out with Obamacare written in graffiti font and a picture of Obama with his thumbs up that youll give to your health care provider. 
Politifact isnt that reliable. They hedge a lot.
"HOW THE FUCK can you rate AN OPINION a lie? HOW THE FUCK can you rate A PREDICTION a lie? Shes not stating a fact, shes stating a general opinion. I think that pretty much proves POLITIFACT is full of shit."
"Crunchy on the outside, right wing nutjob on the inside --Liz Lemon"
"In 2001 I called my long time physician about my new insurance. It was blue cross/blue shield of Indiana. My premium was $65 a week. The response was Sorry, thats the big one we wont accept. My point is: Doctors refusing to accept patients insurance has always been an issue in this country. It will not be a new hurdle for patients to overcome. "
"The syphilis symptoms are strong with this one! EDIT: Oh hey, its my cakeday! "
Translation: I have healthcare coverage already and dont want you to have any.
"From what the (mostly liberal) physicians in my family tell me, the ACA/Obamacare creates mounds more of paperwork for doctor limiting patient-doctor interaction further. As one of my cousins told me, theres already a good amount of paperwork that doctors do and its burdensome for doctors despite the relatively high salaries they receive. On the other hand, Obamacare cuts out a lot of unnecessary procedures and gives physicians more control of patient care which my family seems to love. All-in-all out of 8 doctors and 6 dentists in my family, 11 are for the ACA and 3 are against, despite the increased workload. Suck on that Coulter."
"&gt;Is there any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would prevent U.S.-trained doctors from accepting Obamacare patients Leave it to PolitiFact to take her words in the most literal way possible and not simply accept the fact that she is using (to her detriment) too much hyperbole. &gt;There is some evidence that medical practices are wary about taking patients from plans sold on the marketplace. In September, the Medical Group Management Association -- a trade group for medical-practice executives -- surveyed 1,000 physician groups that collectively employ 47,500 doctors. &gt;The survey asked, among other things, Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange? Only 29 percent of respondents gave a definitive yes. So why is this rated Pants on Fire again? All Coulter is guilty of is using hyperbole to make a point thats rooted in some amount of truth. That certainly doesnt warrant a Pants on Fire rating. "
Can we just get a playboy spread of Coulter and be done with it? 
Serious question from someone planning on medical school; how does obamacare effect the profession of medicine? 
"The saddest thing, I think, is that anyone would need a website to tell them that Coulters statement is not true. "
Stop paying attention to this woman.
"Ladies and gents, it will be a shambles. As much as I would like to strangle the bitch, not a thing will be gained. There is no middle ground with her, you like her, or hate her end of story. Those of you who think you will trap her with a good question, you will not. She is convinced she is right regardless and her answers will be the truth as she sees it. "
People still report what this witch says? She brings absolutely nothing to the discussions of American politics. Dont feed the troll. Boycott her AMA!
"if we really want to be smart, nobody shud ask anything on her AMA and make her look like some weirdo whos seeking some serious amount of attention"
So when you look at all the names on the lists that Obama care provides its Americans.... I call bullshit. When you see pages of parikh and Nguyen then they arent Americans. 
Anybody who expects Ann Coulter to tell the truth is as dumb as Ann Coulter.
Why does anyone pay any attention to this female Skeletor?
"reading or discussing the crazy shit ann coulter vomits out of her blowhole is only encouraging her. She needs meds, not fans. Boycott Ann Coulters AMA!"
"Its just plan race-baiting, so that racist white people see a doctor with, say, a turban and are suspicious Coulter is scum"
"Not sure which is worse, Coulters screeching or Politifacts inability or unwillingness to recognize hyperbole. Both come off as partisan shitbags."
"Its a clever dog whistle. Not only does it put down Obamacare, but it throws racism on top of it. "
"Ah, the famous dogwhistle in the wild. Remember kids, the message is that only furners and browns will be using Obamacare. You dont want to consort with ***those people*** do you? What a sad, sad way to go through life, Mr. Coulter. "
"Present medical student in America. Will accept Obamacare. Burn, Coulterpants."
Ann Coulter is a fascist idiot bitch with a superiority complex. I stopped listening to her years ago.
"Excuse me, but Ann who?"
Attention whore says something liberals give her attention ... *sigh* When will they learn?

"Funny, my father is looking forward to it. So thats ONE, Ann."
Ann Coulter never lets the truth stand in the way of a good story!
First question for Ann: cunt?
Oh come on. Ann Coulter? /r/politics dont you have anything better to do than to listen and critique Ann Coulter?
This woman should be put under mandatory observation at the nearest psych ward.
"Please, Ann Coulter is a Conservative the same way Ann Rice is a Vampire. "
"She is literally a troll, she says shit to annoy liberals and they eat it up for some reason. Youre showing your intelligence by even recognizing what she said."
Who cares what she says? One can assume that anything coming from her mouth is BS given her track record.
The sad thing is many people cannot see this for the frankly trite and poorly conceived lie it is.
"Im a doctor. Im in that 40% that is still weighing the options. I dont wholeheartedly disagree with everything in the ACA, but its going to make my life a lot more difficult."
"It is obviously her opinion. Treat it like it blatantly is. Politifact check, my ass."
"Jeez why are those demotards so idiotic! The republican party is right, all these libtarded senators are trying to do is erode all of our rights, especially my right to own a gun, that an obama isnt even from this country, he is a damn muslim loving communist! Damn commie president."
Ann Coulter lying. Color me the pastel grey shade of completely unsurprised. Shes a willing mouthpiece of intentional harm to Americans.
Id call Ann Coulter a cunt but she lacks the warmth and depth of one. 
"Shes a man, baby."
Ann Coulter is one of the most successful trolls of all time. I have a feeling redditors will be lining up to feed her.
http://backinanncoultersasssaddleagain.blogspot.com/
I heard Ann Coulter raped and killed a girl.
"Im surprised she hasnt been arrested for digging up the corpse of William F. Buckley and parading around her house wearing his skin, wanting to transform, serial killer-like, into an erudite intellectual."
Ann Coulter is fucking retarded horse faced cunt.
Shes doing an AMA in a few days. I bet this one goes ballistic.
" Its Colter. Collter=lies. She is playing a role to make money. it seems to work, but I dont think she believes half of what she says. She can not be that stupid. She is like Rush, saying what a specific audience wants to hear. It is lucrative. Throw bombs, the baggers love it."
"Thats a tactic shes been using for years. The further from the truth she is the more criticism she gets, and will use it to increase her creditability with the Republican base. And it works. No one should be talking about this woman, and eventually shell simply disappear."
"Ann is a genuine psychopath, you cant take anything she says seriously, unless youre thinking about ways to protect the people she wants to hurt"
"she forgot to add that Chinese fortune cookie line --- in bed, or maybe in her case in space."
"*Thinly veiled racism to the white courtesy phone. Thinly veiled racism, white courtesy phone.*"
Coulter says a lot of shit. And its always right when she has a new book out. /You should just ignore her like everybody else with any sense
"Im pretty sure that if Ann Coulters lips are moving, shes spewing bullshit"
A doctor wont accept insurance? Since when did doctors stop wanting to make money? 
"Leave him alone, its hard being a transexual in the US."
People care about what that cunt says? 
Ann who?
i think she meant no self respecting dr would accept this socialist trainwreck of an abortion.
Better not tell my American father who went to American schools to be a physician in America.
Arent her pants always on fire?
"aw, poor redditors, you like freedom of speech until it collides with your thoughts and ideals. let the down votes commence"

"Id love to see a list of things Obama has *wanted* to do in his presidency, and what hes actually accomplished."
"Why would *that* make you raise your eyebrows? His family had long since disowned him by that point, and people were calling for their blood. They needed to get out before a mob got to them. Lord knows we saw plenty of muslims and sikhs attacked in the weeks that followed. God help you if you had bin laden in your name. edit: spelling"
"When Condi Rice went on live television and said We never could have imagined an aircraft could be used as a weapon, my bullshit alarm went mental.

That was one of the first things I learned that *really* raised my eyebrows. I hadnt even begun to question the official narrative of that day yet but I can definitely say learning that really didnt sit right with me.

"Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for your comment. &gt;If they were looking to draw a link between two administrations that lied regarding wars, they would be better off looking at Obamas predecessor. Except we are *here* and *now* with Obama, who has continued *and expanded* a lot of the same bullshit from the last administration. I think what sets him apart from Bush in this respect is that Obama *campaigned* on certain fundamental promises, the majority of which he has broken completely. So much has been written about W. Bush and his lies that its approaching becoming well accepted in the history books. Since Obama is still president, his history is still being written, and we need to hold him up to closer scrutiny than ever before. &gt;If they were looking to see why the initiatives Obama pushed for failed, perhaps they should take a look at Congress. Cant we blame both? This article was specifically discussing the failings of the POTUS, *not* Congress. We need to hold them *both* accountable. Im *sick to death* of people blaming Congress to excuse Obama, and vice versa. They have both been corrupted, and only drastic changes can get us out of such a desperate situation. &gt;but instead look seek some attack no matter how poorly grounded in reality. I know this will be an unpopular opinion here, but I *do* think this article is grounded in reality. I disagreed with just about every decision Bush made and I was very vocal about it. I disagree with the *majority* (but not all) of Obamas decisions, and for some reason, if I try to be vocal about my extreme disappointment in the current administration, it always becomes the fault of Republicans or Congress...*anything* to deflect attention away from the fact that the *system itself* seems to be broken. Your points would have more validity in the universe where the two party system hasnt been completely corrupted. This is not that universe. "
"&gt;Except we are *here* and *now* with Obama, who has continued *and expanded* a lot of the same bullshit from the last administration. Weve withdrawn from one war and are in stepping down a second. He did temporarily increase troop numbers in Afghanistan, yet that was at the request of the military after the numbers had been shrunk to the point where there was not a large enough force to maintain its safety, let alone work towards stabilizing the region. Obama campaigned on ending the wars, this he has done. In this regard, there is no connection between LBJ and Obama. &gt;I think what sets him apart from Bush in this respect is that Obama *campaigned* on certain fundamental promises, the majority of which he has broken completely. With only 22% of his promises listed as broken, I find it hard to see where this statement is truthful. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/ &gt;Since Obama is still president, his history is still being written, and we need to hold him up to closer scrutiny than ever before. I agree, but that doesnt include false attacks and comparisons, nor blanking him for the actions of a congress which has been functioning as an obstructionist body the likes never before seen. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;ei=BBonU_o8rKLSAcjPgPgD&amp;url=http://mediamatters.org/research/2013/11/18/media-guide-to-the-nuclear-option-how-republica/196951&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0CEcQFjAG&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZzJ_2en-dbcB3Xs6cML-KXnNlzQ&amp;sig2=i3c-PmJMUWTa1N9frjN5pg &gt;Cant we blame both? This article was specifically discussing the failings of the POTUS, *not* Congress. We can blame both, but only for the actions each has taken. If someone campaigns on a stand, introduces legislation supporting that stand, and publicly works to promote that stand, it is unfair to hold them at fault when a different group refuse to allow discussion or a vote on that stand specifically to minimize the legacy of the first individual. This is the situation that has been occurring for years now. &gt;We need to hold them *both* accountable. Im *sick to death* of people blaming Congress to excuse Obama, and vice versa. Yes, they both need to be held accountable for what they do. Tell me, how many ideas and incentives, supported by the population at large, has Obama killed through use of his power to veto? How many has the house killed through use of the ability to keep a bill from being brought to a vote? &gt;I know this will be an unpopular opinion here, but I *do* think this article is grounded in reality. I stand by my decision to say its not. It makes false comparisons, unsubstantiated claims, and provides no real backing or rationale for its attacks. It is a political attack piece that might sound good to some on the outside, but holds no value or informative analysis. &gt;Your points would have more validity in the universe where the two party system hasnt been completely corrupted. &gt;This is not that universe. It doesnt have to be for my points to hold value, my points just need the backing of facts and logic. If you feel they dont have that, feel free to refute them with substantive arguments, for mere opinion is not of equal value to reality."

Previously high tax rates were hardly enforced. Nobody paid the high taxes of the 50s and 60s due to the many deductions and loopholes that are now gone. The revenue acts of 1969 and 1986 eliminated these loopholes. So people pay more taxes nowadays than they used to.

"You are a fool. Clark county purchase ALL the grazing rights to Gold Ridge in 1998. They did so because they are trying to make it a permanent preserve in exchange for being allowed to develop other land in the county. There are two private grants totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars (from private foundations) to develop the preserve, however all of that is on hold until Bundy removes his cattle. Clark county tried to buy off Bundy by offering to pay his costs for moving the cattle and to pay him for all the improvements he paid for. He refused and offered to pay them for grazing rights. This is where he gets his claim that he tried to pay the county. They want his cattle off. It wasnt his land when it was BLM, its not his land now that the county owns the rights.

No mater what side is right or wrong this event showed us that the BLM is selling land to Reid Holdings LLC but on the Clark County Assessors website there is no price listed. So now a 35 year old poly sci major that spent 8 years as Reids Cheif of staff is the head of a land management agency and is the one who gets to sign off on selling land to his former boss.
Source? Because even Breitbart finds no evidence that Harry Reid is profiting: Despite the obvious partisan gain to be had if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reids son Rory (a failed 2010 Nevada gubernatorial candidate) had somehow been involved in a land grab affecting the Bundy family ranch operation ? the facts just do not pan out as such. http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/nevada.asp#KlUL3w5GhtlfxupO.99
you cant just make shit up
"I had a debate with some stranger at lunch, and he used the WW2 vets thing as evidence that Obama hates veterans and has no moral compass. It was all I could do to remain respectful at this moment. PS. NOBODY in Washington gives a shit about veterans, unless its time for a photo op. "
"Seeing [this]( http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/museum.asp) being circulated on Facebook made me do a bit of searching to see if it was true. Like Ive said before, Im not a fan of Obama, but even I cant believe some shit "
"Believe me, they will be able to with a few commercials and a couple days on TV. The amount of idiocy on Facebook is astounding with Obama is keeping WW2 veterans out of the memorial!"
"That is a completely separate issue, unrelated to what I asked. I had asked for a source to support the claim that the *first* thing Obama promised to do as president was to repeal the Patriot Act. That came as news to me and I could not find anything to support the claim. So I am trying to find out if it is really a fact or just something that was made-up."
"Not sure if this helps, but heres a list of campaign promises kept and broken by Obama: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/"
So he misses both that Obama isnt a socialist AND what socialism actually is. Good job idiot prof!
Author needs to learn the difference between a story and a fable.
I wonder what the department chair or dean of econ/business has to say on this.
"In another fable, a prof ran a pure capitalist class. In each test, the scores of the top 20% were augmented by taking away 60% of the points from the bottom 80%. And the points of the top 1% were then augmented by taking away 40% of the points from everyone else. Finally, the highest score was augmented by taking away 10% of the points from everyone. 80% of the class failed."
Youre right. Hes not a socialst....hes a communist. 
"Mayhap theres truth to this, but the type of capitalism that rewards massive outsourcing, patent trolls, and lawsuits instead of innovation is a similarly broken system."
How stupid. Although no country can exist with out some socialism it doesnt mean we have to go full blown communism like the teacher did.
"Lol, theres no news like fake news (except fake news from more then a year ago)."
"&gt;This Story of a Prof Who Fails His Entire Class to Illustrate Obamas Socialism Has the Left Furious Gee, I wonder why. http://www.snopes.com/college/exam/socialism.asp And *this* is why this piece of shit blog should be banned from r/politics."
Probably because claiming that Obama is a socialist is patently absurd. 
"I am so very, very tired of the economic Right using theory-based arguments about how correct they are. Oh, you cant do that thing that 10 first-world countries have successfully implemented, our *theories* say it will eliminate jobs and be a net negative for the poor! So color me surprised that at the end of this they reveal its just a *story*, a parable made up by the Right to pat themselves on the back about how smart they are. Fuagh."

"He, and his party, initiated the conflict with the passage of Obamacare because Obamacare was a one party law. There was no, as in zero, Republican support or input. No one would realistically expect that in the US system, such a one party law would stand without a fight. Before you say Its the law of the land etc, remember Slavery was also the law of the land. Slavery withstood several Presidential elections, and was OKd by the Supreme Court. Yet, it is now history. So thats the dynamic nature of our system."
My posting was relevant because it provides perspective.
"I could go through your entire list and make very strong cases against each. I wont do that because, based on this list, you are fully indoctrinated and wont believe any of it. Most of the things on your list have been totally discredited, and are simply the rantings of your right wing media overlords. Ill simply address the vacation thing: As of August 2013 Obama had taken less than one third the vacation that Bush did at the same point in his presidency (92 days vs. 367), and Obamas were no more lavish. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/aug/13/who-vacationed-more-bush-or-obama/ "
Found the FOXNews viewer.
All facts which most of us have no interest in. I support Obama merely because hes pretty funny during his speeches and also because he has a sick jump shot and is effective inside the paint. Keep facts out of discussions. ;-) 
"&gt;I could go through your entire list... But you wont because you cant. I wrote about Michelle Obama costing the taxpayers a lot of money. She is not President, so your argument about Bush is invalid. Politifact is a consensus media organization, not the holy grail, so dont expect truth to come from that quarter. Heres a [reality check](http://oregoncatalyst.com/7461-study-finds-significant-pro-democrat-politifact-bias.html) for you."
"tl;dr because irrelevant to the discussion. If you want to complain about Obama, thats your right, but go do it on some relevant thread."
"Whos paying for all that welfare? Go figure, its not free. Obama has more scandal under his admin than almost any other President, and there is little attention paid to them. BUT some random Republican wants to save taxpayers some money and Reddit has a fit. Obama cost the taxpayers over $400,000 because his wife wanted a longer vacation, and at the same time hes doubled the national debt. Your grandchildren will be paying for that and you dont care because - - - well who knows I suppose for partisan reasons. Im just asking for a little perspective here. Other Obama scandals include: - Obama ignores laws he doesnt like, and makes up new ones with executive orders. - fast and furious (accessory to murder) - Obama overthrew an new ally in Libya and handed it to Islamists who have based the new constitution on Sharia Law. - Using the IRS for partisan purposes, the result: Voter Suppression - Obamas half-brother gets and IRS tax free foundation which he then uses to launder money for the Muslim Brotherhood in Africa. - Another Obama half-brother is in business with the Chinese Army. - Purge of the Military (over 200 high ranking officers out) requiring a loyalty oath to the President, not the US Constitution. - Solindra (crony capitalism and a $849,000,000 loss to the taxpayer) - The phony stimulus program that cost billions and created few if any jobs. - shakedown of BP for $4.5 billion - Whered the money go? - Shake down of JP Morgan - Wheres the money now? - Killed Bin Laden, (really fine - just prove it) - Pigford payments? (you probably never heard of that one) - DOJ attorneys who represented Gitmo Terrorists - Obama has abandoned a ravaged Haiti (its out of the papers, you know) - Obamas Army Corps flooded millions of acres of farmland for no good reason, except the farmers happened to be Republicans. - Obama ignored flood ravaged Kentucky, surprise - they voted for Republicans. - 7 out of 10 Chrysler dealerships shut by Obamas forces were owned by Republicans. it just doesnt stop - this isnt about protecting the poor. Wake the fuck up!"
"&gt; The most transparent administration ever His administration has been the most transparent ever. Please tell me which presidential administration has been more transparent and why. &gt; Campaign Obama said we needed to change the laws on weed&gt; He has changed the laws, or at least enforcement of them. In fact, hes even [institutionalizing](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/us/us-issues-marijuana-guidelines-for-banks.html?_r=0) regulation in legal pot markets. I would call that a pretty substantive change. &gt; He pledged to help whistleblowers His record with whistleblowers is [mixed](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/426/increase-protections-for-whistleblowers/) at worst. Quoting from the link, All the experts we have talked to were more than eager to acknowledge that Obama has done more to protect whistleblowers than any other president before him. But national security whistleblowers represent a glaring exception. The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than any president before. &gt; He didnt like warrantless wiretaps And he still doesnt. The program that youre referring to died in 2007. I think what youre trying to argue is the NSA spying scandal, but thats a different animal. Of course, in making all these (false) claims, youre ignoring all of Obamas achievements as president, of which there have been plenty. But please, continue advancing this false narrative because - despite all evidence to the contrary - it fits your misguided world world. I guess cynicism makes for an easier reality than reality."
No. He attempted that. The most transparent administration ever Campaign Obama said we needed to change the laws on weed He pledged to help whistleblowers He didnt like warrantless wiretaps Plenty more
"The both parties are the same argument is generally a pro-right wing argument, meant to disenchant left-wing supporters or justify being a right-of-center Republican or libertarian who ends up voting GOP. Thats why you only see it on websites that lean left, like reddit. On right wing websites theyre too busy arguing what heinous crime against humanity they think Obama will commit next to bother talking about how voting for him wouldnt be any different from voting for his opponent."
"No the both parties are the same argument is just that - an argument stating that both parties agree on many critical issues left out of the public frame. Issues such as foreign policy (middle eastern interventionism, Israel), monetary policy, economic policy (corporate bailouts), War on Terror and civil liberties (bipartisan support of NSA surveillance, police state), maybe even healthcare. Dont forget Romney developed Romneycare, which is what Obamacare [is based off of](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/mar/20/romneycare-and-obamacare-can-you-tell-difference/). So IMO, we would have had new healthcare regardless of who you voted for in 08. Both the left and the right dont like prosecuting their wall street friends. Obviously, the right works for wall street, but it was Obamas DOJ that refused to prosecute any high-level executive for mortgage fraud, instead deciding on a slap on the wrist in the form of fines. Sure there are differences - IE where people stand on the culture war which ultimately has little bearing on our country. Gay marriage being legal, the ten commandments in a courthouse, none of that has nearly as much bearing as, say, monetary policy and foreign policy, yet we seem to spend an inordinate amount of time focusing and arguing about social and moral issues rather than the concrete. Thats the playground that the politicians have built for the unwashed masses to play in. As long as we spend time getting into arguments that have no clear (or pertinent) answers, the plutocrats and their lobbyists will steer government via covet means and bribery. Its also becoming increasingly hard to talk about those critical issues as even reddit and r/politics mods seem to want to frame the agenda themselves, particularly away from foreign politics labeling it instead world politics, choosing to work from the particularly naive standpoint that American intelligence agencies dont have their fingers in almost every country and around every administration.

"I believe you, but I would be comforted by citations."
Okay. [PolitiFact seems to have an overview of the bill.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/71/allow-imported-prescription-drugs/) Their response does have more articles of course.
"And the problem is, they are getting bullshit information from all over the place. Instead of everyone working together to make the ACA work, we have a minority trying to kill it by misinformation."
"&gt;This lie has been repeated often, but many people had very good plans that were cancelled, and ended up signing up for plans with higher out of pocket costs that were more expensive under ACA Were they comparable plans or did they decide to get the really good plans? Source please? &gt; ACA required the health insurers to provide consumers with an ACA-compliant alternative. And are they cost regulated? Are they also told they could use an ACA state or federal website to find a comparable plan? Would love to see where these are hidden within the cancellation letters. Have a copy to share? And read your Politifact link (Which insidentally, politifact is proven wrong time after time) if you read it carefully enough, you will see where they say The president said this but told us he said that then go on to back up the administrations claims in the very next paragraph. Politifact is pretty good at outting themselves...."
People that list their insurance due to Obamacare amounted to less than 0.5% of the US population. 
I just had a friend on FB complain about how She got a letter from her insurance co that said it was canceling her plan. She called up her insurance broker and finds out a similar plan is more expensive. Cue all the anti-ACA replies. So I ask if she checked out the state exchange. She says she doesnt qualify....I tell her everyone can use plan but she may not qualify for any subsidies. Low and behold she goes on the exchange and finds a comparable plan for the same cost! Its amazing that people wont educate themselves on things that directly affect them and their wallets. 
"Youre wasting your time. Its not that they dont understand everything youre saying, its that they dont give a fuck."
"&gt; People who couldnt keep their insurance had shit plans that the ACA gets rid of. These plans are basically no plan at all. This lie has been repeated often, but many people had very good plans that were cancelled, and ended up signing up for plans with higher out of pocket costs that were more expensive under ACA. &gt;When the insurance companies started canceling these plans, had they pointed users to the Healthcare.gov site instead of selling them their own trumped up plans, most of these people would have seen they can get real insurance cheaper.

This way we dont end up with misconceptions and posts like this. The truth is that the President lied: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-what-hed-said-was-you-could-keep/"
Good point
"He lied or he under estimated the insurance companies greed and ruthlessness? People who couldnt keep their insurance had shit plans that the ACA gets rid of. These plans are basically no plan at all. When the insurance companies started canceling these plans, had they pointed users to the Healthcare.gov site instead of selling them their own trumped up plans, most of these people would have seen they can get real insurance cheaper. The problem here is, instead of calling the president a liar, tell the people the truth of what is really going on. This way we dont end up with misconceptions and posts like this. People need to educate themselves instead of only listening to talking points of the Gop"
"No what you are using is Talking Point Memo facts. Basically all of what you said is spin and has been rejected by even typically Democrat friendly news sources. The only place that I have found that do not accept that the plans being canceled were due to regulatory choices made after the ACA was passed exist here on Reddit and on Thinkprogress, DailyKos, etc. No one believes it. Also saying Source: Facts, isnt convincing at all. http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/28/21213547-obama-admin-knew-millions-could-not-keep-their-health-insurance http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/30/obamas-pledge-that-no-one-will-take-away-your-health-plan/ http://www.factcheck.org/2013/11/keeping-your-health-plan/ Partisanship is like religion."
"What he didnt count on was the fact that insurance companies would try and up-sell you instead of telling you the truth. Had the insurance companies not been scumbags, here is what their emails or cancellation letters would have looked like... Hey, Good news. The ACA says the so called health insurance you now have, isnt really health insurance at all. And, we agree. Sorry for taking advantage of you all of this time and making you pay for a plan that didnt cover anything until you reached your $100,000 per year deductible. And, a plan we would have kicked you off of anyway had you reached your deductible, and we had to start actually paying towards your bills. So, since your plan is now illegal because it was basically fraud, why dont you head on over to healthcare.gov and get a real plan which will more than likely be cheaper than the POS you were paying us for Source: FACTS! Not GOP taking points! "
"So can someone tell me what Gattaca has to do with statism or tryanny or whatever? Is it Obamacare hes comparing it to? I love that movie, just wondering what its doing begin discussed in the House."
Are we really doing this? Can we find nothing better to complain about politics right now? A fucking movie summary?
"Same thing with Stand and Deliver, by the way. Same word for word quotation from the Wikipedia page. Lies and plagiarism no longer matter, as they did in [Joe Bidens day](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2008/08/the_write_stuff.html)."
who gives a shit?
"This is reaching. Like or hate Rand, this is one of the dumbest things to attack someone on. All politicians repeat what their writers give them. Who cares. "
"Who gives a fuck. Rand Paul said that Gattaca provides a cautionary tale for what could happen, and then used lines in the Wikipedia article for the movie when explaining its plot. This is a failure on his speech writers part, but on the whole, is a total non-issue, being drummed up for political reasons."
"Just a healthy reminder that even Rands recent push for a new [Constitutional Amendment](http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=1011) just so happens to be damn near word-for-word from a [2010 chain letter](http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/28thamendment.asp) circulating the right wing email spam. [Heres the breakdown!](http://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughPaulSpam/comments/1phvhy/you_know_rands_amendment_proposal_it_is_based_off/) This is likely even worse plagiarism given hes passing the idea off as his own, and you certainly wouldnt find any citations given by him. This guy would fail a simple TurnItIn submission!"
"Um, do any politicians write their own speeches any more?"
"It would tickle me to no end if Rand Paul actually wrote the wikipedia article on that movie. I now like to think of Rand Paul taking a day off every once in a while to sit down, watch an underrated or unwatched sci-fi movie and touch up the wikipedia articles on it."
"To all the people trying to trivialize this by saying stuff like examine the substance of the speech instead his blatant, remorseless plagiarism... Hes arguing a slippery slope. Allowing abortions will lead to a Gattaca-esque world where the government determines who lives and dies etc. This is some inception level stupidity. On the surface of it, the plagiarism displays a lazy, dishonest work ethic when it comes to preparation. This will undoubtedly be reflected in his governance (parroting talking points and whatnot). One level deeper, the use of a logical fallacy to fearmonger. Allow abortions and the government will seize your hopes and dreams! Either he knows that this logic is invalid hence becoming nothing more than liar or he doesnt know its invalid, so hes incompetent. One level even deeper and were stuck in ideological limbo. We see how blinded he is by his conservatism. When you really think deeply, its a kind of fanaticism that would accomplish their goals at any cost. I mean to most conservatives, since their mission is noble, the ends justify their means. To most of you who are desperately trying to pivot away from this instead of critically evaluating his lack of integrity, ask yourselves why? Is essentially being lied to (not being told this speech was stolen) to persuade people into doing something or voting a certain way justified in a democracy? Hopefully this will shake you out of your stupor."
isnt he just talking about... a movie...
"Rubio, Paul, Cruz, these men seem so small. What makes them think they can be President of the United States."
"Does anyone here realize that politicians dont write their own material? Most of the time someone else prepares remarks based on their views and guidelines. I cant imagine Paul has time to explore wikipedia for material to copy, but his aides, speechwriters, and interns probably do. This is probably an honest mistake on his part, and a fuck up on his teams part."
I dont actually see anything wrong with him ripping off Wikipedia...whats the scandal?
"The plagiarism bothers me. And his defense (given in an interview with Jorge Ramos of Fusion TV and Univision) is even worse. He really doesnt seem to understand what he did wrong. But theres something else. Hes trying to make a link between Obamacare and eugenics, or between abortion and eugenics. he thinks theyre related and hes trying to warn us about them. Its a stretch, I disagree that theres a real threat of it happening, but at least its a defensible position. But the strange thing is, why is he quoting from a movie? It would be one thing if he spoke about a modern politician. or a best-selling book that promoted such views, or if there was any country in the world that was doing it. Why a movie? If he had described the movie in his own words (or his speechwriters) it would bother me just as much. Doesnt anybody else see this?"
I remember Obama doing something similar with just words speech. Now rand?
"Apart from the plagiarism part, (yes, even that) I dont think Gattacas social commentary is one that Rand Paul would really want to be referencing to help his cause. Where does he get ideas like this?"
The best part is him claiming its not plagiarism because he didnt claim to have written Gattaca. 
"Doesnt matter. Rand Paul could strangle a kitten on live TV and his drones would still insist that just because kitten strangling is bad, its not the governments job to legislate against it, while squeezing in buzz words like freedom, liberty, tyranny, statist, charity, voluntary, and second amendment in there somewhere. "
Who cares? Its a summary of a movie. 
Plot twist: he wrote the Wikipedia entry
Where are all those people that complained about manufactured scandals when it dealt with Obamas misdeeds?
So his speechwriter got lazy. Im not seeing a controversy.
Sadly for Paul there are still some with the ability to read and think. He is nothing more than a political hack trading on his fathers name. Sound familiar?
[What?](http://i.imgur.com/pg4TGl2.png)
"I was at the speech Monday. In context, it just sounded like he was summarizing the movie. Probably should have used different phrasing, but I dont have an issue with it. "
Why the fuck would he be talking about eugenics anyway? 
At least he avoided the Pokemon movie. 
Maybe it will at least encourage more people to watch that awesome film.
"Yes, its true, And this is not the first time. And it will most likely happen again because he doesnt seem intelligent enough to understand the definition of plagiarism. Im sure there is a wiki for that."
"This is really sad for the state of r/politics that this non issue is being discussed as front page material. I might not be a fan of Rand Paul, but this honestly just seems like the reddit circlejerk hivemind upvoting anything that seems funny and puts down republicans regardless of the relevance. I sincerely hope that there isnt a soul out there that goes to r/politics for their news source, since its warped beyond reality"
"In this thread: People that dont understand the difference between quoting a movie and repeating someone elses summary of it. Imagine youre a movie reviewer and you wrote a summary of a movie in your review. Then someone repeated your summary and instead of crediting you, they credited the movie. If you dont understand the difference, please re-read the last paragraph until you do. "
"It is fairly stupid to rip on Rand for something minor like this, but it carries larger undertones than just reciting someone elses thought. This man has no originality and seems less intelligent than anyone in public office should. Im going to feel so bad for Ron Paul when his son is more successful in a presidential election running off terms like haters and quoting drab fiction like Atlas Shrugged and Gataca. This dude is a fucking gym teacher, not a presidential nominee or even a decent senator."
Oh no! He totally better get an F on his midterm paper!
ITT: I meet a lot of people that I hope dont vote!
Am I the only one who doesnt care if a politician steals a movie synopsis off of Wikipedia?

"As much as I want to up vote this for being true, Politifact has proven themselves just too unreliable to be an acceptable arbiter of what is factual.

One plagiarist for another
care to expand on that?
Heres one source http://www.dailypaul.com/304120/rachel-maddow-mocked-rand-paul-for-plagiarism-but-she-s-been-accused-of-it-too
Too bad I give maddow zero credibility after her fake as fuck ama. 
"Havent heard the speech, but its strikes me as irrelevant whether or not its original material. If you want to attack the ideas thats fine, but who cares where the ideas came from, they should be vetted on their own merit regardless of source."
I dont judge the quality of a speech on its originality. In fact we would all be better off if politicians actually listened to good ideas of others more often. 
"Blah, this isnt news. Rand cited the movie and took snippets from Wikipedia..big deal. Especially in a 25 minutes speech where 99.9% of the speech was original. Cherry picker.

I think its more hilarious that he doesnt know what plagiarism means.

Who cares what am effeminate teenage boy with a bad haircut says? 
"Dont link Politifact, especially over something so trivial, it just encourages their delusions of grandeur."
"Just the first attempt at many to slander Paul. &gt; We borrowed the plot lines from Gattaca. It?s a movie, Paul told Fusion. I gave credit to the people who wrote the movie. Seems to end all it all there. Movies have great quotes, why not borrow a few in a speech? Thats kind of smart."
Right now I would rather take a president who reads anything Wiki than our current one who knows nothing until it hits the news.
"Look, I usually subscribe to the liberal way of thinking. But, am I the only one that saw the editing of this piece as something to blatantly smear Paul? Im zooming back from any political thinking here, but if one of his advisers said, This would be great for you to quote!, that he wouldnt bat an eye? I mean, these guys (gals) have to give speeches all the time. It bugs me that news anchors, be it Rachel Maddow or Bill OReilly get to call out sound bites of speeches to promote their own political ideology. I just would like to be a part of a political discourse that didnt involve sensationalism..."
"Im going to go ahead and guess she wouldnt say the same about Joe Biden, who has done pretty much the exact same thing. "
Obama has a team of speech writers and cant function without a teleprompter. Nuff said.
Nobody likes Rand anyways 
"He didnt plagiatize, he quoted and explained what happens in the movie."
"Yeah, and Maddow is one to take seriously... Is anyone surprised that shed take a stupid pot-shot at him? I mean, with both parties being exactly the same, why is anyone surprised that both parties are firing blazing arrows at him?"
"Who is the author?An uncredited synopsis of the movie,which he mentionsGattaca.Tolkien admitted to lifting mythology from other cultures.If he lifted lines from A Christmas Carol, then by all means release the hounds."
Yeah so what? Probably one of the best American politicians to date. What has Bush and Obama done for your country?
"[They also call this half true when its not at all true](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/oct/30/like-health-care-you-can-keep-obama/) Essentially, Politifacts bias has shown. That said, who gives a fuck about this and why are we talking about it? Its not like he claimed to write his own speech"
Heh...I wondered when this was gonna hit reddit...
Rand Paul is the same dude who attached a life begins at conception rider to a veterans benefit bill guys a shithawk

Shame on him for hiring someone who learned wikipedia is the most informative place on the net. Get back to watching Gattaca damnit!"
"Look, so did Martin Luther King Jr., and hes OK."
So what? Its not like he tried to sell it as a book. Rachel Maddow reminds me of all the English teachers which couldnt find something wrong with what I wrote but just wanted to point out I was wrong . . . somehow.

At first I liked the article. Then there was the part where it was claimed that borrowing one sentence is plagiarism. I didnt like it anymore. 
He should have gotten an intern to write it!
This is how I assume it went down. Paul had to give a speech to support this candidate so his speech writers set to work as they are known to do with a list of points that should be covered. They either have a lazy member of the team or a college intern who doesnt give a shit rip some lines from the wiki article. His job was to cover the eugenics talking point and he procrastinated. Nobody checked it out because speeches are rarely plagirized and Rand Paul ends up looking like a moron. 
The creative bankruptcy of his speechwriters doesnt bother me so much as the ridiculous and tired slippery slope argument that womens reproductive rights will lead to eugenics.
"A speechwriter will likely be fired here, but the fault is not on Rand, personally. Was Rands story ripped from Wikipedia, yes. Is it a big deal? No. "
"Who cares? What annoys me is he was using it as a cautionary tale, which is absurd. There is nothing in that movie that needs cautioning against, except perhaps the roadside DNA checks. "
"Maddow just got caught plagiarizing a liberal blogger in a real report. Watch Pauls whole speech, he talks about that he is giving a description of a movie...do you want footnotes in case it is from the back of the DVD case, imdb, or wiki? "
He lifted plot points about the movie from the article. I dont care about that but about the major points he made in his essays. The rest is just backbiting. 
The manufactured outrage in this thread is pathetic... Obama gets a pass for drone strikes and massive spying because he reads words a speech writer wrote yet we are keying in on this bullshit? This is pathetic 
"Rachel Maddow accusing somebody else of plagiarism? Hasnt Maddow also been accused of plagiarism at least once? Oh, wait. If it didnt get fact checked by PolitiFact it doesnt count, right?"
I assume politicians dont actually write their speaches. As in they get their assistants to do it for them.
Must be time for /r/politics to ban the politifact domain..
"To be expected as Paul is from the generation who believe its okay to lie, plagiarize, cheat, and steal to get what you want; its endemic to the entire batch of graduates from about 76 to present day. Big money - they got exactly what they needed and most likely at a tidy price !"
rachel maddow is a sick dike 
"Rachel Maddow is the last person I would get news from. She is similar to Perez Hilton, only she focuses on political persons."
"With quality posts like this making the top page, one must wonder how this fine bastion of political discourse was relegated from its default status? I mean if I did what Rand Paul did on a book report in 4th grade I surely would have gotten an F... This is an unacceptable double standard. Seriously though this is definitely more important than the NSA and the failed Obamacare rollout. Drone on friends."
"Its amazing to me that this is even newsworthy. Only partisan hacks like Maddow/Limbaugh would actually spend their time complaining about how Rand Paul repeated facts verbatim, and the real news of the day is how Barack Obama lied saying, if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it. I think Rand and his father are morons, but to complain about a politician stating truths and how he is being truthful is about as lame as it gets. "
Politifact busted a politicians speech writer for borrowing lines in a few of the hundreds of speeches written. So brave. Thats exactly the type of accountability Im expecting!
"But to be fair, politifact also rated TRUE to Obamas claim that everyone would be able to keep their current health insurance plan. "
Who cares
"More bad journalism... its the same information on IMDB, using terms from the original work of fiction. Which was probably written by the PR for the movie."
"Did Maddow also point out Obamas plagiarism, JFKs or MLK? No? Didnt think so. Please keep drinking the red stuff. also who gives a shit... really?"
I love how the gravity of eugenics is completely lost over Marrows quest to bash someone on the right.
"The U.S. cannot afford another 3rd rate intellect in the White House. Hopefully, people will have learned that from the Bush years."
Itll be nice to see the teleprompterers (essentially just birthers/Obama ragers) defending their hero for this.
"SO WHAT? If the content was something Paul agreed with and he wanted it to be heard...so what? Fuck off Maddow. Go shill for the CFR some more, youre nothing more than a talking head for the establishment."
Re-purpose - reuse - recycle. So what is the problem ? :-)
this is soo not an issue. maddow should focus on actual news items - it isnt like there are not a ton of real social issues out there...
Im not sure why you would quote anything related to Gattaca from that perspective anyways. Ethan Hawkes character was really the bad guy for the entirety of the film. 
"I am not a Paul fan, but is this really something to get worked up about? Sure, a Senator plagiarizing never looks good, but it was plot lines from a movie. If he were outlining some policy initiative and it was ripped off from someone but movie plots? It is describing something that isnt in question. Its embarrassing for him and he shouldve changed it up from the wiki page but its not a big deal."
God I hate Rachel Maddow. All the fucking shit-headed republicans in the world and she picks Rand Paul to bust on.
"OMG. This is serious. Lets all focus on a persons speech having similarities to wikipedia article, and ignore the government spying on everything we do online. Impeach Rand Paul!"
You people are seriously freaking the fuck out because Wikipedia was used in its intended purpose? You people are ridiculous. 
Create fear Perpetuate an illusion of choice Those are the only two rules our politicians follow.
We should invade Iran.
AIPAC is probably lobbying hard to keep the Deal at bay 
"I know Repubs think this anyway, but wouldnt this being a wag the dog moment imply that Obama and his team are the slowest (and dumbest) dog waggers ever? The website started October 1. Its nearly December. If they were going to create a diversion, wouldnt have they done it sooner? On a related note, if you read Richard Clarks book about the search for bin Laden, Clinton was the first Pres to really understand what a threat bin Laden was. I am 95% sure IIRC that Clintons wag the dog bombing was an attempt at taking out bin Laden. Could have saved us from 9/11....and the goddamn TSA. Source: http://www.snopes.com/rumors/clinton.asp Last but not least, to the person who made the comment about stealing the wag the dog line from the movie: I believe the term wag the dog had been around for quite a while and was common among politicos. The movie swiped that term, not the other way around... Edit: added a source for Clinton. Couldnt find one for my assertion on wag the dog. I may be wrong on that one but am leaving it until someone shows me a source that proves it..."
Thats because they are Israels bitches. This deal may legitimately be the best thing Obama has done in his entire time in office.
"Sen. Grahams objection makes sense. While the deal does represent great progress, it is all things that can be reversed if the Iranians really wanted to"
"Congress at historic popularity lows, people actually despising them for being obstructionist, and they continue to double-down on their course of destruction of the US government. /slow clap"
War is good for business.
"LOL did he really use the tired wag the dog line from the clinton era? yep when you have one single project that is having some issues, like obamacare, the president,vice president and his defense sect all have to sit on their asses and wait until the people they paid to fix it are done fixing it. also wag the dog is a reference to a fiction story where a president started a conflict to hide problems in his admin, it makes even less sense to use it when it is about diplomacy, then it did when clinton shot missiles at al quada. and on a similar note, Republicans love to blame dems for things they were actually guilty of. WE know that [bush preasured his homeland security sect to raise terror alerts during the election to help him win. Republican Tom Ridge the homeland sect said so himself.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/20/tom-ridge-i-was-pressured_n_264127.html)"
"I could understand why Republicans are confused. We managed to score a win against another country without declaring war like we did in the Bush years (both of them). Im not much for the whole military industrial complex conspiracy theory, but you really have to wonder why someone would view *not* going to war as a bad thing. "

"I dont understand how anyone on either side can call this a win or lose until they read the details of the agreement AND the six month period is up. Im cautiously optimistic and have a few questions on the supposed daily Iran checks supposedly going to take place, but I am glad to see this moving in the right direction. Bottom line is Iran wasnt going to shut down their current nuclear capabilities unless someone made them by force. This is the logical outcome for years of disregard and poor negotiating."
"Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran. - Sen. McCain, 2007"
"An Iran with nuclear weapons is more acceptable to me than a war against Iran to stop them from getting nuclear weapons. Most Americans agree with me. If they didnt, then Mitt would have won, and the neocons , chickenhawks, and roly-poly rightwing armchair generals would have their stupid war. "
"Amazing. Well, not really, Obama did it, its bad. Cornyn has to keep up appearances. He might just be a victim of the religious right purge in his next primary, he hasnt been aggressively stupid enough. "
The black man did something!
I thought I had to vote on it before I could read it.
So much for politics stopping at the waters edge.
"Warmongering racists say what? Seriously, thats a more respectful reply to the repukes than those assholes deserve."
My problem is the $7 billion dollars in relief going into Iran. Guess whose pocket thats coming from?
"these arent random people, these are congressmen. is it so unthinkable that they had details about the agreement before the news reported it?"
It really has to be unhealthy for someone to be forever stuck in hate-mode. 
Obama could announce a cure for cancer and the republicans would find fault.
"I dont even live in that country and it makes me angry how stupid, wastefull and greedy all of that government is. Like spoiled kids with nukes holding the worlds economy by the balls and ready to anihilate anyone who dosent bleed red white and bigmac."
"I dont see how Obama is going to get congress to lift the sanctions. All the GOP and some fraction of the Dems will, as always, do whatever the Israel lobby wants not to mention the GOP tends to oppose anything Obama does anyway."

Republicans: please just shut the fuck up. Youre a bunch of god damned idiots. Geesh.
"Its completely insufficient. Abandon imperialist policy towards the Middle East completely. Stop supporting/running interference for Israel. Stop propping up the House of Saud and all the Gulf oil sheikdoms. Without going all the way and drastically changoing the underlying regional/imperialist policy, peace with Iran is basically something like *coitus interruptus.* It is just a matter of time before we forget the spanking we got in Iraq, the Neocons make a comeback or something, and the crazies in DC pull the trigger on the next round of Middle East insanity. Treat the root cause. Thats imperialism/policy of control &amp; influence over the Middle East. Signing deals with Iran is worthless, useless, and doesnt solve the underlying problems. The US cant be trusted to follow treaties it signs anyhow. "
All of the reddit amateur foreign policy experts spouting off. 
"Listening to Kerry now and I have to say, for someone like me who came of age during the hostage crisis, and didnt learn the real reasons behind the animosity until years later, this is an amazing and very welcomed first step."
I wonder if the Syria gaffe-turned-deal had an effect on how this deal went down. 
"Of course they are, this deal will do the following, beyond entering the US and Iran into a new age of diplomacy based around respect rather than historic hatred and sparing us all from what would have been the most disastrous conflict in our history since Vietnam: This deal seals President Obamas place in history right along side Ronald Reagan as one of the greatest diplomats in living memory, validates the Obama Doctrine over the Bush Doctrine, and most importantly of all: focuses public attention on Obamas success as a leader rather than on administrative shortcomings with implementing Healthcare.gov. All of this translates to one thing: The Republicans chances in 2014 and 2016 are now even more worse off because the President has a major foreign policy victory under his belt, and theyve got nothing."

hasnt this piece been debunked multiple times already?
"You should check out the numbers being reported, you know do a little research. [Here](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/25/blog-posting/do-71-percent-obama-voters-regret-voting-him-2012-/) is where they get 71%. They asked Obama voters if they would vote for Obama again, 79% said yes they would. 10% said no they wouldnt, and 11% said they werent sure. Of the 10% that said no they wouldnt, only 35 people in the survey, 25 people said they regretted voting for Obama. 25/35=71%. So please actually look what the material rather than just accept some numbers. "
"I like Obama, he is far less liberal then expected, kinda the same as dubya."

"Regardless of whether this story is accurate, alway remember that many of us did not vote FOR Obama. Rather, we voted, given the choices provided, AGAINST the other guy. We really need another party, or parties, instead of a duopoly."
"Bill Kristol has never been right about anything, neither has the Weakly Standard. Hell, they preach free market and have never once made a profit."
This was already debunked and the reporter took back her comment. But of course the conservative media has not made a correction yet. This is the same media that puts a (D) next to a republican senator name when that senator has done something scummy.

Did you even watch what his daughter said in an interview?....
I liked his angle about the issue. Especially when he mentions If you were a judge and we got into a fight who would win the fight? Media spins the livelihood of these people. Makes it all about Right wingers and conservative politics and bc the media is laying in bed with the Govt of course all we see are He hasnt paid his way since X administration and that is used to justify all of this. Sad state of affairs really. 
funny how today this ended up on the [front page](http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/nevada.asp) 
"You really ought to try to figure out what the Republican message IS before you bash it. I know Dems like to think that Republicans want people to die in the street. But to your point - &gt; Americans are actually getting kinder over time, and we all do want to be better, which is why we rally around one-off causes like supporting bombing and kidnap victims with gobs of cash. The response to this has been 100% consistent with R principles, and inconsistent with D principles. Rs believe that its not the governments job to help my neighbor. Its mine. Ds believe that ultimately you as an individual have no personal responsibility to help your neighbor - thats the governments job. Look at [studies/articles](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79888.html) about charitable donations, for example. Dems are charitable with other peoples money. Rs are charitable with their own. One of those things counts as charity, one does not. Which one of these principles reflects a kinder society, where people want to be better? Id argue that one position reflects those beliefs, and one does not. And that your apparent interpretation is quite backward. "
"First, wealthy does not equal Republican - sorry, but its true. As Ive mentioned elsewhere, compare wealth (by county, by state, whatever) to voting patterns. The wealthy vote Democrat. As to the great depression, I agree - Hoover overreacted. And then of course FDR prolonged the depression by destroying any incentive for people to work in the private sector (or work doing anything of substance). Why get a real job when you can get paid more money by the [federal government to move dirt from here to there?](http://www.auduboninstitute.org/visit/zoo/exhibits-and-attractions/monkey-hill)"
"First of all, I question the biases of the MIT research when they open by saying that conventional wisdom is that Rs are wealthy and Ds are not (a quick comparison of per capita incomes in red v blue states will put the kibosh on that conventional wisdom. As far as their denigration of the way the conservative/liberal question was asked in the survey brooks used, I really dont see how asking a question like, ?Thinking politically and socially, how would you describe your own general outlook?as being very conservative, moderately conservative, middle-of-the-road, moderately liberal or very liberal?? could give you skewed results; aside from the fact there arent a whole hell of a lot of people that fall in the economically liberal/socially conservative category (or vice versa), Im somewhat at a loss as to why THIS survey (ie the one that shows the answer the MIT folks dont like) is so clearly the flawed one. Second, its a little ridiculous that they control for religiosity. Thats part of the dynamic. If you control for EVERY SINGLE FACTOR other than R or D, could you come out even? Perhaps. But controlling for every single factor misses the forest for the trees. Why dont we control for whether someone is a conservative or a liberal too? Im sure theres someone somewhere that identifies as a liberal but votes Republican, and theres probably someone that identifies as conservative but votes Dem. Lets base our statements on those two guys. To your comparison of police and healthcare, police do not provide a service to me or you. They perform a direct service to society that provides a direct societal benefit. Healthcare on the other hand requires that you confiscate wealth from the American people to provide services to individuals. Further, and this point is often missed, it ultimately means that you give providers no free market in which to sell their services. To your points about costs, that in large part is due to the already overbearing presence of government in the health insurance market. The third party payer problem eliminates competition on the part of insurers, and eliminates any internalization of cost on the part of the insured. If you and I were responsible for buying our own insurance as a general rule (rather than having our employers say, this is what you get), you better believe wed shop around for rates, coverages, whatever else. Further, coverage mandates drive up costs as well. Theres a reason an individual policy bought on the free market (I bought one a few years ago, back when Barack Obama was an obscure State Senator from Chicago) varied so much from state to state. Without specifying states, I bought at the same time as a friend. We were both young (early 20s). We were both fairly healthy. We both looked at similar/base plans from the same insurer. I paid $120 a month in a solid red state. My friend paid over $400 a month in a solid blue state. In what world is it reasonable to tell a single, 20-something guy that he has to buy insurance that covers abortion, or pregnancy, or substance abuse? Well, my friend in the blue state was covered for all those things. In closing, I really hope you dont believe that government can guarantee those things for anyone either. I assume you watch the news. Did Amanda Berry get guaranteed police treatment? Do the millions of people that (per CBO) will lose their employer provided healthcare as a direct result of Obamacare get guaranteed healthcare treatment? Heres the thing. The government is not effective. Its not efficient. And it cant (and wont) provide total coverage to anyone. I see it every day. Youre naive if you think otherwise. "
"As to the second part, Ill just state that Ive lived in both quite conservative and quite liberal (news flash - the DC area is QUITE liberal) areas. Are people going to flat out admit (or even recognize, potentially) that they dont take any personal responsibility? Of course not. But from observation, people in this (again overwhelmingly) Dem area reflexively rely on the government to help their neighbors. Example - Ive been to neighborhood assn/HOA meetings in multiple communities in this area, and the topic of helping the less fortunate comes up occasionally as you might imagine at a meeting like that. And the go-to source that is always settled on is government. Government run homeless shelter, government run food bank - lets point people to that! In conservative communities I have lived/spent time in, its people are hungry in our neighborhood? Lets start up a community run food bank! Quite simply, people have outsourced any responsibility to their fellow man. Its sad. As to whether communities can meet that need, Id encourage you to read up on the response to Hurricane Katrina (Dems love to bash the federal response; I actually do as well, but unlike Dems I dont think it was anything particular W, Brownie, whoever did - it was an inherent flaw with government). I mean, shit - whos the first on the ground anywhere? Its not FEMA. Its the Red Cross. I spent time in SE LA shortly after the hurricane. People were not getting help from the government - state, federal, or local. They were getting help from charity (generally church organizations, actually, but the Red Cross to some extent too). When FEMA was still trying to pull its head out of its ass and keep ice (that it overpaid for) from melting on loading docks, church groups, RC, etc were trucking in food, trucking in volunteers. Food was available in central locations that were publicized in the community if you could get there, and if you couldnt it was delivered. The number one provider of drinking water? It wasnt the federal government - it was [Anheuser-Busch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canned_water) (they switched several bottling lines from canning beer to canning water; I kept one as a souvenir but it was unfortunately lost in a move). The government finally got its shit together right around the time its help was completely unnecessary. "
"With all due respect, the handful of wealthy Republicans you worked with are not representative of the party as a whole. And I find it pretty amusing that you with a straight face call yourself an independent. I can absolutely assure you that I work with MANY more Republicans, across the spectrum - from high dollar donors, to grassroots folks with no money (but plenty of free time). The need for social services has not changed substantively. Democrats handing out money to people that wouldnt have gotten it from the government (but instead from their Church, or a community social aid organization/etc) in the past has. As far as your insistence that corporations pay taxes, please - tell me how that works. Because when taxes on Walmart, for example, go up, my prices go up. People pay taxes - guess how that tax is paid? My prices go up - sticking it to the lower/middle class, as you so eloquently put it. As for talking about how the evil rich are not paying taxes and the poor do, for fucks sake - get out a tax table and calculate the percentages. If you want taxes to go up on the rich, so be it. But dont pretend that the rich pay a lower proportion of their income than the middle class - its simply inaccurate. As to compliance, Id be all about the tax code being tossed out. A flat rate tax, or a consumption tax, would be great. But if youve paid any attention, the special treatment in the tax code is in large part a creation of the Democrats (remember that the 1986 tax code was written by a Democrat House). "
"the problem is that Rs are charitable with their own is false. Ds definitely do not have a good system figured out, but lauding the Rs as some sort of benevolent givers is horrifyingly inaccurate. this is backup up by historical fact. President Hoover proved this theory was utter and complete bullshit when the majority of America was suffering from the Great Depression. Presidential call-to-arms of the wealthy Americans to help the less fortunate was such an abysmal failure that shanty towns were fucking /named/ after him because of peoples disgust toward his apparent lack of competence. I dont believe Ds have the best answer, but Rs most definitely do not have any sort of acceptable answer, period. Our public has showed time and time again that money &gt; compassion. "
"What do you think churches do with their money? They dont burn it - they spend it in the community. Since youre speaking somewhat condescendingly of church giving, I hope Im not going out on a limb by assuming you rarely (if ever) attend one. Ive got homework for you. Go to a church Sunday morning. If you dont want to sit through the sermon, just duck in, grab a bulletin, and slip out the side door before all the praying starts. And read through the charitable opportunities. Just about any church in the country will have dozens of them - feeding the homeless at a soup kitchen, staffing the churchs food pantry, delivering (and recieving) donations of clothes/furniture/etc. There are costs involved in those things - and those things benefit the community. Feel free to trust the government to provide all the help you need - but working in the field I do, I can assure you that the government (and its provision of social aid) is dysfunctional on a good day. Regarding states receiving funds from DC - first, those numbers are QUITE stale. That said, is the amount of funding the federal government sucks up, only to send back to states with strings attached an issue? Absolutely. If our tax code (and government hierarchies) were structured as the Constitution/founders envisioned, you would be paying the highest taxes to your local govt, followed by state, followed by federal. Unfortunately it doesnt work that way, and the federal government sucks up money so that it can bribe and cajole states into homogeneity. The thing is, most Americans dont WANT to have to rely on a federal safety net - but theyre given no choice. When the federal government sucks up 15% of your income to nominally cover Social Security and Medicare (news flash - youre paying the employer share; your employer earmarks it toward employing you, and itd be in your pocket if they didnt have to pay it), then yes - people reasonably believe that they have a right to those services. Go figure. Of course, like anything else, the government is completely unable to provide that coverage in a cost effective way, and instead operates a shell game that would get those managing any private company or insurer providing similar coverage prosecuted and thrown in jail. "
"&gt; Rs believe that its not the governments job to help my neighbor. Its mine. Ds believe that ultimately you as an individual have no personal responsibility to help your neighbor - thats the governments job. Since I live in probably the reddest of red states and virtually every person I deal with is hard-core conservative, I can verify the first part of your claim (about the Rs), as I have personally heard this sentiment proudly and publicly stated *numerous* times. However, I do not believe the second claim (about the Ds claiming no personal responsibility for their neighbor because its the governments job). I have *never* heard anyone (R or D) ever say such a thing. In fact, I have read and heard numerous liberal leaning folks say exactly the opposite -- that we all have personal responsibility for our neighbors, even though that does not excuse the government (which also is all of us) from doing its part (which in many cases simply *cannot* be done adequately on an individual or charitable organization level). "
"MIT research says otherwise. Political affiliation has no bearing on amount of charity, just to which charities people donate. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2148033 So it is not that one group is inherently more charitable than the other. Things like roads, power, internet, firemen, police, etc are all either government run or heavily taxpayer subsidized because they are things that individuals cannot do effectively. Our responsibility to each other can only be fulfilled by both charity and effective use of government but not simply one or the other. As an example about health care I like to use the analogy what if police departments were not government funded? Society would incur some very high costs due to crime, lawlessness, vigilantism, and the resulting socioeconomic impacts. Policing would become a privilege reserved for those who could afford police insurance while others would be hesitant to call the police for fear of not being able to pay the bill. Health care is the same. With our current for-profit system we incur very high costs from things like insurance overhead, bankruptcies from care, lack of preventative care due to cost, high costs due to ER overuse, and the fear factor of being one illness away from losing your lifes savings and home. Health care is a privilege reserved for those who can afford health insurance while others are hesitant to get care for fear of not being able to pay the bill. With this analogy it is easy to see that socialized healthcare makes sense just like a socialized police department. Nobody should suffer economic ruin due to no fault of their own. If anybodys home is robbed the police should investigate and recover their property at no extra cost. If anybody gets cancer they should get the care they need to recover at no extra cost. In either case of police or health, charity cannot *guarantee* these things for all americans. It is not about charity vs government but about most effectively, efficiently, fairly, and *totally* (nobody excluded) fulfilling our most important social responsibilities to each other."
"The problem is when things like money given to churches or other similar institutions counts as charity, like Romneys compulsory tithe to the Mormon Church. Meanwhile, red states [take more money from the federal government than they pay in taxes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/26/blog-posting/red-state-socialism-graphic-says-gop-leaning-state/), all while complaining about taxes at every possible chance. And of course, when something goes wrong, theyre always ready to stand in line with one hand outstretched for federal handouts and the other hand giving the finger (see: Texas on the fertilizer explosion). Ultimately, Id rather have a social safety net guaranteed by the state than have to rely on someone elses charity in my time of need. So do most Americans, whether they think so or not - thats why attacking Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is tantamount to political suicide."
"With all due respect, your perception of Republican principles and reality are incompatible with one another. I dont say that as a Democrat, but as a political independent who knows better after working with powerful and wealthy Republicans over several decades. &gt;Rs believe that its not the governments job to help my neighbor. Its mine. Ds believe that ultimately you as an individual have no personal responsibility to help your neighbor - thats the governments job. First, creating charity cases of ones fellow Americans is not an American ideal yet that is the growing direct result of Conservative economic and fiscal public policies over 30 years (and counting). If self-reliance was the Republican goal, it would have succeeded in creating LESS need for social services NOT more. Since many Republicans conveniently forget, the U.S. economy and budget tanked on their watch from their public policies. Blaming the consequences from Republican policies on Democrats is beyond disingenuous and an outright lie. Second, if Republicans believe the government has no meaningful role in this society, why do they insist upon being its largest beneficiaries through Federal Reserve monetary policy, tax cuts, subsidies, no-bid contracts, etc. That, too, is inconsistent with their principles. It should be noted that the U.S. is getting its ass handed to it in global trade because U.S. trading partner governments LEAD macroeconomic policy making, NOT their private sectors. Abdicating economic policy-making to multinational corporations amounts to economic suicide and this is blatantly evident across the U.S. You claim that Democrats are charitable with other peoples money, yet it is Republicans who allow their true constituents (i.e., top 1% and large corporations) to avoid paying taxes while sticking it to the lower/middle class. Shifting that tax burden to others means Republicans are spending OTHER peoples money, to quote your disdain. Furthermore, since Republicans have seen fit to blow up the national budget and persistently refuse to raise taxes based on where the money actually resides, they make matters worse by championing burdensome tax policies on those who can least afford to shoulder it thereby worsening national poverty and the need for social services. Third, as someone more than a little familiar with the charitable giving and tax compliance of very wealthy people, I can assure you that as individual incomes rise, the amount of charitable giving FALLS. You are peddling a myth to try to unjustly lower tax rates for people who dont deserve to get tax breaks. Finally, Conservatives dont have a messaging problem, they have a deeply flawed and self-destructive ideology PROBLEM. Championing broken ideological beliefs and policies is NOT a formula for success, no matter what Modern Conservatives tell themselves. Frank Luntz may be a master of disguising that failure, but it is STILL failure and always will be. So throw away Franks lipstick and use that Randian hog to throw a barbecue instead. Its the only way Republicans will stand any chance of remaining relevant in this society."
"I know quite a bit about each of those things, actually. But thanks for the constructive comment!"
So what youre saying is you dont know what current politicians or voters believe. Got ya. Or how taxes work.
"Sorry, your argument is based on one link, and that link is clearly bogus. &gt; The eight states whose residents gave the highest share of their income ? Utah, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, Idaho, Arkansas and Georgia. Who wants to take a guess what that charity-giving in those states amounts to? Heres a hint - Utah is number 1. "
"Not really. I mean, I think they do an OK job at researching things, but when it comes to interpretation, they seem to skew things in the name of balance. Also, I can imagine people go there and just look at the truth-o-meter without reading the whole article, which is pretty problematic. So I prefer just looking things up on my own and making my own opinion."
factcheck.org was my go to during the elections last year.

The Bloomberg poll is currently closer to an outlier than an accurate state of job approval. Polling averages have Obama at a nine point deficit for approval.

"&gt;In the face of estate taxes, Leverett?s family has had to sell sections of their ranch in order to generate enough liquid assets to meet those obligations and stay afloat. Huh? That says they had to sell off some assets to keep their *inherited* business going. &gt;Why? Just get rid of them, its fucking frightening that people have to put a burden on their children when they die. Um...burden? Yes, its common sense that the rest of us pay taxes on money we actually have to work for, but gods forbid we burden Paris Hilton or the Kochs with paying taxes on money they inherit."
"&gt;The way the estate tax is levied is problematic, and it causes many farm and family businesses to be liquidated upon the death of the owner in order to meet the obligation for the tax. The GOP claims that in every election and never presents a single example of that. Even if they were able to find one example, that would simply indicate the law needs tweaking."

"Excerpt: The basis for the line was Governor Palins 11 September 2008 appearance on ABC News, her first major interview after being tapped as the vice-presidential nominee. During that appearance, interviewer Charles Gibson asked her what insight she had gained from living so close to Russia, and she responded: Theyre our next-door neighbors, and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska: As to the question of whether one can actually see Russia from Alaska, Governor Palin was correct: such a view is possible from more than one site in that state. A Slate article on the topic noted that: In the middle of the Bering Strait are two small, sparsely populated islands: Big Diomede, which sits in Russian territory, and Little Diomede, which is part of the United States. At their closest, these two islands are a little less than two and a half miles apart, which means that, on a clear day, you can definitely see one from the other. Also, a 1988 New York Times article reported that: To the Russian mainland from St. Lawrence Island, a bleak ice-bound expanse the size of Long Island out in the middle of the Bering Sea, the distance is 37 miles. From high ground there or from the Air Force facility at Tin City atop Cape Prince of Wales, the westernmost edge of mainland North America, on a clear day you can see Siberia with the naked eye. Read more at http://snopes.com/politics/palin/russia.asp#Q3VVs2pwHQZrJIik.99 EDIT: Wow. In politics, truth hurts!"
"Yes, but it was a play on Palin saying, You can see Russia from Alaska. Tomato/tomatillo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXL86v8NoGk"
Exactly. He asked about insight and she talked about how there is a place in AK where you can see Russia. I dont think anyone is unsure whether she is an idiot.
"Even if you thought a group was less biased, would you trust them to the point of having them dictate what can or cannot be said? "
Think about what it would be like if you had a government version of Factcheck.org.
Just think if we had an unbiased Factcheck.org.
"I blame the ACA for being fundamentally flawed - it is a health insurance mandate. It is *not* universal health care. If it was, then we shouldnt even be having this problem."
"i hope you realize that the ACA was written by the insurance companies, how awesome would it be if you were forced to buy their product. this is exactly what the ACA is. a direct tax to insurance companies. why anyone would be for this is inconceivable. either we are going to have regular free market insurance or single payer, not this profit driven bullshit envisioned by the insurance companies. everyone agrees the insurance companies are crooks, so why do we want them controlling this whole thing? kick those fuckers out, fuck this fascism."
"I guess the obvious question is, how did this article get approved by Fox News?"
"really, pass a bill that changes a huge portion of the economy without reading whats inside it and you expect people to blame people other than those who wrote and approved it. Youve become a joke r/politics"
"Nevermind the fact that the FedGov was responsible for fucking up the healthcare market ***in the first place***. No, of course we have to ignore that, because government is a shining beacon of hope, casting its clean light through the darkness and evil that is humanity. Except of course that governments are responsible for killing more people in the history of humanity than any other cause. "
Does anyone else see this as one of the most capitalistic things that we passed? You are required to buy insurance from a private insurance company or suffer to pay a fine. I see this as a complete win for the insurance companies. Edit: I accidentally a word
"universal healthcare would have fixed it, you cant regulate these private companies into doing the right thing. They will exploit every loophole possible to not insure you or cover as little as possible to continue profits"
"Stop, collaborate and listen. This is an insurance MANDATE. Meaning, insurance companies realized, Hey, we should make everyone HAVE to have healthcare then did some financying, and boom, realized that paying Obama a sum of money to make this happen still would be a drop in the bucket compared to what they will make when there is 100% enrollment."
People are going to blame Obama and the ACA for this. Obama said that everybody could keep their insurance and he was wrong.
"This is propaganda bullshit. No surprise from Fox. (Red/blue doesnt matter to them as much as having titillating stories.) It says that people should be angry at their insurance companies for not providing essential health benefits. Well, who decided to settle for the cheaper insurance policies to begin with? If you want your insurance to pay for an ambulance ride, guess what? You should shop for and buy a policy that pays for ambulance rides. You want mental health parity? Shop for and buy a policy that covers it. Of course such policies are more expensive; welcome to an economy. Yes, the government is forcing people to get better insurance, and in many cases thus forcing them to pay more for insurance. Even if the end result is a healthier country, the fact remains that people are being forced to buy specific products, whether they want it or not, for their own good. Nike usually makes nice shoes. Back when I had a pair of Nike sneakers, I admit the shoe aspect of my life was noticeably improved in some ways. But I no longer have them, and for many reasons (financial, moral, aesthetic, functional, or whatever reason I damn well please) I do not desire to buy another pair. I view the ACA as equivalent to forcing every American to buy a pair of Nike sneakers. You refuse? Pay a fine. You refuse to pay? Have your wages garnished. You structure your finances to resist? Go to jail. You refuse and resist the cops? Get forcibly arrested. You resist, which necessitates violence against the police? Get shot and die. God Bless America^TM"
The insurance companies that dumped money into Obamas campaign and helped write the PPACA bill? *Those* insurance companies?
"So, we allowed the market to regulate insurance, and insurance became low cost covering almost nothing. So now we have a minimum standard being enforced by regulations. Of course there will be insurance companies doing the minimum. "
"This is a terrible argument. The promise was If you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance. This literally means that even if your insurance is shitty, you can choose to keep it rather than enrolling in a new plan thats ACA-approved. The whole reason for the promise was BECAUSE people were afraid of their rates going up and having to take coverage for things they didnt need, which is exactly what has happened. You cant now claim that Americans should have known that actually meant You can keep your insurance as long as the government ALSO likes it. That is a total non-promise and basically means If youre already complying with the new system, you can continue to comply! which functionally means nothing."
"Licensed insurance agent here. The reason your current plans are being discontinued is because they dont meet the requirements as an ACA plan. To qualify the plan must: 1.) Include the 10 Essential Health Benefits 2.) Must meet the minimum standard of a Bronze level, so you will not pay more than 9.5% of your yearly income. Now what most people need to understand is that you may qualify for a premium tax credit that can lower your monthly premiums and also get a plan that can lower your cost shares, such as deductibles and copays, when you use your benefits. Many of the plans youre being offered are based on your Federal Poverty Level which is calculated by your household size and income. If you are less than 138% you would qualify for Medicaid. If your between 139% and 250% you will some form of tax credit either in a monthly deduction or in a lump sum at the end of the year in your tax return. All the plans you would get are EXACTLY THE SAME. The only difference is how much you will be paying in premium vs your out of pocket expenses. Also many if your preventative services (screening, physicals. mammograms. Pap smears, GYN exams, flu shots, etc) are covered in full. Bronze plans were designed for someone who rarely go to the doctor and would rather save on the cost of their premiums per month, use their preventative services only and have the insurance cover them if something catastrophic happens. Silver has a larger premium than bronZe but less out of pockets expenses, yet still a high deductible plan if you dont qualify for a cost share reduction Gold and Platinum plans have a higher premium per month but your deductibles and copays are minimal or 0. Most plans have an out of pocket maximum, which acts as a safety net if you use a lot of your services in any given year. If you meet the OOPM you will be covered at 100% for the remainder of the year as long as you continue to pay your premium So, yes, the poor do get better deals on these plans to make it more affordable but if you are upper middle class or rich, you can afford to pay the premiums you just dont want to because Americans are self centered and greedy. I talk to people all day long about this stuff everyday and its either hit or miss with the reactions. ***Those that qualify for Medicaid are either happy because it will help cover their medical costs or pissed but they have a stigmatism toward being on welfare. ***Those that fall between a FPL of 138% and 199% think the ACA is the best thing that has ever happened. Everyone above 200% are pissed because this was supposed to be more affordable and have to blame Obama for their situation. So before you start blaming the providers think about the fact that they are being required to change the way business is done in order to follow the law. I agreed it could have been done a lot better but it is what it is and theres nothing we can do but complain to our congressman which falls on deaf ears anyway. Should have voted for Ron Paul, America. "
So is it technically illegal for health insurers to continue selling these swiss-cheese coverage policies or are they just dumping them because they can no longer characterize them as insurance? 
"Holy shit. I tend to look at all media with a skeptical eye, so Im not trying to sound biased here but I cant believe this is a Fox News link. Itd be similar to seeing MSNBC publish an article agreeing with Ted Cruz. Kind of refreshing to see, really."
Thats the damn truth. The insurance companies have always been the issue and continue to be the issue. I got into an argument with someone over the weekend who was trying to tell me that a friend of a friend already got fined for not purchasing insurance because ObamaCare removed her from the plan she just purchased and said she hadnt done it. 
My premium went from 100 to 300 dollars. 
"I thought this was a law. Meaning everything is written down somewhere outlining all of the provisions. I know that it was a crazy long bill, but each word of it was voted into law. If Obama was saying all of this stuff in his speeches and it was wrong according to the bill, how was his wording never corrected before? (Especially because this was such a big concern over the ACA before it was voted into law)"
Although this is a good article I am surprised that the mods arent considering Fox a partisan site.
"No. Im gonna blame Obama too. He handed them the pen, he lied about not having to change. Theyre all on the same team."
Unfortunately Obama just handed the ball off to the insurance companies.
The problem is the ACA forces insurance companies to provide better insurance which i believe is the reason that the companies are dropping coverage in the first place
Am I going crazy!? Even Foxnews says dont blame Obama! Who knew they were capable of telling the truth for once. Looks like the tide is finally turning against the super capitalist oil barons and the Kochtopus New World Order. 
Side rant: these are people oppose expanding Medicaid to help poor people getting better health care - thats an actual quote from this article. Its getting harder and harder to find articles without glaring spelling or grammatical issues these days. And this is from a professional journalist.
"Serious question: why wasnt this accounted and planned for? Also, why arent there any penalties for these insurance companies? Edit: Used isnt instead of arent in a rush"
Goddamn /r/politics loves the opinion page.
[deleted]
"I heard a woman on the radio this morning complaining that her insurance premium was jumping from ~$280/mo to ~$600/mo. I thought this was unreasonable until she said she was also qualified for a $300/mo federal subsidy. What really got me angry was when she said she was upset about not seeing any benefits from paying more...ignoring the fact that she now has better health insurance because the ACA prevents a lot of deceptive insurance practices that she no longer is subject to. edit: unreasonable, not reasonable"
"First this sub called anyone claiming their insurance was canceled a liar. Then they used the excuse that the insurance those that had their policies canceled was substandard. Then you blamed the states for not implementing exchanges. Now its the insurance companies faults. Is liberalism inherently this disingenuous, or are you people simply running for cover? "
This would be like saying the government ?forces? chemical companies to dispose of toxic waste safely rather than dumping it in the river. Im pretty sure these are the types of Regulations the Republicans talk about all then time.
"Obamacare forced me out of my van down by the river, and into new public housing, all subsidized. THE HORROR!"
Fox News is on the front page now? Im trying to not unsubscibe but its getting harder every day.
"The purpose of the ACA, and why its called the Affordable Care Act to begin with, is to allow people who previously would have been unable to purchase health insurance because of a pre-existing condition or because it was too expensive, thus the subsidies. The young healthy sector of the population already had affordable health care available to them. Private companies would decline people over the most minor pre-existing condition or for sure exclude any coverage related to it from the policy. The best part about the whole act which people dont realize is theyre being forced by the government to buy something from private companies. Also, insurance isnt a charity, and you can be sure the people crunching numbers are going to know what rates must be charged to keep the companies afloat. The people who will see the biggest financial impact are young entrepreneurs. If their business is successful, they wont be subsidy elgible AND will be paying higher rates to make up for the increase in claim volume and pay out by the people now being allowed into the health insurance pool. "
This is on foxnews.com? Am I being trolled right now? I feel like Im being trolled right now.
I think the real shock came from seeing this on a FOX news website
"Somewhat agree, except that I took out a high deductible policy with other insurance policies for critical health to match my current needs. I dont mind switching to something different if it works better for everyone, but all changes result in winners and losers."
r/politics in general: I disagree with what you are disagreeing with! Maybe thats why I have negative karma here.. I listen to points that are valid and based on truth. 
"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/11/05/insurance-cancelled-dont-blame-obama-or-aca-blame-america-insurance-companies/ Insurance cancelled? Dont blame Obama or the ACA, blame Americas insurance companies "
"Another typical, slanted, pro-Obama article from the deranged leftists over at Faux News."
As someone who works as a middleman between hospitals and Insurance companies....you can place most the blame for all the health care problems on the insurance companies
A 23 year old single male has a substandard plan if it doesnt include Maternity and Newborn Care. lol 
"So the government forces you to not have a choice, but its your insurance companies fault for not already providing what the government believes is best for you?"
Who do you think Obama was working for? Who do you think the ACA was written for?
"Insurance companies are businesses, not charities. "
"Saying that the cancellations are the insurance companies fault is misleading because, even though the cancellations were made the the insurance companies, it was in direct response to the regulatory structure set up in Obamacare. Which is to say that these policies wouldnt have been cancelled if Obamacare didnt exist."
"FAUXNEWS ? WE DONT take FAUXNEWS links!!!!! Oh, unless they agree with our narrative, then, yeah, sure, we can take em."
**Dont blame Obama. Blame someone else.** /r/politics should make it the official tagline.
"Yeah, dont blame Obama since he knew about this clear back in 2010 but continuously lied about it anyway. &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;"
"I am surprised to see an article like this on FoxNews.com of all places, but I said this very same thing in this thread: http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/29/21222195-obama-administration-knew-millions-could-not-keep-their-health-insurance?lite when there was a thread about it on reddit, and I was downvoted for pointing this out"
"Im in total agreeance with Juan and Reddit on this matter. As long as a government employee, whether it be the president or whomever, believes they are acting in my best interest, they can lie to me all they want, I trust them. Maybe Obama did know that some people werent gonna be able to keep their coverage, but if he had told the truth the bill might not have passed. The end justifies the means. "
This is all on Obama. All of it. The whole fiasco.
"I am amazed that people find this shocking still. This was never about providing healthcare for the masses. This was about ensuring capitalism and the insurance companies maintain a profit. Providing healthcare to the masses leads to a universal healthcare plan where it is taxed from the people and coverage is free and sponsored by the taxes. This bill simply makes it mandatory for people to have to buy insurance from the private sector companies under the guise of regulation. Come the fuck on, am I the only one here that sees this buckshot for what it is?!?!"
"ITT: I learned that as long as the people getting screwed over are the young, the middle class, or reasonably healthy, its good policy. Because Obama is awesome."
Blame? They should be grateful that they are now receiving a plan much better than whatever crappy insurance they had. They also should be honored by the privilege that it is to pay more for their plan because its good for their president and their country. 
This article is misleading at best. ACA REQUIRED insurance policies to have full coverage for things that some people dont need. Liked pre-naale coverage and breastpumps for a single male. If it wasnt for the ACA people could get policies that covered what they actually needed instead of being forced to pay for coverage they dont...
Did... Did I just read an article from Fox News that had Dont Blame Obama in the title? I need a minute...
Whats with all these Fox links with liberal sounding titles recently? Fuck Fox. Are they trying to test-market us liberals now that their viewers are dying off?
"I saw Juan on OReilly last night, it was painful. Agree with what he says or not, he couldnt get 3 words in edgewise against Bill and the woman he was sharing the segment with (dont know her name, but she was essentially cheerleading Bills attacks on Juan/ACA)"
Yes you can blame Obama.
Can we all just take a moment to realize that Fox News is telling people NOT to blame Obama?
"A system that _requires_ everyone to buy a product, so theres no free market, and the price goes up.. Thats not rocket science guys, its completely the Obama administrations fault. "
"you can blame the insurance companies all you want, just remember they are companies designed to take advantage of your fear, fear you will get sick or get in an accident. Kind of like being mad at a lion for attacking you. Insurance companies will take every advantage they can b/c you know their primary purpose as businesses is to make money BUT these cancellations and defaults were not happening before ACA so YES I do blame ACA for this...to help 45million uninsured have a chance at insurance, 90 million are going to lose it"
Were Roger Ailes editors sleeping on the job? How did they let something reasonable pass through the dense right wing propaganda that is the entirety of FOX New?
To see this article in **FOX** news makes my heart sing with rapture.
"Man, what a shitstorm. I feel torn because there should be absolutely no reason to deny anyone health coverage. This feels like such a basic right that everyone should have. So, the fact that the uninsurable are able to get coverage makes me happy. But then you have the people who are seeing their rates increase. Needless to say, they are upset about it, and rightfully so. But still, YOU GET INSURANCE. I cant imagine how it must feel to be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. The person that needs the medical coverage most didnt get it, while the people who didnt need it as much get it. Because of the cost of anything medical in this country, a single procedure is enough to crush you financially if you dont have insurance. Im trying not to pick sides here, but if I had to, I would prefer the ACA to the previous plan. But thats really not saying much. They are both pretty bad. If you bring up an argument about the websites functionality, let me stop you right here. The website is bad and everyone knows it. That is not the issue here. The first issue at hand should be to insure as many people as possible. Next, we should look at the price."
"I was blaming them for many of the problems with the American healthcare system. Now, we have a health care law that was written more for the insurance companies benefit than the citizens. "
"So just like with Gitmo, when Prez says something, and it turns out to be a massive lie, as long as there is someone else to blame, then its just as good as if he told the truth. "
Is anyone else completely stunned that the words Dont blame Obama or the ACA are on Fox News site? Its too surreal
"Im pretty sure it was not your insurance company on TV telling you over and over, If you like your insurance, you can keep it. PERIOD. Im really sure that was the President. Im also very sure it was at the Presidents order that the regulations were changed after ObummerCare was passed to remove the grandfathering."
"fuck ofaghole, he lied. nixon lied, impeached, clinton lied, impeached, obozo lies, savior? this lying communist asshole is ripping this nation apart, so he can become supreme leader, kim jong douchbag, the first"
"Hmmm, I can only wonder what the *Employer Mandate* was put on hold for... Obama, a liar who was known to lie and does without accountability, its *still* someone else at fault, never Obama, *never*."
Foxnews.com? What?
I blame the ACA for taking my bare bones plan and plugging it full of shit so i can subsidize everyone else. Just more social justification of taking more of my money and giving it to someone who supposedly needs it more.
"Insurance companies are sleazy and dollar-grubbing machines, but I blame the government just as much for not being able to create a system that functions properly. The insurance industry only operates under the rule and legislature of the American government; change will not happen if its left up to companies who are raking in such monstrous revenues every year. How could any reasonable person expect these companies to change and willingly accept anything that fundamentally changes the system when they are content to squeeze every dollar from the American consumer. Our government is tasked with regulating these industries to ensure that the majority of people are content with the system that it provides. Real change has to come from inside the government and needs to be enforced. I blame any politician who sits by the wayside and allows insurance companies to lobby and freely use their money to support a stagnancy within the system to prevent their inflowing cash to be diverted elsewhere. If you think that insurance companies have the desire or even the capacity to be socially responsible enterprises then you have another thing coming my friend. They want to make money. Thats it. The day an insurance provider proves me wrong will be a glorious day, and I will be happy to hear that I was wrong, but until that day comes we need the government to step in, grow a pair of balls, and govern insurance companies rather than bend over and take it. **TL:DR - Both parties are to blame**"
Thanks Obama
Are the editors at Foxnews.com asleep at their desks? How the fuck did they allow Juan Williams to post that?
"New respect to Fox for publishing this, although it was written by Juan Williams..."
"&gt;Essential health benefits must include items and services within at least the following 10 categories: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.? So as a non-drug-using, mentally healthy male, I have to now pay for pregnancy, newborn care, mental health disorders, drug use problems? So basically essential health benefits is a bullshit, arbitrary definition invented by the administration intended to make people like myself subsidize other peoples costs. **FUCK THAT.**"
"The ACA doesnt really help anyone who was in trouble before the ACA. Im presuming that poor people who dont presently have insurance are going to go with a subsidized plan. All subsidized plans are 60/40 with a max $6500/year out of pocket. That means that the average poor family will still rack up $6500 in medical expenses. Even for a family scraping by on a $30,000/year income, a $6500 bill could bankrupt them, easily. May as well be a million, as far as Im concerned. So essentially, the only benefit I see from the ACA is that people who already have decent insurance cant be disqualified in the future due to pre-existing conditions. Whoop-de-freakin-do."
is this really an article on Fox that isnt blaming Obama for something? did hell freeze over?

"A lot of those Obamacare requirement do NOT even apply to policies you had since March 2010. The only ones that apply to those grandfathered plans are: 1. waiting times 2. no recission 3. no lifetime caps, and 4. if it covers children, it has to till theyre 26. Those are de minimis. So this is just more GOP bullshit. Those cancellations were **completely voluntary** on the part of the insurers. And Obamacare couldnt stop it, because it doesnt even go into effect till 2014! "
I thought we should blame the GOP? Now its the insurance companies? Im so confused!

Do people actually believe it is the Insurance Companies? What a load of garbage...
Blame Yes. Blame. That surely makes sense because we all know every single problem in the world is always solely due to one cause or entity.
"Am I in the twilight zone or did I just read that from Fox News? Honest question from someone who watches Fox; Are all of their contributors starting to take this attitude? Is this a lone effort from Juan Williams? Some of the better quotes: Taking crocodile tears to a new level, ObamaCare opponents are now rushing to their defense and calling the president a liar. Let me put it more bluntly: your insurance companies have been taking advantage of you and the Affordable Care Act puts in place consumer protection and tells them to stop abusing people. "
How come not a single thing is ever Obamas fault? Im not a conservative but I honestly have never seen a president never be at fault or responsible for everything and anything. 
Very surprised this article appeared on such an anti-Obama news corp. But then again seeing the change in OReillys way of presenting himself maybe I shouldnt be too surprised.
Im just surprised to see this type of article on the Fox News website...
"Nope, sorry Juan. People are losing their insurance because of Obama, Pelosi, Reid, and everyone else who voted for Obamacare...all Democrats. And shouldnt this be noted as an opinion piece?"
"How incredibly stupid. Obama and the Democrats caused this mess and are 100% responsible for the outcome. How does one get so superior that they can decide what my insurance needs to be? Why do I, as a 56 year old man, need maternity and birth control coverage? When you interfere with the market, the market eventually wins. Anyone that voted for the man should be ashamed. "
"(Ins coverage is that way to have the same policies offered to men and women. Obviously you dont use all of it. as for coverage they need this is a rightwing lie that ignores the whole concept of insurance. You never once see someone complain that women are being forced to pay to for viagra or prostate cancer, its only that men are being forced to pay for the ladies"
wtf.. foxnews? what the fuck just happened? 
lol except of course Oblahblah and his BFF Billy Tauzin made it illegal NOT to buy their overpriced insurance
Juan Williams wrote this? I thought he was a right wing pundit...
"And before the trolls jump in to say how dare people on the individual market get any tax break (subsidy) for their insurance: Employees ALREADY get subsidised health insurance - no matter how much they earn. In the individual market, free lance workers, self employed, independent contractors and those between jobs only get a subsidy if they make under $28,000. But employees, even the rich ones earning $280,000 get a subsidy of up to 70% off, like Senator Cruzs wife who covers him with a policy that the government subsidises with a tax break given to Morgan Stanley to cut her costs to a third. Individual market people are finally not paying exorbitant prices. Now we get a subsidy too."
"It is the fault of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). All the time the President was claiming that people could keep their coverage and their doctors, he knew he was lying. He still is lying. The President fully intended for people to lose their coverage. We have people with serious conditions such as stage IV cancer who have lost their policies and cannot get coverage. Those people are dying as a direct result of the intentional loss of their insurance due to Obamacare."
If this law had never passed Id still have the insurance that I liked and could afford. Tell me again how this law is not at fault?
"he lied. sorry. you can blame whoever you want. the man said keep your plan, keep your doctor. that didnt turn out to be the case."
"you guys didnt hear? CNN ratings down, Fox is up! I am not making this up! "
In what alternet dimension are we living in that this is coming from Fox? Did I black out white Rupert Murdoch clacked his hoofs and commanded dramatic change?
am i really reading this on fox news?
"as for coverage they need this is a lie that ignores the whole concept of insurance. You never once see someone complain that women are being forced to pay to for viagra or prostate cancer, its only that men are being forced to pay for the ladies)"
"If the government states that the insurance companies can now only offer insurance plans that covers everything the government desires and nothing less while before these companies were offering a variety of products that people wanted and purchased but are now determined illegal or substandard by the government, how is this the insurance companies fault? Is the government going to come out and tell the life insurance companies they can now only offer $1,000,000 life insurance policies and any that they offer that are less than that amount are now determined to be substandard and must be terminated? I have seen numerous people interviewed who actually liked the plans they had before the implementation of Obamacare but can no longer receive these plans because the government has declared their plans illegal and these people are very upset. Why would a 55 year old woman pay for a plan that covers maternity costs? So the plan would be cheaper for women who want that coverage. Fair? No. That 55 year old woman is subsidizing the younger women, is she not? Why should she be required to do such a thing? When is the government going to declare that we may purchase only electric powered automobiles and have our current gasoline powered automobiles declared illegal? Same thing...no? Perhaps the government will provide a subsidy for me to purchase the most expensive $83,570 Tesla. I would need a $40,000 subsidy and several airline tickets each year to get me to get where I need to go where the Tesla will not take me. Fair?"
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE TOO
"Serious question(s): I know a lot of private health insurance companies are canceling policies because they claim that they cant afford to pay for patients with pre-existing conditions.. But is there any other reason they no longer are keeping these policies? Also, are these companies at risk for bankruptcies considering that theyre losing a lot of customers? If so, why arent they trying to compete with the ACA exchanges and change their models? "
"Its not their fault for offering cheaper plans with things that people didnt think they need. Now that they are forced to be offering them whether the consumer wants them or not is ACAs fault, not insurance."
This is being reported by... Fox News? There must be a mix-up.
I think Foxnews.com is broken.
"People bought Chevy plans they were too stupid to not like. Obama is forcing them to pay for government approved Yugos with expensive rims, two cylinders, over-priced boom boxes, five child seats theyll never need and a huge Nancy Pelosi-style spoiler stuck on the back hood in case the car ever goes 200 mph, in case. Obama wouldnt be caught dead driving such an abortion, nor will anyone else named Obama, nor would anyone in the riling elite, but hes mighty upset the little people arent smart enough to thank him for the new model."
Democratic idea proved to be shitty; liberals look for any excuse possible. 
"quick get this off foxnews.com, fast!"
"When the people covered by those substandard policies need an ambulance or maternity coverage or cancer treatment, the rest of us would STILL have to pay for them. They were underinsured, which is worse than being uninsured because of the false sense of security."
welcome to r/politics!
Cooperation is created to maximize profit. We are just surplus value. 
"Yea, Im really going to read a Fox News opinion piece."
[politifact begs to differ](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/03/ezekiel-emanuel/ezekiel-emanuel-says-insurance-companies-canceling/)
"Neither Obama nor the ACA did not address the fundamental problem with healthcare coverage and medical costs, and because it does nothing to solve the problem, its an empty gesture that does very little to help Americans, besides the ones who had nothing in the first place. Personally, if something becomes mandatory, its cost should be regulated. If your bill, named the Affordable Care Act does little to make helathcare affordable, it certainly sounds like its not working as it should. People scream about socialism like its a horrible evil thing, and unchecked, it is. But so is unchecked capitalism. They need each other to reach their full potential, and they need to be regulated to make sure they never tip the scales too far one way or another."
"Another important point is that if you have the plan you had back before the ACA, you are grandfathered into your plan for another year. The insurance company has CHOSEN to cancel the plan now."
Can we still blame everything else on Obama though..
this entire community are idiots. Stop kissing Obamas feet and admit he makes mistakes and lies to his people freely
"Wow, a dont blame Obama headline on fox news. "
Fucking Obama
Presidents just introduce the latest scam to part you with your hard earned pay. Global rich elite capitalists knew they were signing everyone up in a mandatory garnishing of your cash and they also knew they were going to reup everybody (even those who were promised to keep their current plan.) When are you people gonna learn? Promises....then dont keep the promise &amp; turn the screws real hard. Time passes = Normal everyday life. The frogs love them some hot water.
You cocksuckers are shilling so hard on this issue. ACA is a disaster and its not the insurance companies fault. Obama fucked us and lied about it; stop trying to cover this up.
"As a new parent and a person who is having my insurance canceled, yes I was lied to. To keep my premiums relatively the same I have to take a lesser network and lose my doctor and my wifes OBGYN. Tell me you dont care, tell me I can afford it; dont tell me what the president guaranteed me is true. "
Dont read the comments. Youre welcome. Anything to keep people arguing with each other and not realizing that both sides are to blame.
Isnt that capitalism?
Remember when insurance companies were the good guys in healthcare ... yeah neither do I. Of course they have a perfect scape goat to do whatever the hell they want get it while its hot ... Obamas fault.
"No, Im sure it was obamacare. Before obamacare I was happy with my insurance, now with obamacare my insurance was canceled. You cant lie your way out of this one."
"I blame ALL of them... Obama, the abortion known as the ACA... The insurance companies... The democraps... and the republitards.... "

"I am in the insurance industry. I have seen it all from insurance companies. I voted for ACA because I know what goes on inside and their immoral business ethics. I said then and will continue to say that before it gets better its going to be bad and we are going to deal with the nasty strategies insurance companies use and greedy doctors. Well, bring it on! This too shall pass when they realize that they can no longer continue to rape consumers. They had it good for too long by abusing the consumers with garbage plans, selective eligibility, tight underwriting guidelines and not to mention out of control rate increases. This is called legalized thievery in my book! When they see that their tactics are not working this time around and their membership and profits continue to go down, they will be forced to finally be real competitive and stop raping consumers. This is just a strategy to scare consumers and get back at Obama. Enough is enough! Welcome to true capitalism my friends!"
"If you pay taxes to the federal government, and then the federal government uses part of that money to pay for state health care, which will cost 1.46 trillion in the next 10 years or $562 per year for everyone (or double for the 53% of Americans who actually pay income tax). Youre actaully paying two groups for one coverage. Then also factor in the fact that this will only exacerbate the debt crisis which will crash down on us in 10 years or less and basically reduce US dollars to pesos. In the long run Obamacare policies will cost a lot more than any private insurance. Affordable Care is just Obama and the rest of the Democratic Partys terribly implemented solution to bring affordable healthcare to the underclass(since they are the Democrats main voting base) If they really wanted to solve this problem without making 10 more they could push for more medicare and welfare reforms to improve the lower classess standard of living and get most of them working and out spending money frivolously to support the economy and therefore create MORE jobs so more are available. But of course most of that kind of problem-solving would take a long time and be harder to milk for political publicity. Easier to introduce one big controversial bill that solves all and then let the next sucker deal with the 12 epic fuckups it eventually creates. "
is this a joke? please tell me this is a joke
"Nope, sorry but the ACA is at fault. You cant demand compliance and expect compliance without purges. Companies want profit and will go towards maximizing that. When Obama pushed through a lot of credit card regulation bills the first thing my credit card companies did was cancel my cards, reduce my credit limits (most dropped to exactly what I currently owed), and jack up my interest rates. They did all this once it became clear this would become law but before it actually went into effect. I had some cards go from around 10% to over 30% despite never missing a payment. I was almost forced into bankruptcy due to the shock all this suddenly dealt to my credit score and ability to borrow."
Liberals and their neverending wagon of ACA excuses...
Fucking liberal media.

"Im not really frustrated at the change in my medical insurance. Im frustrated by the fact that I just found out that Im being dropped from my parents vision/dental plans. Im under 26 and 90% of my medical expenses come from glasses/contacts and getting my teeth cleaned. The way that the ACA was marketed, I was under the impression I didnt need to worry about this until I was 26. My friends were under the same impression. Can I blame Obama for that?"
"Is this actually Fox News defending (somewhat) the President and the ACA?? Cant be ... I mean its Fox News after all, right?"

Yeah bullshit Ill blame the ACA all day. 
ITT: Men complaining about their new plans as horrible workplace gender inequality. Sympathetic women strangely absent.
"Actuarial Science major here. Ill do my best to explain why insurance companies chose to drop so many policies. Insurance companies have to charge enough money per policy to cover their expected payouts in the event that an insured has a claim. What that means is that all the people who pay for car insurance and DONT get in an accident are essentially helping to pay for all the insureds that DO get in an accident. The same concept applies to health insurance. So, once the ACA went into play, insurance companies had to bring all their current insureds up to the standards put in place by the ACA. The article names a few very basic standards put in place, but I have no doubt there are many, many more standards that were not named (its a truly massive bill). It then became the job of the actuaries and the underwriters to set new prices for all the current insureds policies. The same price couldnt be charged, because the assumed risk, and expected payouts to insureds were not being covered by the current rates. Once the new rates were set, they had to evaluate all their current insureds policies, and figure out if they could even justify continuing to give them coverage at their current rate. The reason for so many dropped policies is that the insurance companies couldnt justify continuing their insureds policies at their set rate, and the insurance companies cant just suddenly charge them more money. Instead, the insurance companies sent out letters to the unfortunate former-insureds detailing what their current policy would cost them after the ACA came into play (note: usually, much more than what they were paying). This didnt have anything to do with insurance companies taking advantage of you, this had to do with a company simply not being able to offer more coverage for the same price. While having a really great health plan for a very low price would be wonderful, its simply not viable. TL;DR: insurance companies were forced to drop many insurance policies because it would cost them too much money to keep them. Insurance companies havent been taking you for granted, they have simply been offering the lowest price they possibly could for the coverage they were giving. Edit: Just to clarify, Im still a senior at college, not in a job setting yet (hopefully will be in December), and Im not claiming to know everything there is to know about insurance or the ACA. Im simply trying to offer some information about how insurance works, and why these policies might have been dropped."
Hear hear
"Im still trying to figure out the need for government run and mandated healthcare and insurance? Why didnt the Obama camp just come up with a tax break to cover health insurance based on income, or soemthing equally simple? All they had to do was pass a law that required all states to offer some form of low income health coverage and care and then a tax break for everyone else proportionate to income, family size and health--basically need! There would have been no need for this monsterous health care plan that has now turned into a HIPAA nightmare and insurance fiasco."
I keep hearing and reading ObamaCARE is going to save people money and offer better coverage... when is the media going to start reporting Americans have purchased better healthcare coverage at cheaper price? 
"Bullshit you moron. How about blaming andromedian aliens? Its free market, of course it will react if you push it. blame them for doing their job?. Oh sorry i forgot its not PC to blame obama cuz hes african. Sorry for entering your sanctuary of sacred saint obama of africa please dont lynch me cuz im racist cuz i blame obama"
"Dont know about blame, but leaders are naive (not just Obama) to neglect 2nd order effects. They design a change, a grand vision, assuming that every other aspect of the system will remain static, and neglect to take into consideration how the system will react to their change."
Isnt it surprising to read something on Fox News that is not rabidly anti Obama?
Nice try.

"Basically the derivative is negative, but the function is still positive."
"I understand and I agree. But for most of those that care so deeply about this now, did not care so much when it was a R as president. They want to misunderstand this. The same way that a large portion of those same people think O is a Muslim or Antichrist or secular atheist. At one point a majority of conservative republicans believed all three. Which is impossible you might say. Cognitive dissonance. The important thing to remember is most Republicans think that the yearly budget deficit is increasing, therefore they dont deserve to be part of any policy discussion Edit. Note changing note above. read the replies and then what I said. I regret that I phrased it as angrily as it appears. Someone mentioned that this is how Democracy works, but I would argue that that is how a representative Republic like ours does work. Sure you get to vote, but if you are not only not contributing to the discussion, but trying to burn the system down, then dont be surprised if you are not being followed by those that want to fix the country"
"Do you really think thats a fair analogy? Comparing human weight fluctuation to economical fluctuation is a little bit of a stretch. In economics, patterns are a lot more important, and there is no way Rome can be built in a day considering our debt and economy."
"The real issue is people understanding (or not understanding) the difference between the annual budget deficit and the national debt. Theyre both words that start with de and mean youve spent more money than you took in. Our *deficit* is going down but our *debt* is still increasing. Many republicans (and some democrats) want us to start paying down the *debt*, which means we need a budget surplus, rather than a deficit. A comparable analogy would be an obese person gaining 15 pounds a year over the last 10 years, and then only gaining 9 pounds this year. Its still not good that theyre gaining weight, but its better than the alternative. For real health, they need to lose weight."
"Yes debt is still increasing. we had a surplus and[ a president paying down our debt and it was projected to pay all of our deb](http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/08/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-touts-fiscal-record-president-during-/)t, but then the right got scared of healthcare reform and [starved the beast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast).. which is political cute for bankrupting the fuck out of the nation Obama actually had a few surplus months, but it is hard to do that a lot right now due to how many people are without jobs and depending on welfare. we were actually on [our way back to surplus, as long as the bush tax cuts expired which they didnt.](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/aug/07/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-was-path-balanced-budget-when/) &gt;A comparable analogy would be an obese person gaining 15 pounds a year over the last 10 years, and then only gaining 9 pounds this year.

You are ignoring we are getting much taller at the same time, and then it still doesnt work because that would cause issues too. Our BMI is staying pretty much the same is the point.

Notice they didnt try to fix shit under bush when they had full power. **DEBTS GOING UP BUT SO IS GDP.. DONT BE A LOW EFFORT, YOU CANT LEAVE THAT PART OUT.** "
The only measure of debt that is meaningful is the ratio of debt to gdp. This is falling.
YES! Thank you.
"&gt; Many republicans (and some democrats) want us to start paying down the debt, which means we need a budget surplus, rather than a deficit. too bad none of them want to start paying higher taxes to create that surplus."
"Some think the US National debt is not totally bad, and that it actually works to stabilize the US dollar by encouraging other nations to invest in it, making it the worlds reserve currency. The Clinton administration even wrote [a report](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/10/21/141510617/what-if-we-paid-off-the-debt-the-secret-government-report) looking at the risks of paying of the debt quickly. Basically, US debt is financed through treasury securities. You get rid of US debt, and you get rid o treasury securities, considered one of the worlds lowest risk investment vehicles. "
"Poor analogy. These sort of breezeovers drive me crazy. Look, as the dollar gets weaker AND the GDP gets larger, the debt will increase. Ill give you a better analogy. Imagine in 2000 you earned, say, $30,000, just as a good round #. You have $500 in credit card debt. Its not ideal, but its relatively low compared to the average person. Now, its 2013, and your career has progressed, with you making now $60,000. You have $650 in credit card debt. Oh my fucking God!! Debt is out of control! It keeps on going higher and higher... But wait, its actually lower than it was, based on your net wealth. And wait... due to depreciation of the dollar, its even LESS than that. Thats whats going on. The government deficit is going down AND the debt is going down in relationship to the GDP. Of course, this could all be easily solved by just bringing taxes up to the Clinton Levels (or God forbid, the 1950s, where wed have a glut surplus), dropping aid to most foreign countries who are self-sufficient or dont care about us, tax subsidies to oil companies, stripping down trillion dollar military programs they dont even want (e.g. tanks), etc, etc, but we couldnt possibly do that, could we? Sorry, I just had to post this before my eyes started bleeding. Too many utter fucking idiots use this as a rallying point when they dont get it right, thereby completely ignoring the vanishing middle class. If it wasnt Congress and Washington DC clamoring for this in their little BUBBLE, the real issue of jobs and lowering wages would be #1, which is what it is for main street, and has been for way too long. "
Gaining weight is okay if youre also getting taller (i.e. GDP is increasing).
"&gt; A comparable analogy would be an obese person gaining 15 pounds a year over the last 10 years, and then only gaining 9 pounds this year. Its still not good that theyre gaining weight, but its better than the alternative. For real health, they need to lose weight. Thats actually a terrible analogy: you can increase the absolute debt while decreasing the debt in a practical sense. Huh?, you might say -- but the real metric for looking at debt is debt *as a percentage of GDP*. [US debt grew for the entire decade of the 60s](http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/usgs_line.php?title=Gross%20Public%20Debt&amp;units=r&amp;size=l&amp;year=1960_1970&amp;sname=US&amp;bar=0&amp;stack=1&amp;col=c&amp;legend=&amp;source=a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a&amp;spending0=0.36_0.37_0.38_0.40_0.41_0.42_0.44_0.45_0.49_0.50_0.52), but debt as a percentage of GDP [shrank quite significantly](http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/usgs_line.php?title=Gross%20Public%20Debt&amp;units=p&amp;size=l&amp;year=1960_1970&amp;sname=US&amp;bar=0&amp;stack=1&amp;col=c&amp;legend=&amp;source=a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a&amp;spending0=68.48_67.49_65.52_64.00_61.53_58.66_55.29_54.55_53.84_50.72_50.51), by about 20 percentage points."
"This analogy actually comes teasingly close to being good, but falls pretty flat. A better way to look at it, is deficit is the food you take in, debt is your weight. Your metabolism is your after inflation interest rate, and your muscle is the overall strength of the economy. Every persons health weight is different, and every person will gain weight at a different rate with the same food intake. A person who works out constantly, and flexes his muscles all over the place is going to have a really high metabolism (a SUPER low real interest rate, for the US, it is negative). In fact, the person NEEDS to eat more as they put on more muscle to keep up their activity level. Thats ok, because they keep putting on more muscle to offset the increased food intake. This is especially true when the person has been slacking and hasnt been working out hard. He needs his protein to build that muscle back up (stimulus spending) Sometimes, the person will get wasted a put on a ton of empty calories (wars, tax cuts that dont generate economic growth) and has to go on a diet to get down to a more ideal weight, but that doesnt mean he COMPLETELY stops eating, he just needs to keep working out so that his muscle gain can catch up to his weight gain. If the person lets his weight get too out of control, he gets lethargic and his joints start to hurt, and if it gets really out of control he can have a heart attack (like the world economy losing faith in the dollar) Obviously, no one is going to gain muscle forever (and some people would say you cant have strong GDP growth forever either) but so far the US has been able to keep its growth rate high enough that our debt has had minimal impact on our ability to increase growth. We had a few years of binge eating and our weight was starting to get out of control, but now we are getting back to a more reasonable food intake and we can get back to our previous workout schedule. "
Except that running a deficit helps in keeping the economy healthy and running budget surplus can make it sick.
Youre absolutely right. Its surprising how many people think we had zero debt after the Clinton presidency. They mistake the debt for deficit and somehow come to the conclusion that most of our 17 trillion dollars of debt accumulated while Bush was in office. Its not just the politically uninformed that confuse the two: [Heres a clip of **Jon Stewart** getting called out by Bill O Reiley for not understanding the difference between debt and deficit during their 2012 debate.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZTUW-9XB_M)
"&gt; A comparable analogy would be an obese person gaining 15 pounds a year over the last 10 years, and then only gaining 9 pounds this year. Its still not good that theyre gaining weight, but its better than the alternative. For real health, they need to lose weight. Thats a very incomplete and misleading analogy. There wouldnt be anything particularly stupendous about paying off all of the sovereign debt. In fact, unless there are literally zero investment opportunities, not being in debt would mean that the government were stunting the economy. The only important thing is that we dont acquire so much debt that creditors begin to doubt our ability to pay it back, which would lead to higher interest rates, which would eventually lead to default and economic depression. The location of the threshold for too much is unknown, but is also roughly a factor of the GDP. One political party certainly thinks we are very close to that threshold, but there isnt really anyone but them making any noise about it, especially since the deficit has been decreasing lately. What the Tea Party fails to understand is that the true problem in the budget is not the short term deficits (which are falling and dont matter anyways), but the long term projected escalation in the cost of social programs such as social security. In order to pay for those, we will need more revenue, which means that the only thing that matters from a budget perspective is economic growth over the next 20-30 years. That is why it would really be better to accept a larger deficit now for the sake of increased investment. "
Republicans want us to go an an anorexic crash diet. Tea Partiers want us to weigh 0 pounds.
"Except when were talking the U.S. government, the annual income to the government is in the range of 2.5 trillion, and the debt is 6.5 times that."
"A budget surplus? The hell you say, time to start cutting taxes!"
"So what do you not understand about Bush being handed a surplus and then blowing it and then overseeing the financial crisis Greenspan said couldnt happen? Further, in order to reduce the debt you need to first reduce the deficit. Step 1 in progress. You cant just cut spending to the point where the debt goes down without balancing this with revenues and over time to deal with the financial crisis. What Republicans will say is, theyre approach to blocking everything is the reason the deficit is going down. But they are dead wrong, the lack of the ability for Obama to increase spending when it was needed to get people back to work has been blocked and increase revenues on the rich, this is costing us too much money in the long run and is counter productive to reducing the debt. In fact Republicans have and continue to do the opposite of being fiscally conservative."
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_analogy http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/podcasts/critical_reasoning_for_beginners Weight and government income are not remotely analogous. Theres no magical Anti-weight like an increasing GDP, or income growth, or the ability to raise taxes. Its just a childish and incoherent way of trying to simply an economic issue into a kindergarten lecture."
"&gt;Theres no magical Anti-weight like an increasing GDP Increasing height? &gt; the ability to raise taxes Exercise? But in all seriousness, the whole point was that something can continue to get worse while the rate at which it gets worse slows. Yes, there are other variables, and Id have to look at a shitton of economists opinions to determine at what rate the debt can increase without being harmful (but even liberal economists on NPR often say that were reaching a rubicon), but it is possible for the debt to increase at a slowing rate and for that to be a bad thing if the original rate was severe, and that was my point."

It isnt and our debt is way to high, but its important to keep in mind that a high debt is a relative term. 0 debt means are currency is worthless.

"Posted further up the page This news broke 9 months ago--good to see its still making the email rounds. From Factcheck.org: The email suggests Feinstein ? described as a ?powerful U.S. Senator from San Francisco? ? misused her office to secure a ?sweet deal? for her husband. But there is no evidence of that. Sue Brennan, a Postal Service spokeswoman, told us in an email that seven firms participated in a competitive bidding process. She said the Postal Service chose CBRE Group because it ?was the contractor with the best overall organization, capability and experience.? Other than being a member of Congress, Feinstein holds no unique position of authority over the Postal Service. She is not a member, for example, of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which has jurisdiction over the Postal Service. To the contrary, Feinstein cosponsored an amendment to the 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2012 that tried to limit post office closings. Although the amendment was approved in the Senate, the bill was ?held at the desk? when it was sent to the House. It never made it to the House floor. The email also claims that CBRE Group receives a 6 percent commission ?on each and every one? of the Postal Service properties it sells. That is inaccurate. According to Brennan, ?the rate of commission varies by the value of the transaction based on a scaled fee structure.? "

Are you refering to the Obamaphone conservaties are always raging about? 
You mean the [Reaganphone]( http://www.snopes.com/politics/taxes/cellphone.asp).
Yeah. That one. It infuriates the conservatives I know when I point out Reagan began the program and Bush expanded it to cover cell phones. 
Obamas statement was clearly 100% true. The Mostly true rating is just Politifact being ridiculous. I am guessing that this is Politifacts attempt to create a false right-left equivalence. See also http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/politifact-r-i-p/
"Probably. They cant stand saying the left is 100% true without getting flak from the right. Look, if Obama screws up, then challenge him for what hes openly screwed up, like the NSA and the wikileaks-related trials and such. But the right cant stand him being right on anything."
"I believe Politifacts concern, contrary to whats being said by some, isnt so much the inflation as the very careful wording only including the *start* of Reagans term. The minimum wage under Reagan varied from more to less than todays, since Reagan was the only president since its inception to not oversee an increase. "
"What? How are you saying that? Its mostly true because its FALSE for multiple years. You are a fool or a shill for saying otherwise. Its not a false equivalence, its a fact that its mostly true. "
Please never use anything Paul Krugman write as an actual source. Not only is he a political whore but he takes the Keynesian view to the next level. Such a hack
"Youre probably right on some level, as they are trying to find ways to seem critical of the President to make their website seem less biased. However, I do appreciate Politifact evaluating not just the literal nature of what a politician says, but also the context and the spirit surrounding the statement. By itself, the Presidents statement is correct, but he *is* invoking Reagan to tug at conservatives heartstrings and make them feel like theyre letting Reagans legacy down in some way. I am generally an Obama fan, but this isnt the first time he and the Democrats have implied false notions while remaining 100% factually correct. A great example was how they talked about birth control in the last election--they never *said* all Republicans want to take away birth control, but by saying Republicans want to limit a womans access to birth control they heavily implied it (and it was technically true as Republicans opposed the birth control mandate). As a result, a lot of female voters believed Republican mainstream candidates like Mitt Romney truly wanted to ban birth control for all women. Republicans do something similar when they imply Obama is not Christian. I dont think thats a false equivalency..."
"It was rated mostly true because Obamas phrasing was designed to lead people to draw their own false conclusions. Obama could have said 30 years ago instead of when Reagan took office. Dragging Reagan into it leads people to draw false conclusions, e.g. Even super-conservative Ronald Reagan set higher minimum wages! Additionally, many people will come away from that speech mis- remembering the statistic as Minimum wage is lower now than it was **while Reagan held** office, and that isnt necessarily true. Its like when Mitt Romney challenged Obamas military strategy by pointing out that we have fewer ships (and Obama famously rebuked we also have fewer horses and bayonets). Romneys statement was factually accurate, but it was phrased to lead the audience to draw false conclusions. Politicians are *very* good at doing that."
"He didnt specifically mention inflation, it had to be inferred - thus the statement is only mostly true. The core truth its expressing - that the poor are poorer - is true, but the statement he made contained a small factual error - neglecting to mention inflation."
No its only true if you use inflation adjusted numbers instead of absolute and considering that politifact has given pants on fire to republicans for doing the same thing they have to knock it down but not as far as if it were a republican saying the exact same thing.
100% true? Using what metric? There are (and I hope you agree) multiple ways to calculate this.
"I also guessed that Politifact attempts such an equivalence when it said that Jon Stewart was lying when he claimed that Fox News viewers are the most misinformed media viewers. But when you go to all the statements theyve rated as [Pants on Fire Lies](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/rulings/pants-fire/), a majority of them are from conservatives. So Im not sure."

"RE: Bailouts - The measures in the Affordable Care Act have a more complicated sequence that include a variety of outcomes. the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the government would neither make nor lose money. [Context](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/13/charles-krauthammer/krauthammer-obamacare-has-hidden-insurance-company/) The ACA mandates you buy health insurance, because access to health care is a mandate. The current stupidly high costs of all US health care (The reason you can fly to other countries for the same surgery for 1/4 the price) is mostly due to the uninsured abusing the current system. Its just so monumentally ignorant to say Well you can *choose* not to be insured and then when that jackass lands in the hospital we all shoulder the bill. My asshole neighbor shouldnt be allowed to gamble on my insurance premium. The ACA will make the private market competitive. We dont have competition now, because its a necessity masquerading as a luxury."
Thats not what fascism means. 
The answer is a competitive private market. We dont have that. We have corporations in bed with the government (fascism) rigging markets and creating megamonopolies. Why do you think the ACA forces everyone to buy a for profit service from a private corporation? Why do you think the ACA has a built in bailout mechanism that requires the government to pay insurance companies for their losses + 3% profit? Google it. This cant possibly solve the problem because the ACA was written by the insurance companies to guarantee them clients and profits. Are you this naive about whats really happened?

And now with social media, where you can switch someone off completely with the click of a mouse it is even worse. People do not talk any longer than it takes to figure out that you disagree. Once they disagree they do not ask you to explain why you think differently. They do not explain why they think you are wrong. They clam up and unfriend you."
Or you could ask someone poor and in a red state that cant get insurance under ACA. That sword is double edged. He failed to give us single payer=he failed.
"[Obama, April 2007](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/16/barack-obama/obama-statements-single-payer-have-changed-bit/). &gt; Obama has pledged that, if elected, all Americans would have health-care coverage by the end of his first term. He has said he is reluctant to switch to a single-payer national health insurance system because of the difficulty in making a quick transition from the employer-based private system. I dont quote the earlier date because that cant really be linked to his presidential campaign promises. Ultimately this version was already on the edge of possibility, single payer was possible. He specifically indicates why. Policy makers might try it in two decades, ACA will have to settle first."

Not everyone in medicine can specialize or the system falls over. What this chart also shows is that youre overpaying with private insurance.

"Wow. Look at all the redditors questioning why someone would post a survey suggesting black fathers are involved with their kids. Heaven forbid someone posts a survey showing blacks in a positive light. One redditor suggests that the problem is because the site is called good black news. So what? Look at the freaking sources. You cant criticize a website just because of its name. They pulled this article from the LA Times. GASP! And where did they get this information? The National Center for Health Statistics. Oh my! The other redditors suggest that the article was mistaken for not including fathers who were not with their children at home. Uh. Yes they did. And I quote: &gt;Nearly half of black fathers living apart from their young children said they played with them at least several times a week, 42% said they fed or ate with them that frequently, and 41% said they bathed, diapered or helped dress them as often ? rates on par with or higher than those of other men living apart from their kids. It also says: &gt;Although the survey showed that black fathers not living at home are as involved with their children as fathers of other races in similar situations, the higher percentage of black dads absent from the home could drag down the average involvement for all black fathers, other researchers pointed out And it also went on to talked about fathers in a different relationship &gt;However, Laura Tach and fellow researchers also found that black fathers were more likely than white or Latino dads to stay close to their children after having more kids with a new partner. Because it isn?t as rare for black fathers to live away from the home Really Reddit? Every single damn time. You assume the worst in blacks. This article must surely be a fluff piece. These pro-black journalists must surely have left out blacks away from home (Hehe. Therefore the stereotype is still true in my racist mind). Surely something must be wrong with this article if it makes an assumption that makes the black community look good. Redditors assumed all of these things.

"I do not deny that he screwed up but **for most people** it remains true, as I stated."
That was true for most people even though Faux tries to make it seem typical. Those that lost theirs had plans that were deemed substandard or the providers decided to leave markets until those with preexisting conditions were already signed up with other companies. Many people with the substandard plans only found out how under covered they were when they received huge hospital bills that were not paid for by their insurance. I only found out about such plans when I was dating a woman that sold them and I discovered that they had a total payment cap of something like $20K or other loopholes hidden in the fine print. Obama should have foreseen that and provided a caveat when he made that statement.

"Reality: Orphaned pages on old campaign website finally get deleted Reddit: HES SECRETLY CHANGING HIS PROMISE ON WHISTLEBLOWERS DUE TO THE RECENT NSA CONTROVERSIES!! Also, techdirt blogspam. [Original article](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/07/25/obama-promises-disappear-from-web/) Also, Obamas campaign promises regarding whistleblowers were referring to [this](http://www.whistleblower.org/blog/42-2012/2380-president-signs-whistleblower-protection-enhancement-act-wpea-), signed into law last year."
Disappointed with our presidency. Abusing its own power and shifting the nation towards a blind future. This is not the America I have fought for.
http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130726/01200123954/obama-promise-to-protect-whistleblowers-just-disappeared-changegov.shtml Obama Promise To Protect Whistleblowers Just Disappeared From Change.gov 
obama fooled you white bitches haaah
Who would have guessed that hed turn out to be a politician. 
"Misleading title: Theyve gone in and deleted the that section, yes... and all of the other content on Change.gov since that was a transition website and its five years into his presidency."
"Another stupidly misleading title on r/politics. Are you guys capable of reading? The content that was used on change.gov, Obamas original campaign website for the 2008 election has been wiped. All sorts of campaign promises had been archived since the initial win in 2008 and the site has essentially been a link to the White House website since. However, these pages were still left up, just not immediately accessible by going to change.gov. Recently, everything that wasnt even directly accessible was erased from the page, including this bit about whistleblowers. This is probably just cleaning up an old webpage and reallocating resources, but of course there is someone out there ready to editorialize a non-story. EDIT: .gov not .org"
Promised change. Changed promise. 
"Thats a hell of a coincidence- my support of Obama disappeared, too."
All he needs to do is change the definition of whistleblower in the same way that he changed the definition of civilian in the context of drone strikes.
"&gt;Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process. To be fair, the Obama administration is doing their utmost to make sure Snowden has full access to our courts, regardless of Snowdens opinion on the matter..."
They closed change.gov and redirected to whitehouse.gov. Nothing to see. Move on.
But... Change.gov is a defunct website. Its a campaign website that hasnt been used for over 4 years. Just dissapeared goes for everything on that site. All other pages that were normally accessible by direct-url access are now gone.
"Wait, the entire website is gone. Way to cherry pick, OP"
Hope that was the change you were looking for.
Did anyone else read the actual article? The entire site was taken down not just the whistlerblower article.

"The last election was my first opportunity to vote in a presidential election, I was idealistic and optimistic. I truly believed that Obama at least was a good man, now I realize that he is a hypocritical liar. I am truly sad, I have lost nearly all faith in the government. It is horrible to see that the dream that was America ,has been reduced by corrupt politicians and political deadlock."
"While the article may very well be right about the intent, the ENTIRETY of the websites content was removed. The article makes it sound as if *just* the Project Whistleblowers portion disappeared. I think a lot of people here didnt actually read the article."
From change.gov: The transition has ended and the new administration has begun Reddits response: They took down the transition website? Thanks a lot Obama!

"Ugh...techdirt.

But, the website was still up until a month ago. The sunlight foundation, [who first noticed this](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/07/25/obama-promises-disappear-from-web/), speculated that the line about protecting whistleblowers might be the reason why.

Maybe even a 3rd term (or more) if we can get rid of that pesky 22nd Amendment.
"I wonder how the order to do this went down? Did he just plain out say, Lets take that whistleblower shit off our homepage or did he doll it up a bit? Because he doesnt need to lie to his staff, they know what hes doing and why hes doing it. Its the American people he has to lie to."

Finally - a little honesty.
"Obama - Just another Chicago politician who will say whatever you want to hear so he can get elected, but when it comes time for him to act on those promises, well .. ummm.... I mean....listen this isnt my department. Face it Obama supporters you guys got duped, and if you still think this guy is making this country better, you need to open your eyes.

His about face is infuriating. I lost all hope in politics a few months ago. Its amazing how quick you can go from idealistic to jaded.
"For the most open and transparent presidency hes really done a 180. Constant lies, breaking the law, etc. If a republican was in office, he would have been impeached. You know its true."
What decade do these people think it is? Like that could possibly go *unnoticed*. Dont they realize that removing that from the site is only going to call more attention to it? The only thing left to figure out now is whos got the balls to ask Jay Carney why Obamas promise was taken off the site. Watch him evade that shit like the fucking plague.

In order to prevent threats, including those from terrorism, we will strengthen intelligence collection to identify and interdict those who intend to do us harm.

We have always been at war with whistleblowers.
"Someone here must be within a degree of separation of Obama. I just know in my heart that, as horrible and bizarre as this looks, hes a decent guy, and smart enough to know how not to come off like Darth Vader. What the heck is going on? It feels as if theres another two or three layers of this that arent public knowledge. Im starting to feel as if the best explanation for all of this is that space aliens or the equivalent (spores?) have taken over his brain. Any explanation involving Obama ruining his image this way of his own volition seems ludicrous. "

When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building."

"&gt;Obama Change.gov website taken done because it isnt relevant anymore. I fixed that sensationalist title for you, OP. Listen, I think the demoshit/republicunt machine is just as corrupt as you do. As a matter of fact, probably more so - because I believe in crrraaaazyy tin foil conspiracies - like, for instance, I think that the government lies to us about a lot of shit, so its wise to think that they lie to us about other shit too.

color me NOT surprised
I got it: W. Bush and Cheney are whistleblowers - go get em !
Well at least theyre being honest now.
They still want to protect whistleblowers. They even give them a nice 8x10 room. With a lock on the outside. And round-the-clock security. Great protection right there.
We have always been at war with eurasia.
"I do believe romney would have done better. I cannot think of a single good decision or lack there of, the man has made. The country has NEVER been this divided. "
I never supported a politicians election bid as much as I did for Obama...and Ive never regretted supporting any politician more than I do him.
"Obama has been ruthless about persecuting whistleblowers. Its gotten so bad that he recently implemented a program called Insider Threat, where federal workers are encouraged to report co-workers who might out illegal and immoral practices by arms of the administration: http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/20/194513/obamas-crackdown-views-leaks-as.html#.UfLmzG2tGtM I voted for Obama in 08, taking his staemente about safeguarding civil liberties at face value. I have never been so disappointed by an elected official as I have him on this matter."
"Ha, does the government think that they are the only watchers? The internet is watching, and it knows if youve been bad or good."
"They deleted content that was only visible to people that still had direct links. They deleted it all, not just the whistle blower portion that this article highlights to make it mildly interesting."
Well...he did promise change.
"Well done President Obama. You got a bunch of young people interested and engaged in politics by promising and promoting change, only to turn many into cynics. I guess we misinterpreted change. We thought he meant he would change the system. What he meant was that he would change into a normal politician."

"Heh, this is a great example of the [Streisand Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) when you try to hide something, you end up exposing more attention to it."
The disgust I have felt in recent times for our government is unmatched. 
is reaping personal data from citizens really worth all this political suicide?
"Kinda sick of this whole whistle blowers thing. But Ill say this. Obama has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt. That hes just another politician. I really hope whatever party, the next president is a president of the people. All of us. Not just blacks, the rich, the poor, religious folk, everyone. "
"In regards to the NSA/Prism issue - Replace obama with any person at all, in this particular timeline, and it would still be the exact same situation. Point at him all you want, but not only is the entire federal government to blame, its also an action that was going to happen given our level of current technology. What? You actually believe for one second that this was NOT going to be a thing some day? THIS is happening. If it didnt happen in the bush years, it was going to happen in Obamas, or the 2016/2020, or later. Hell, id even bet that if the government publicly proclaimed they were shutting down the whole thing, it would still be active somewhere. Look at it from their perspective for a moment. Youre an agent, charged with tracking down terrorists, spys, etc.. This is a pretty god damn awesome tool to have at your disposal. Doesnt mean its right, but its the sheer nature of our current reality. The only thing hurting them right now, imo, is this relentless dogging for Snowden. Its pretty darn clear that they dont give two shits about getting the guy in custody... they just want to make a public lashing so all the other hired contractors think twice about stepping out of bounds. "
"Dont look at me, I voted Jill Stein..."
I couldnt come up with anything that funny myself Guys a comedian
What a complete fucking disgrace Obama is. A complete embarrassment to liberals and progressives. A slap in the face to libertarians. I cant fucking believe this guy. LIBERAL MY ASS! Obama and his administration are all corporatist pigs. BURN IN HELL! *edit* Im calm now... sorry about that... not really though.
Obama: We will have a transparent government... If it serves the poeples interest. We will protect whistleblowers... Who do not blow whistles. We will end the war in Iraq.... In due time. All two legged creatures are equal.... But some are more equal than others
"Im as disappointed in Obama as the next guy, but with all of this stuff thats come to light lately a lot of conspiracy theories sure have gained popularity. Plus greater lack of critical thinking than usual seems to have taken hold. It makes me sad to see some of the comments that are getting upvoted. If only all this anger at the status quo would lead these redditors to actually work towards fixing the system it would be worth it. Sadly it will probably just lead to Alex Jones getting more views."

"
"Seriously, downvote me if you want, but I dont even think Im going to vote anymore. Whats the point? Our system is so corrupt there is no turning back. Obama did a complete 180 on everything he promised. Id anyone thinks the powers will be reigned in, you have more hope then what I do. There is so much money now invested in the Utah center, and new centers being built, and promises made in those endeavors, I have to wonder what kind of dirt is being held over the heads of our politicians and congress. The only one that comes to mind that wants any kind of change and has stuck his neck out is Wyden. Hes my hero. Im from an older generation, when we actually went outside and protested and made change. Put technology into the mix, and all that has changed. I use to think our petitions helped. They dont. I use to get mad at people when I couldnt get them to sign petitions. Often hearing whats the point? It made my blood boil. When I would hear people say I dont vote, whats the point I would reply with if you dont vote you have no right to bitch, get out and vote. And now, Im becoming one of those very people. If anyone wants to watch a really good video of a speech Ron Paul gave, this is worth a watch, oldie, but couldnt be more true: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjuUWr9vaXo Simply titled: What If Only person I would vote for at this point would be Ron Paul. Other than that, I WILL throw my vote, or just not vote at all. Id rather not vote then vote for outright corruption. And all you haters can hate. Im only saying what some wont admit."

"OK, so if ALL the content disappears from change.gov, why not give the title about one specific promise out of hundreds? This will surely piss of reddit users, some of them wont even click on the link anyway. Feel like Im watching a negative campaign ad. Regardless Obama is unethical in the Snowden case, or not, this title is terrible really."
"I really think the only way America can make changes is by resorting to violence - kind of like how their government gets stuff done. Now dont get me wrong, I am not promoting any kind of violence. But when the population is passive and peaceful, the government doesnt listen - as we can see. Americans have been very respectful with how they have been protesting against what they do not like about their government. And the government continues to ignore them and ignore their own basic rights. Countries that have gotten so fed up with their government resort to violence to change, such as civil wars. I believe the American government is only going to think about changing how they operate if its own citizens launched some kind of civil war against the government. Because Americans can protest peacefully as much as they want but their government will never listen. Imagine if the American civil war was instead protest after protest. Nothing would have been accomplished. As sad as it sounds, it seems thats how our world works."
"Since http://www.whitehouse.gov/ is now the link givin on change.gov I left an online comment asking why obama has changed his stance on protecting whistileblowers. You should do the same, make sure to post his promise- Protect Whistleblowers: Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance.

Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process. "

the problem with the promise is people disagree what a whistleblower is 
As a Progressive i have been disappointed with Obama for several years now. Republican pundits said that in his second term he would true colors and i guess prosecuting Whistle blowers and destroying our 4th Amendment rights is the real Obama
All along the crazy people were sane and the sane people were diluted. Life is often hilarious. 
Many of his promises just disappeared into thin air. This president is just magical. Amazed yet?
They shut down the entire Change.gov site though. It now just redirects to the White House site. The headline makes it sound as if they deleted this whistleblower thing specifically.

Most of the people defending this on r/politics are probably the mindless professional drones that Jay Carney employs to try and protect the POTUS on social media websites. Im sure there is about 50 or 60 staffers on the payroll whose sole job is to troll reddit and blast propaganda and downvotes at any dissent to the holy one Obama. 
I think im more surprised this post didnt disappear from /r/politics just like every post about Zimmerman saving that family from the car wreck. 
Fuck you Obama. You two faced fuck.
President Hopenchange is just as bad as any previous president. Hes a genius for fooling so many people back in years leading up to his election.
Its like 1984 George Orwell changing what they said... Next theyll be encouraging us to doublethink everything. Which we pretty much already do now!

This headline is misleading. Its not just the promise to protect whistleblowers thats disappeared. The site has apparently been scrubbed of all content.
The Republican and Democratic parties have evolved to two sides of the same center.
"To be fair -- and Im not protecting the removal from the site -- the idea of whistle-blowing wasnt meant to be what Snowden did. Traditional whistle-blowing means taking it to the proper administrative channels to blow the whistle on a governmental unit -- not leaking it to the press for a huge shit storm. Snowden probably wouldnt get far with that, and that may be a problem, but lets not pretend that Obama -- or any President -- would support and protect this type of whistle-blowing."
"This is beyond love for Snowden and hate for Obama. This is about 47% of all U.S. workers having only part-time low-wage jobs. Riots, racial clashes, and then there will be a civil war."

"Lets face it, Obama is only starting to drop his Im going to bring change act because hes into his second and final term. The moment a politician doesnt need to worry about re-election, theyll show their true colours. Obamas true colours are that hes just like every other slimy politician. He hasnt changed jack shit."
"Hopefully this will get buried but I absolutely hate how people are reacting to this issue. Yes, the US violated our rights, yes something should be done about it. Snowden knew what he was doing when he blew that whistle, he knew he would be deemed a traitor and rightfully so because. . .well he is one. He needs to be brought back tot he US so we can demonstrate we know how to deal with people like this in a humane manner. The only reason Russia is doing what they are doing is because it will make us look worse if we cant get him back on US soil and deal with him in a democratic fashion and make this go away. Our image is being soiled and the ignorant American populous are the catalysts. "

How could Obama turn out to be such shit.... so disappointing. 
"Well, he wanted to work on his legacy. This is a good start. I think as far back as President Carter, the voters knew what they were getting with their presidential choices and each one turned out to be pretty much as expected -- until now."
I think its because /r/politics is no longer a default sub. Everyones front page looks different based on what you are subscribed to. Go manage your subs and you can create a front page that is customized to you.
Why is this the top up upvoted post but it is not on the front page?
Like something out of 1984! Rewriting History! Obama is getting really scary!
I am making a graphic with before and after for this.. however could use help. Does anyone see on the whitehouse.gov site a reference to whistle blowers? Or rather an ethics agenda? I found the http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/ethics/ page however it is not totally comparative. I want to find a place that shows that the moved content does no longer include the whistle blowers protection. 
Hypocritical statements and downright lies in politics?? WHAT?!?
Shameful
"Well... He meant the Oooother wistleblowers, the ones that will blow the wistle on some tax avioding companies, not the government itself, poor guy :)"
/r/conspiracy just shat themselves.
This is so depressing..
Unfortunately its taken things like this for Obama to reveal his true colors to people but this doesnt surprise me. Leaking corruption and the privacy invasion of a vast majority of the American population is the duty of a good citizen... shame the government cares more about itself than its people.
Yall should watch the wire. Especially season 3-5. This is standard 
I just saw a sign at my company that says whistleblowers are protected. So my company is better than the gov?
Oh man please do a new AMA.
"Obama -second most disappointing president in US history? (for clarity, by disappointment I mean a disparity between what we expected and what we got)"
Biased much? I like how pulling **all the content** turns into a story how an old campaign website removed only the section about protecting whistleblowers.
Change we can no longer find on the webpage.
Cant claim the Rosranne Rossanna Danna exemption on this one. Say it aint so Mr. President.....
WOAH. So a Chicago politician with no record who ran on grandiose promises turned out to be a totally corrupt federal yes-man?! Color me surprised. Reddit deserves Obama.

"This is another reason I think Chris Christie is our next president. He has been almost in lockstep with this administration on this issue, and although its not much, that may just be enough to grab the swing voters he needs..."
"Do an AMA now, Obama. I dare you."
"Good guy Obama, promised a change, changed EVERYTHING."
Changing promises was not what I thought that whole Change thing was about.
"Well, he did promise change."
People believed him to begin with? Thats cute.
I am computer illiterate so can someone tell me why when I try to go to change.gov it does not exist? 404?
The article just says he removed all his campaign material from change.org his campaign site. DONT TELL ME TO READ THE ARTICLE I DONT HAVE TO READ ANYTHING AMERICA SUXX 
So glad I voted for the Libertarian Party last year....
Can we bombard the White House with emails expressing disappointment?
"And he noticed, in fresh white paint, the phrase but some animals are more equal than others. And he thought it must have always been there"
I feel ashamed that I was an early Obama fanatic.
"Time for another AMA, Obama."
"Down vote me, but its true... Hows that hopey changey thing workin out for ya?"
This shit is getting ridiculous.
Meet the old boss Same as the new boss
"I love how its a total 360 now and everyone sees Obama as the worst president of all time, as if the alternatives would have been any better, Mccain? Romney? Yeah I dont think so, oh and lets not forget about the 8yr clusterfuck that was the culmination of the Bush/Cheney regime. Face it people all politicians are liars and scumbags who could give a shit about you, its what theyre paid to do...welcome to reality."

What do you expect? He promised change so he changed his promise.

Cant hide shit from the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20130425082834/http://change.gov/agenda/ethics_agenda/)! Its a few paragraphs from the bottom.
OBAMA is the biggest liar ever. Listening to him is like playing the opposite game with kids. You can keep your health insurance yeah right. ... Blah blah blah.. The best part is the people that actually voted for this idiot are the ones he is hurting the most. To those who say George Bush lied I say to you that President Obama is George Bush on Steroids. Hows that change working for everyone? Suckers.... 
I am certain NSA has a backup copy
Maybe that is why it is called change.gov
Ouch! I guess they only wanted to protect whistle-blowers that explicitly support their personal brand of propaganda. Faith in the fed at an all time low!
Well thats... disappointing. 
How is this any different than the other hypocrisies in the government? Obama is no different people. Wake up. Obamacare for the people. Except congress. Insider trading? Jail. Except congress. Normal people whistleblow. Waterboarding. Obama? Backslaps from Israel. 
Obama may be Nostradamus third anti-christ.
But but but he was a liberal!!! He was literally Jesus!!!
He did made some changes but they werent good.
Obamas the worst!
Now that IS change I can believe in
Classic Obama. 
Found this on Whitehouse.gov (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/ppd-19.pdf)
Im very disappointed in Obama. I still feel he would have been the lesser of two evils as I highly doubt Romney would have been a better president.
"Became a bit inconvenient, I guess. Obama voters -- sorry yet? "
Its funny how reddit was praising Obama months ago (not that mitt would have been any better). Looks like we came to our senses.

For the next election, let us ALL do our research and vote for those who come from humble backgrounds, have real and viable plans, and would make sense for this country. Avoid strictly Democrats and Republicans if possible.

Chocolate rations have been increased to 25!
"Were only 6 months in to his second term, buckle up folks, this is going to be a rough ride."
I would just like to say. INB4 some fucking excuse about it being removed and some bullshit story about how its in our best interests to follow the law with regards to the safeguards put in place for proper whistle-blowing and we welcome open discussions. 
Is anyone really surprised by this? All most all politicians are crooked. Its funny to see those who bought the lie both times finally coming to terms with their savior. Keep believing everything mainstream media feeds you. All I can do is shake my head at the people who are so shocked by this lack of integrity. Wake up people. 
Oh....another lie.
I was reading an article not that long ago that said more whistleblowers and informants have been prosecuted under Obama than W by a large margin. Not a fan of donkeys or elephants FYI.
Obama got put in to ensure a revolution didnt take place.
"Can anyone explain this? Dr. Ellsbergs book, ?Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers,? has become a bestseller. In a quote on the back cover, Senator John F. Kerry wrote, ?Daniel Ellsberg demonstrated enormous courage during a difficult and turbulent time in America?s history, courage which undoubtedly saved American lives on the battlefield and helped to hold politicians accountable for mistakes they refused to admit. His story reminds us that to fulfill the responsibilities of citizenship is to always ask questions and demand the truth.? "
Well at least we got to hope for change for a little while.
"More evidence of a government coup detat. Obamas ideals when elected into office have been crushed by an office superior to the US presidency. Welcome to a new era, ladies and gentlemen. The last shred of hope our government might have had is dead. Until the second revolutionary war."
To be fair guys Obama probably just forgot he said to protect whistleblowers and then when he remembered he figured he better take it down cause he had already forgot to do so.
"Dont they know that once on the internet, always on the internet. Not exactly a secret now."
Thats why its called **change**.gov.
Disappointment in Obama is simply an acknowledgement of where the real power lies. 
"How in the hell does this have 32,000 downvotes? "
"I pushed for him...I suspected the nsa of being the schizio side of the gov, so i was not surprised about all their spying. Prove its fucking worth it and/or shit down oil and push for shit that will benefit us for the longterm. Not that i expect to have children ,but show that u have a bright and lasting future for our country and I will have your back."
"So, in other words, Shut up, slave!"
And not a single journalist with balls has asked him about his dramatic platform reversal.
It seems like this was a deliberate attempt to use his movement to encourage potential whistleblowers to come out for the inevitable crackdown. I dont think its a coincidence he is so open about it now that hes in his second term and not up for re-election.
"**Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government.** AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. WHAT AN ASSHOLE!"

"I have given 1 year, 2 months to this company. I make around 800 a month, and I do use food stamps. I get $200 a month for my wife and I, I have been a Dry grocery associate for this time.. I have some grief to share, and also some suggestions on how to survive being a wal-mart associate. My grievances: 1.) Management focusing on pety stuff- For instance; When I was evaluated I was not given a raise. This was at my one year mark, I make 8.10 an hour and I work my ass off. I did not receive a raise, because I had One write up for working over 6 hours (Thats right folks, trying to help out and be a good worker) and my attendance (I currently have 2 absent days) 2.) Not truely being customer oriented; I am consistently harassed by management to perform (Move freight weight, they could care less about the customers) They see you helping a customer, automatically assuming your standing around talking, or when you are walking to check something for them, youre automatically put on the shit list for not working. Its absurd. 3.) Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. I will have more people telling me what to do then I can count, and they wonder why xy and z is not done. 4.) Asking you to do a job that the wage is higher than what you make; Odds are, you will be sent to do someone elses job. Odds are, they get paid more than you; 5.) They are not in the business of human progression; rather profit over people. Remember that its just a walmart, if you work there. Try your best, but dont let them take advantage (They are in the business of taking advantage!!) Guide for surviving as a wal-mart associate 1.) Remember, its a walmart. 2.) Treat your customers with compassion, and empathy. Put yourself in there shoes, and remember there negativity isnt directed at you; even if it seems that way. Treat them almost as if they were your family; after all, we are all human beings on the same planet. 3.) Dont be late/call in unless you cannot control it. Punctuality is everything. 4.) Try your best to communicate the situations that you need assistance on. Otherwise, management cant help you. 5.) When people are trying to pass you, let them pass. Youre getting paid, be courteous, even if you have a time limit. 6.) Regardless of what your doing, always approach a customer and ask if they need assistance. It will pass time and create a positive environment, and they will tell management. Management hears bitching all day, so to hear something good, is truely meaningful. 7.) Invest in a higher education while youre employed at wal-mart 8.) Use your time you must work to learn about people; and to handle conflicts. I try to be the best human being I possibly can be while working at walmart. Management can get under your skin, but remember they are just human too, and probably not as content as you are. Thankyou- Jayson"
"I really dont like this sort of dodgy accounting. The headline is downright dishonest, and relies on some heavily cherry-picked facts."
(Insert Restaurant Name) Relies on Tips to Subsidize Low Wages
"The only way to actually hurt Wal-Mart is to stop shopping there. And I can almost guarantee that, for a massive number of people, this isnt going to happen any time soon."
"Taxpayers rely on walmart to subsidize chronic unemployment, low wages, and rising cost of food and housing. Hows this any different? "
"*Shrug* One wonders why the study made the assumption that every single person working at every single Walmart store would be on public assistance. Surely, if that were the case, it would be reported by more than a union-backed study, right? I mean, really, every single worker at every single store on welfare? That IS what the article says, guys. They specifically arrived at their figures by first assuming that every single person at every single store that works for Walmart is on public assistance. No matter how much you hate Wally World, even the mildest application of common sense must show that to be complete horsecrap. Of course, now Ill get a parade of downvotes, and accusations that Im trying to argue that Walmart pays its workers in thousand-pound chunks of pure gold, or some such nonsense, but that doesnt actually make me wrong. You guys can hate on walmart as much as you want, but any study that makes the assumption that ANYTHING is 100% homogeneous is deeply and obviously flawed."
"&gt; costing taxpayers as much as $900,0000 at just one Wal-Mart Supercenter in Wisconsin. Nine hundred ten thousand dollars!"
"Oh I can validate many of these stories. I just left Walmart after 15 years, I was a manager for 10 of them. I could tell you stories youd never believe. They lie, cheat and steal every day. But I have only seen this in the last 3 or so years, it has changed... Im in Philly Pa area. Ive seen store managers change times in associates worked hours, Ive seen store and shift managers change associate passwords to do their cbls or delete cbls so they stayed off regional lists, Ive watched store, shift and market asset protection managers hold associates accountable for making mistakes... Using the deleted or store manager completed cbls as proof of training ( associates didnt know their cbls were completed) Ive seen store, shift, market and other assistant managers refuse associates ability to report accidents (one was a broken arm) Ive seen said managers pad inventory, throw away merchandise and take rounded off markdowns instead of prepping merchandise for inventory, Ive seen sexual harassment, discrimination of race and gender, Ive seen schedules changed with no notice, hours cut to save bonuses etc. I reported a long list of things about 3 years ago to a market asset protection manager I thought I could trust to do something. Turns out she was signing reports without reading them and allowing these things to occur because she couldnt afford another store to shrink. So instead of doing the right thing they spent 3 years trying to fire me.. They threw me on 3rd. My boss would give me notes then call me and change verbally so it wasnt in writing. He would tell me to do unethical things like assign tasks to myself and complete them in the system to make it look like we had enough associates to home office, hed tell me to basically erase our ims ( picks) instead if wasting time to pull them to keep scores up, or schedule people in job codes they werent going to work (different pay scales) just to make it look like we had associates to HO. When I refused they would look for things they could coach me on since they obliviously couldnt coach me fit the true things. I had a baby and my store, market hr and market manger kept talking to me about bring a stat at home mom, told me anything over my scheduled hours was volunteer work (pa law says if youre salary but strictly in a role of supervising people which was my role you are to be paid overtime). This used to be the greatest company. I called it the best kept secret because I was making extremely good money and my job wasnt hard... That is until they decided the illegal way was much more profitable and exploiting the associates who NEED their jobs. "
http://www.businessinsider.com/wal-mart-relies-on-taxpayers-to-subsidize-low-wages-2013-6 Wal-Mart Relies On Taxpayers To Subsidize Low Wages 
"I have been saying this for years. I think any company that employs someone for 20+ hours per week and doesnt pay them enough to live on should have to pay taxes equal to 110% of the government assistance that person receives in Food Stamps, WIC, Welfare, and Medicaid. This way the price is reflected in the price of the goods, rather than our taxes."
"My daughter worked for Wal Mart for almost 6 months. She was always scheduled to work 30 hrs or less per week. After she had worked there for a while ( couple of months) the pressure to stay late and donate her time because they were busy happened almost every day. After she refused a few times, a supervisor had the talk with her. If she wanted to become an associate, if she wanted to continue working there, if she wanted to be part of the team she needed to start acting like she wanted to work there. It must be corporate policy to treat the workers like that. And, that is why I have not set foot in a Wal Mart for 15 years and will never do so again."
"If you are against this and refuse to shop at walmart you should not shop at almost every other retailer or eat at any restaurant or get gas at any gas station. All of these places pay poverty wages. Walmart may be the biggest example, but it is just doing what everyone else is. In fact, Walmart paid me more than both Mcdonals and Target did. "
"This information isnt new -- most of it has been around in the public sphere for at least 8 years (excepting the exact Wisconsin numbers) Check out the 2005 documentary Wal Mart: The High Cost of Low Price, from 2005. If you have Netflix, it can be streamed. Problems detailed in the film: employees reliance on public assistance, forced unpaid overtime, skeleton crews, environmental hazards, the forced closure of longstanding local businesses, an anti-union stance, cameras to spy on employees, part-time hours, lack of security on Wal-mart grounds, and deplorable conditions in oversea factories."
"I remember how Wal-Mart made a girl come into work the next day after she had broken her leg. They had her stocking in a wheelchair. There was also a guy who had an injury, and they made him come back to give them a form after he saw the doctor... Or they would have been fined by WCB or something. They couldnt just let the guy go home after seeing the doctor. Ridiculous."

"Walmart cashier here that feels like killing himself daily due to the shitty situation I am in. I work 32-33 hours a week. They dont let people work more than that usually because they would be forced to pay them benefits. I make 7.90 an hour. We are told we will get bonuses 2-4 times a year, but each time that has happened there is always something that comes up that takes it away. If a customer decides to lie and say they were hurt in our store, our bonus is gone. The highest bonus that Ive been given is $70, when usually they say it will be around $400. My monthly income is about $700-800 dollars. That isnt enough to afford an apartment/food/basic necessities (tp,soap,personal hygiene stuff, etc). Because of that, I was forced to get on foodstamps to be able to afford to eat. I tried getting on medicaid for health insurance too, as I suffer from ADHD that makes it difficult to function day to day without my meds. Of course I was denied because I wasnt stupid enough to have a kid at my age. Ive been off my meds for about a year and ever day is a nightmare. My town is also too small to have any free clinics or anything, so that is out of the question. Eventually I gave up on trying. I live in my car now and still work for walmart. Im hoping this will let me save up enough money to move somewhere with better job opportunities, but Im really at a dead end. I dread going to work and having to put on a facade that Im happy working for such a great corporation as walmart, but if people knew the shit that goes on behind the scenes, they would be appalled to give walmart their money. Oh, and when you are hired on and havent worked there for more than six months, you dont get ANY bonuses or any time and a half pay for working holidays. Also, we dont have vacation time or anything like that. In fact, I was just talking to a coworker who was denied both of their childrens birthdays off, even though they asked 3 months in advance."
It seems to me that they are exploiting a hole in our social safety net. I like to focus on things other than the minimum wage but this is a weird situation that needs fixing. What is actually happening here is that welfare is putting downward pressure on peoples reservation wage. Since people are receiving government money for making so little income but still working then it lowers their reservation wage. Minimum wage should be raised to the point where someone working at it for some reasonable amount of hours (75% fulltime) would not need/qualify for welfare. edit: Damn the incentives going on here are super interesting.
Money controls the money that controls politics
"All someone has to do if they dont like Walmart is to not shop there, thats all it takes I havent shopped at Walmart for close to 4 years. Their customer service sucks and I rather pay a few cents more and have someone actually be able to help me, so now I just shop at Target. Fun fact: They give new hires documents to sign up for food stamps and medicaid when they are hired on then give employees a discount to shop there."
How much does Wal Mart pay in taxes?
I laugh at these posts. You all focus on Walmart while ignoring every other business that does exactly the same thing.
"Ok well, lets do this... how about we all pull together and really show walmart who is the real boss? How about non of us shop there for a whole month. NOT ONE PERSON GOING INTO ANY OF THESE WALMART STORES FOR A MONTH. But that wont happen, wont it. So walmart will continue their strategy and win. Walmart gets away with it because people are willing to allow this to happen, theres always someone more desperate to take on the crappy job. "
So are we supposed to start tipping cashiers now?
"This isnt really New news, but I think it needs to be repeated as loudly as possible, as often as possible."
"They are a job creator yea, if being on welfare is a job"
"Consider this, if we really wanted to kill walmart. . .make them pay a surcharge road tax for all those semis rolling around the country arguably using more of the roads than 2 axle cars. It would mean all of their unethical practices would be cancelled out, they would have to raise prices and then go out of business."
It is not Walmarts fault. They are within the law. Raise minimum wage for large companies if you want to see things change.
"Wally world is a bad company by anyones standards but they are not the only ones. If you live in a right to work state and you go to a restaurant, the wait staff are making $2.15/hr if they are lucky. Since most people dont realize this they dont tip very well, add the wonderful economy and you have a whole industry that employs people who cannot make minimum wage. The employer is required to cover the balance yes, but that is just to get them to minimum wage if they dont on tips. Then you add the Obamacare mandate and a lot of these places are cutting back shifts to keep hours below the minimum requirement. I know six people who have lost jobs or hours for this reason, my wife got her hours cut in half. "

"I think title here, that Wal-Mart relies on taxpayers to subsidize low wages, along with the article, is somewhat misleading. When I read the title, it made we think the government was directly giving to Wal-Mart for something. But all the article really says is, some Wal-Mart employees have low enough income to qualify for government benefits. Lets pretend that everyone who qualifies is getting every benefit they possibly could, and add up the number! "

"No. Just because Jane Doe decides to have 10 children while not building any discernible skills in life does not mean that walmart is taking advantage of anyone. These wages are not designed to support kids and a family. They are designed to pay for a high school kids car, or tuition at a community college, or to fill in the gaps for a family whose children have to work. Just because you have no other skills and are incapable of getting other work does not mean that walmart should be required to pay for all 10 of your irresponsible fucks."

"So they are paying their workers minimum wage. How is this an issue? If they arent hiring full-time workers, that doesnt mean they are depending on govt to subsidize wages. They arent paying for hours that the workers arent working. This same thing happens at any place that hires part-time workers. The people that work there, work there for a reason. They cant get a better job."
this has really nothing to do with walmart but rather the goverment inability to reign in these companies and impose higher wages. 
"While everyone is in here jerking about how bad Wal-Mart is, remember one thing: A lot of the people who work for Wal-Mart wouldnt have a job at all if it wasnt for Wal-Mart and they would be costing taxpayers even more money than they do now."
"Title could easily be U.S. Government Relies on Wal-Mart to Reduce Government Subsidies to their Employees, Who Would Otherwise Be Unemployed"
Where do you think the money is going to come from after you raise everyones wages to the point no one is on welfare?
New energy source discovered. A generator attached to Sam Waltons casket could generate Megawatts from his spinning corpse. If he only lived long enough to see the monster he created.
nothing will be done by anyone.
"WalMart is a damn good job to have...in Europe. They offer insurance, vacation, and all that...in Europe."
"&gt; ...offering wages that *force its workers* to take advantage of public-assistance programs. The wage a company offers is not coercion. There is no force applied here. The low wage may be acceptable as a stop-gap measure in order to avoid homelessness, but it is not a permanent employment solution. Wage is a contract between a company and an individual. The individual is at fault, not the company, if the wage is insufficient to meet the needs of the individual. Stop playing the blame game. There are plenty of skilled trades in the marketplace. Utilize choice. Choose to educate yourself. Choose a skilled trade. Dont choose a wage slave, dead end, job."
"Wal mart employees are some of the most depressing people Ive ever seen. You can tell that they hate every waking moment of their day and are just counting down the seconds until their shift is over. Its pretty obvious that they are doing the absolute bare minimum in order to not get fired. Contrast that to costco workers who are actually trying, seem motivated, and look like they actually give a shit about their job and dont just mope around until their shift is done."
"During the next election, do not forget Hillary Clinton was a walmart board member for [6 years](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/us/politics/20walmart.html?pagewanted=all)."
"When did it become necessary for a corporation to be held morally accountable for their employees well being when they are already complying with labor laws? The corporation and not the government decides the value of their employees and compensates them accordingly. In retail and other high turnover employers such as fast food that means minimum wage, mainly part time employment, and not much discernible career growth. If you have no real skills then unfortunately you might have to work 2 or 3 part time jobs to cobble together enough to get by. Some of us have had to work both a full time and a part time job just to make ends meet and it eventually led to better things because you can be rewarded for being ambitious. One last thing: stop having children if youre not able to support them. I seriously cannot emphasize that enough because your personal choices have absolutely zero bearing on how much money you deserve to earn!"
"Here is my insider opinion. I started working at Walmart (and yes, it is no longer Wal-Mart, just Walmart) when I was 16 as a cashier. I still work there 3 years later as a sales associate in the summer while I go to school the rest of the year. I am not bothered by the fact that most people here work at close to minimum wage. The simple fact is that we work unskilled jobs and should not be payed more. I make about $9 an hour now, and I get a quarterly bonus of about $250 before taxes, which is a lot more then I could at a comparable job at a grocery store. I get scheduled to work 30-33 hours a week, but they allow me to work unfilled shifts, so I actually work 37-40 hours a week. Walmart has recently vowed to be more transparent with employees about open shifts that we can ask to work, and they are always happy to allow me to work more. The bottom line is that Walmart workers are payed poorly because anyone with a middle school education can work these jobs. Also, I have never been treated poorly or unfairly, and I work at a smallish Walmart in an Upper-middle class suburb, so not that many crazies shop at my store."
Restaurants relies on customers to footing the bill for workers that are essentially in the poverty ranks and working at that wage.
Eliminate the subsidies so Wal-Mart cant use them.
"Why would anyone expect to be able to have a secure life let alone support a family while working *at a fucking grocery store??* These are jobs for teenagers and college kids, not fucking adults with children and a house payment... How much do you think a fucking cashier or someone who stocks items on shelves *should* make? It isnt skilled labor, it isnt hard, literally anyone who isnt physically disabled and not severely mentally disabled could do it, so why in the fuck *would* wages be anything that someone could support themselves comfortably on?"
"Someone else posted somewhere this question, and I want to see a true answer. So for all the teenage cart pushers, newly hired cashiers, and stockmen, how much do you THINK they should be earning? Just because a place hires associates doing minimal skill jobs and paying them just above minimum wage does not make them evil. Its common sense. And we dont know each associates story. Walmart may have been their last chance for a job, when no other company would hire them. Yes, they start at the bottom, but do you think a cashier should be making $20 an hour with a full time position right at the get go? What if that cashier remains a cashier for 10 years, without any personal motivation to move up in the company? Should they be making the same amount as a manager with goals of moving up? Ill tell you my quick story. I have worked at Walmart since I was 18. I worked their for 2 years but I quit, because I was unhappy with my job. Management was shit and wasnt happy about it. I got hired at Circuit City but was there when that shut down. Went about 2 months of being unemployed, applying like crazy to every retail place I could apply for. No one was hiring, or wanted to hire. Applied for unemployment, was DENIED because I was going to school, to better myself. I reapplied to Walmart as a last resort, and not even a week later they hired me back. And even though they put me in the furniture department, they paid me about a $1 more than the minimum wage. I was excited. But, over the next 2 years I was unhappy because management was treating me unfairly. So instead of quitting again, I transfered to a different store. That last manager was quickly demoted about a few months after I left, and I found an opportunity in the optics department. I went from being a garden associate to an optician without any prior training, because I wanted to better myself in the company. I even got one of my optical licenses, which bumped my pay about $5. One of Walmarts rules is that you have to be employed for over 2 years as a part time associate before they give you benefits. I pay less than $15 for my health insurance each paycheck, and my copay is less than $10 for any medical expenses. I make a decent wage, and I have been happy with the company. But I strived to be a better associate, and to better myself, because I wanted MORE pay and MORE benefits. So I ask you again, how much should a cashier with no prior training and no motivation to move up in the world, or someone doing a base skill job, how much should they be getting paid? "
Completely agree- end all taxpayers subsidies now. That will show those evil Walmart fat cats. 
every penny paid in government assistance to employees ask a result of low wages shouldn be taken back out of the companies profits at the end of the year.
common knowledge...
So what Im hearing is we need to get rid of these social support programs. Problem solved.
"The no ones forcing them to work there libertardian dipshits in this thread clearly dont understand what Walmart does to small businesses in rural and suburban towns. No ones forcing them to work there, but its often that or nothing. The very least Walmart could do for the people breaking their backs for them is pay them a decent wage."
"The title makes it seem like Wal-Mart is using tax payer money to pay their employees. If you are working at Wal-Mart and dont like your situation in life, do something to improve it instead of relying on tax payers to pay for you. Do you honestly expect to make a good living working at Wal-Mart? Why not try McDonalds or Taco Bell too?"
"Go work somewhere else, and if you dont have the skills to do that, then you are being paid what your skill set is worth. "
"Walmart pays their workers more than minimum wage. So if Walmart is a drain on the government, all minimum wage jobs are a drain. As someone who worked at minimum wage jobs and had friends who also worked at minimum wage jobs (including Walmart), they all do the same shit. We all complained about the same things and you wouldnt know we all worked at different places until we told you. I dont know anyone working for minimum wage (or close to it) in America that is satisfied with their working conditions and company policies. This isnt a Walmart problem, its much bigger than that. "
"&gt; $900,0000 Nine hundred ten thousand dollars?"
"Im a bit surprised at the reaction to this on here. I dont think Walmart is evil or anything, just trying to make some money, but you can certainly make the argument that they are largely to blame for local business going away and causing manufacturing to largely leave the US and go over seas so they can offer cheaper prices. Those 2 types of middle class jobs dont really exist anymore in the US and used to be big middle class jobs. Working at Walmart/fastfood etc... is the only work available to many people right now so if you have a family to support you might have no choice but to work there. "
"You know that line from Apples CEO about, if you want us to pay more taxes, then change the law? Well that applies to this sort of thing, too. Loopholes *can* be closed. Hypothetically speaking, that is. Not by the corrupt whores in Congress, but then could theoretically be changed."
This is one of many reasons I havent shopped at Walmart for over 6 years
"They cant be happy with a job. No, they want as much as a skilled laborer. What shit. "
"A company is responsible for maximising shareholders returns, and with the amount of unemployment in the US and the type of unskilled labour that Walmart is after, there is no incentive for them to pay their employees more than they have to. Its the same with taxes; the publicly listed companies cannot be expected to turn up to the AGM and tell their investors that they decided to write a bigger tax cheque to the government than they had to, rather than use everything possible to minimise it. You need to fix the system through regulation. tl;dr: Dont hate the player, hate the game."
"And it gets better, with all that cost savings they get to offer lower prices to the taxpayers. And if they didnt, K Mart would. You gotta love competition."
And yet nothing is ever done about Wal-Marts abuse of its workers. Too big to fail becomes too big to prosecute.
"I am bringing home more now, working *part-time* at Best Buy than I was working 40+ hour weeks at Walmart. In fact, after two years at Walmart, I was still only making $7.95/hr. And that was after 2 raises. Best Buy started me at $9/hr. Fuck Walmart."
Daily kos ran an article just like this.
"For all of the hate walmart gets on this site, most of the posts about walmart on reddit are from most users who are/were shopping there. The easiest way to force them to stop this shit is to simply not shop there. "
Can anyone figure out how much of a public subsidy we have given Walmart in total?
Disney also puts this burden on taxpayers.
Its not just Wal-mart that does this. All the major retail chains do the exact same bullshit. Youre just trying to make yourself feel superior if you have ever said I wont shop and such and such because...
Greed has won. Makes me sad. 
Shocking news: Walmart sucks.
"Im pretty liberal when it comes to social and economic policy, but after working for an Amazon Vendor and seeing how the warehouse employees were treated I took a long hard look at my views on minimum wage laws and government assistance. Seeing firsthand how government assistance, when coupled with minimum wage laws, simply maintains the socioeconomic status quo I cant help but think that a total abolishment of the minimum wage and federal assistance would result in a lot of CEO and Manager heads being put up on spikes. Maybe if all the safeguards were taken away wed see the massive upheaval the system really needs."
What the fuck is wal mart? Never heard of it...
"&gt; costing taxpayers as much as $900,0000 at just one Wal-Mart Supercenter You lost me at $900,0000. Edit: Im a copy editor who is losing his job because all copy editing is being shipped to regional hubs. The company needs to save money. My company, [redacted] gave our CEO a $250 million bonus and the equivalent in stock options for refinancing the company debt to bring us out of bankruptcy. Our CEO is the one who put us in bankruptcy. What Im trying to say is: We need copy editors./rant"
"Ill never forget an interview I saw where some lady was complaining that she couldnt feed her 5 kids on $11 an hour. Its not Walmarts fault you had 5 kids. I also dont understand why Walmart is being attacked alone. Most large retailers have the same problems. I got paid more at my job at Walmart and got larger raises than I get at my current retail job. Walmart has shit business ethics, but the wages and benefits are average at worse. "
"Yes, and lets keep blaming Wal-Mart. Who did Reddit think was to blame when lawmakers got upset over Apple taking advantage of something the government implemented? Lets be consistent here."
"The problem isnt Wal-Mart, its the subsidization. At least, that is the only thing we can control."
"Wal-Mart relies on minimum wage (just like every other company), yet is just a few companies that shows that minimum wage is not enough to their own employees, so they show their own employees how to get help from their own government that hinders them. MINIMUM WAGE IS JUST THAT! EVERY OTHER COMPANY USES IT. Yes, there are horror stories from people but from a company that employees so many, shit is going to happen. I am NOT an employee of WAL-MART, never have been. BUT, I AM an employee of retail and this is how shit works... PERIOD. Hate Wal-Mart all you want but everywhere from your local Mom-and-Pop too ... well Wal-Mart shares the EXACT same principles. Just saying. This is how it works. Dont be shocked. Want Doritos for $1.49 a bag? This is how it works. The top comments mention skeleton crews... This is how retail works. I DONT UNDERSTAND how people think retail is a magical job that pays 50k a year to sell stuff under market price. Do you Donate your time? Work for free? And do it... not get paid. You are stupid. Get a lawyer. Get paid. Simple. Heck the company I work for. If you take a dump on the cash register and get fired, if you threaten to sue... you will get a check. I dont get it. "
I dont really see the problem here. This is straight up capitalism.
Seems to be a lot of Wal-Mart shills posting here. 
"$900,0000 thats a lot of money :("
"Yup, pay workers low wages, then those workers need assistance because they make low wages. Now the taxpayer dollar goes to work to pay for the various and much needed social service programs. It sucks to be working poor."
bs article
"Um, duh. Lets put it as simply as possible: Any form of minimum wage absolutely HAS to be tied to cost of living index for your area or it will be almost useless after a short period of time."
"If it is at ALL possible for you to do so, please do NOT work at Wal-Mart. Thats the only solution to this problem."
"Sorry to shit on the circlejerk, but I work at Wal Mart in Canada and its a pretty decent job. Ive never seen a manager ask someone to stay late without pay, and Ive never seen someone punished for not doing unreasonable amounts of work. Honestly I see many people do a shitty job and then a manager shows them how to improve rather than writing them up or firing them. People are given tons of chances. Maybe its different in the US, but I suspect that a lot of the horror stories you hear are coming from a loud minority."
"Yeah, when you are trying to be the lowest in prices and minimum wage is a joke.... this is a no shit type of thing. "
Welcome to the land of obvious.
"Hey guys, lets blame Wal-Mart, not the government that makes this possible! /r/politics blind idiots"
"To all of you saying stop shopping at Wal-mart, that sounds good, but its really not that simple. There are several towns where Wal-mart is the only place that you can buy a needed item or buy your groceries in one trip. My uncle lives in a small NM mining town where a Wal-mart came along a few years ago and put several smaller local stores out of business. Now everyone in this town does the bulk of their shopping at Wal-mart. Its easy to sit on your suburban perch and say people should shop ethically, but in a tiny, isolated town where most people are not highly educated, seeking out Wal-mart alternatives is not going to be on these peoples radar. Its not realistic or fair to put the onus on them. "
"A friend of mine has worked at walmart on and off for about 12 years. As a single mom she has raised her child with, had quite a few surgeries. And rarely needed anything more then a roommate, some times she had one and things were easier, sometime she didnt and got by fine. She always worked full time there unless she chose to work lighter for a while. This is in souther California. I dont know where all the crappy walmarts are but its not any of the 4 she has worked at around here."
"Its so lazy to blame Wal-Mart for their employees not being able to make enough income to match their expenses. Is it Wal-Marts fault when a woman has a kid outside of marriage and has to live off one income? Is it Wal-Marts fault when the twentysomething has to go on food stamps while paying monthly fees for cable, Xbox, an expensive smart phone, etc? "
The monetary system is broken.
"hey just like every minimum wage paying company does. what do you think welfare is? or any government financial support program... or tipping at restaurants... its the rich forcing the middle class to pay for the people they dont pay enough to live. We wouldnt need any of those programs if we forced employers to pay people livable wages. oh, well technically if youre alive its a livable wage fuck you."
Walmart is one word
"Am I wrong to believe that a businesss goal is to make money by whatever legal means it can? I mean, sure, low wages and not allowing full time hours is shitty, but the company is profitable. And in the end, its all about profit for the business owner(s). The goal of a business is money for service or product, not employment opportunities for workers, that is a side effect."
"[heres a novel based on Walmart taking over America](http://www.amazon.com/Supercenter-Jason-Rizos/dp/0982280963/ref=la_B006FO3LSS_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370150015&amp;sr=1-1) Kind of relevant, if you think its going to keep getting worse."

TIL I hate Wal Mart more than I already did previously.
"I would just like to remind you all that walmart Canada is very different. My girlfriend and I have worked at 2 stores, and a couple friends have worked at a couple other stores and we all enjoyed it. The managers are friendly and accommodating, always trying to help you learn and make sure you are working the hours you want to. Further, they do an incredible amount for charity, locally, provincially and nationally. Hell, Im watching the BC childrens hospital telethon and just watched my old boss give a giant $900,000 cheque as well as organizing a huge walk for them in Vancouver. Yes they pay low wages to the entry level and lower management positions, but they will really push you to advance if you show the initiative and have good work ethic. I worked there for 5 years, mostly while in high school and was told if I didnt want to go off to University my manager would put my name in to get trained as an assistant manager starting at $50-$55k/year (at 21 years old with just a high school education). I see so much hate for Wal Mart, but their Canadian side is actually a very good company. "
"I worked for walmart for a while and never had any real problems, it was smy first job ever and I started out with $8.75/hr, I cant complain in the slightest. "
No fucking shit. Now how do we make laws that simultaneously make it worse for the workers while making it easier for the companies to continue to do this shit?
"It is bull shit they encourage workers to get on food stamps, fucks up the economics of the marketplace. "
"Oh, government is the problem? Where are the liberals now, eh?"
Why is this the companies fault? The tax law allows it. You dont like it? Change it.
Not to be mean but I work at Costco and it is awesome!!!!
This story has been told for over 10 years. Are people going to act accordingly?
"Why is this even a bad thing? The alternative is that we double minimum wage, resulting in minimum wage jobs being cut in half. We end up with half as many people receiving government benefits, but they need twice as much money to live."
"Ive been working within the electronics department of my local Wal-mart for the past 7 month. Within that time frame Ive realized that Wal-mart does everything thing it possibly can to save a goddammed dime. Were severely skeleton staffed to the point where a majority of its current associates have been asked to work in just about every department once, while simultaneously maintaining their hired department. Damaged packaging, and some times products, are to remain on the sales floor, and its rather impossible to move up in positions unless you kiss the right asses. The starting pay wasnt too abominable, nor was it impressive, but certain nothing sustainable. Though, If it werent for the incredibly awesome customers( hard to believe, I know) that we get and the great associates I have at my location, I would have left 7 months ago. "
"How is this any different than those working at target, kmart, fast food joints, mall jobs.... This is a common theme of greed and corruption in this country."
"Walmart can burn to the ground along with fast food. Theyre not getting another dime from me. Theres no excuse to be paying your employees minimum wage or anything near it when really WE the consumers have given them the motherfucking opportunity to be so lucrative. But instead they take all the money for themselves, I will not support that. "
BREAKING NEWS: The Government Relies on Taxpayers to Subsidize NO Wages.
I feel like everyone knows this and nobody cares. Probably in a lot of places they dont have a choice because all the local businesses closed down after Walmart beat them to death with their low prices. 
"What?s really going on here is that Walmart is paying these people market rate wages, and the government is subsidizing them with money from people who get paid more because they produce more economic value. This is possible only because there are enough people producing more economic value. Ignoring for now the merits of doing that, that?s what?s going on here. If the US were a third-world country that did not have people producing enough economic value for the government to redistribute, this would not be possible. Now, if you believe these people should be subsidized, isn?t this the fair way to do it? The alternative is raising the minimum wage, forcing companies like Walmart to either pay their employees more than they would be otherwise worth, or to not hire them at all, letting them receive *all* their income from the government. This obviously screws over workers who don?t produce much value, since there?s no point in employing someone who provides less value than you?re legally required to pay them. You might say, ?Walmart really needs cashiers and people to stock shelves, and they can afford to pay them more than they are,? but if it costs too much for Walmart to pay cashiers, they can install shitty, user-hostile automated checkout systems instead, and if the minimum wage to hire people to stock shelves is too high, they can limit themselves to hiring people who are productive enough to make up the difference, again screwing over less-productive workers. Interestingly, many people who are not on government assistance, and are paying taxes, are still being subsidized by more productive people overall. The Heritage Foundation recently put out a fascinating (and controversial, but I think most of the complaints are stupid) report on the economic costs of immigration reform, as a result of having to provide subsidies to large numbers of unskilled immigrants. One example of a high-cost government benefit that people often don?t think about is the cost of providing public K?12 education. Children of illegal immigrants are already considered entitled to receving a public education at taxpayers? expense. This report estimates that this alone costs $12,300 per student per year. Overall, the report concludes that households headed by people who did not complete college are, on average, subsidized by the government, while higher-income households headed by people with college degrees, on average, pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. If you believe in redistribution of wealth, you might look at this and decide ?well, that sounds reasonable,? but it?s important to realize how the system actually works when deciding policy."
"[The Wal-Mart Effect](http://www.latimes.com/la-walmart-sg,0,7885526.storygallery): this series of articles is 10 years old but the info hasnt reached everyone. A recent study showed a pattern of Walmart increasing poverty in communities as local businesses fail and more people are left with little alternative but to shop (and often work) there. This hasnt changed in 10 years. "
"But its fine because it works and Americans seem *perfectly fine* with being the stooges who end up with the burden of making sure these people can still exist even though most work 40 hours per week and cannot keep their heads above water. Americans are to blame for their own misery. They dont only seem to support and enable the system that fucks them, about half seem to cheer it on."
"Taxpayers: Vote. Vote every time you are able. Vote for the individuals who represent you and your beliefs. Vote because we were given that right by the individuals who died for us to have that right. I read this post and can empathize for the individuals abused by corporations. However - the responsibility falls on the american taxpayers, consumers, and voters. Cooperatively, we have the ability to coerce change; however, individually one voice is futile. As far as Wal Mart - we can stop shopping there. We can choose to collectively pay more for goods that we use on a daily basis so that individuals employed are paid a decent wage; or, we can expect to pay as little as possible and maintain current standards. The thing is that as Americans, we want it all. We want the stock markets to continue to climb, the standard of life to rise for all, and the rights of all to be equal. However, collectively we are not willing to take a stand to make these things equal. We are not collectively willing to pay more, sacrifice more, and agree to work together to be better. Sorry to rant, but this is a revolving issue that overwhelmingly goes against the big guy (i.e. walmart) and is less considerate of the bigger problem(s). "
"Im going to be that guy: if you dont like the way Wal-Mart does business then dont accept a position from them. In my book, If you accept a job that *you* applied for in the first place, then complaining about it makes you the asshole, rather than the company that hired you. "
"This is bullshit! And the owners of the company, THE WALTONS are billionaires. Theres something wrong with this people!"
"I cant find the study mentioned in the article, but maybe Reddit can answer my question: What portion of the workers receiving government assistance are part-time?"
"Wal-Mart should be paying these workers AT LEAST $20.00/hr! Wal-Mart employees are the most knowledgeable, approachable, and respectable people I know. Not everyone can operator a register, unload products off a truck, and push carts together. Furthermore, Wal-Mart employees are forced to work there. They dont have the option of quitting or going elsewhere for better pay. Heck, even before Wal-Mart, the company forced its employees into making bad decisions, made them sign a contract which prevented them of having ambition, drive, or the will to succeed. How dear a corporation pay people market wages! Companies should not be allowed to earn profits - they should have to return this money back to the less fortunate. If Wal-Mart workers were paid $20.00/hr, their productivity would undoubtedly rise; thus, earning more money for Wal-Mart. This is all very simple to understand as I am in college and took business 101. As a result, I understand everything about business and economics."
"Ive worked at Marshalls it wasnt bad, even gotten a position for a job as manager after 3 months. Too bad it was a summer job. "
This is old news. They keep hours low and wages lower and actually help employees file for governor aid.
"I work at Walmart, and they truly are one of the worst company to work for. They take advantage of everyone, its employes, its customers, and the government. Customers think that they save money shopping at Walmart, but with how much they cost the taxpayers by having so much of its employers on government assistance, I believe that everybody (except Walmart) ends up loosing. Last year in our store they cut hours for everyone including its full timers (which there are less and less of them every year) so much, that they had the number of the citys unemployment office next to the time clock with instructions advising the full timers that they may be eligible to collect some unemployment, because their hours had drop so much. We also have a couple of paid holidays that we get time-and-a-half, but what they do to screw us of that extra money is that they schedule us a day less for that week, so we end up losing money in the end. This are just a few of the many many ways Walmart like to screw us all."
"This whole thread makes my heart leap with sadness for all of you who have chosen to work because you think you have to. Because society has convinced you that you need money. That you are somehow destined to be another mans resource to wealth for the rest of your years. For god sake. Take each others contacts down and build a little network. This way, In a couple of months or however long it takes you to organize, you guys can go rob one of these fucking Wal-Marts and sell all the shit on E-bay. At very least STOP WORKING FOR THE MAN! when you do this, you perpetuate the current economical climate. The one where average Joes like you and me line up for jobs that dont even make a living wage. ASK YOUR NEIGHBORS FOR HELP. Stop trying to shoulder the weight of life all on your own. That is ridiculous! Take the little bit of help the government does afford you. WIC, EBT, Whatever. OUR TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THAT. The government doesnt mind spending OUR MONEY on ridiculous wars and secret programs. Not to mention lining their pockets with it. Take Haliburton for example. All the while scaling back useful community development and cutting budgets for EDUCATION. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST PEOPLE. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET TIRED OF THIS SHIT? You have to stop feeding the trolls for them to go away and guess what! You have to stop feeding Wal-Mart too. Start today. Organize with your fellow man. Commit to an agenda. Stop the insanity and begin the process of [autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy). "
So get rid of the welfare system and the taxpayers wont be subsidizing anyone. 
I wonder how many of the upvoters still shop at Walmart. My guess most will continue. 
TIL people didnt already know this... Guess that explains why people still shop there.
"Honestly, I would work at Wal-Mart for minimum wage."
dont work at a walmart...profit. College degree says WAA???
End the subsidies then. All other retail jobs and restaurant industry pay the same shitty wages. Why is Walmart even singled out?
What job function at Wal-Mart are you people under the impression should either pay more than minimum wage or takes more skill than a minimum wage job?
ITT Wall of text.
"Wal-Mart is just going what every other corporation tries to do: privitize their profits and socialize their losses. You cant blame them for it, because they are just doing the most logical thing that a business should do. If you want to get mad, get mad at the big government politicians that fleece taxpayers to transfer wealth to the elite."
Ummmm duh.....I thought this was common knowledge.
[deleted]
I blame the employees.
Somehow you are tooling way too hard
Most of these stories remind me of the shit conditions as a former Target employee.
[Great book for anyone interested in this or how other corporations benefit from our tax dollars](http://www.amazon.com/Free-Lunch-Wealthiest-Themselves-Government/dp/B002HREKHS)
I havent shopped at a walmart in over a year. I wish more people would do the same.
One of my friends has been working for the same wal-mart since 2004 when we were in high-school and he is in the exact same position he started in and only makes 12 dollars an hour.
"Fuck that...try working for IPC International...you can save a fucking life and the fucking company still doesnt give two shits about you. Nor do they care about giving you a raise after 3 years of service, even when then promised you a raise every year when you signed on. We can bitch about Wal Mart every day, but I can say my buddy who has been working there for as long as I have for IPC is making far more than I have in my three years there. Not to mention he has superior insurance to my bs insurance. True story....and I hope there are others who have worked for IPC and I am not alone... "

"A little lingo for walmarters, coming from someone that used to work there overnight for almost 4 years. I was told I didnt need a pallet jack to stock pets, and I was coached for not throwing 14 pallets in a night, because I didnt have said jack. I refused to sign it, they filed it anyway. Last two nights of work there shortly after that were a call in and an ncns. Worst mother fuckin company I have ever worked for. Dont shop there anymore either, Feelsgoodman.jpg. I now work at a grocery store. A baby step up while Im in school, but honestly fml. "
"As a Walmart associate ill say its not the best company to work fir but Ive worked at worse. To all those with terrible stories about management. I suggest you use the open door policy which allows you to go as high in the company as you want with a problem. In my personal experience the regional hr manager overturned a coaching. While it might not be the best place for everyone, to pretend they are the only company to use these practices and pay these wages is ridiculous . Even meijers which is unionized doesnt pay more than Walmart. Obviously the union isnt doing them any good. I also would like to point out that this article and others like it like to make it seem like most the associates are striking or want a union. The wording is misleading as if this were the case something would have changed. Your gonna need more than a few hundred people. "
Related: Union membership is at a 70 year low.
i guess if you dont subsidize in the first place companies like walmart cant come to rely on the subsidies.
I will never support Wal Mart with a single penny. 
I dont get why it is the employers responsibility to provide benefits in the first place. Part of me thinks it might be better if it were the other way around; employers *cannot* be involved in peoples healthcare or retirement decisions.
"Trickle down, in effect."
lol THIS is news? More like old news. They whole Wal-Mart/Fast-Food industry is full of shitty jobs. I used to work at KFC. I made $7.25/hr and worked 20-35 hours a week. The schedule was determined weekly (so I had to plan my weeks around when my boss says I work) and most weeks it was out late or right at the deadline (last shift of the old schedule). If you start requesting to many days off a week then youd get a reduction in hours. Even if I only work four days a week and request that two specific days (instead of whenever my boos feels like) are my days off I would get reduced to 3 days for a few weeks. Whats worse is that these jobs are dead end. Fastfood managers make like $9 an hour and that is the cap unless they are really good or have connections. That is insane. $9?? I work in a factory now and the operators that dont even have a high school education make $17-18 an hour! DOUBLE! Regardless I dont see how this is news. Its just a fact that jobs like this are dead end and shitty.
"If you didnt already know this, you are either a teenager or an idiot."
My only problem with this is that all businesses dont do it. The government should provide food and health care for all citizens and then they can work to earn whatever else they want.
America is for the corporations made by the corporations 
You cannot blame a company for getting away with such things if the system around it allows it. Business is business and unfortunately large businesses like this will take the piss.
The big question: why do Americans allow themselves to be treated so shabbily? Any ideas? 
"I shop elsewhere. I may pay a bit more for groceries but I KNOW that the folks selling me those groceries are getting paid decently. If they have more, then the local economy works better for everyone."
Low wages should be illegal. 
We know.
"Yes, just like all who use illegal aliens are offloading their costs onto everyone else. Their profit margin is stolen tax payer money. "
I await a follow-up post that mysteriously gets upvoted to the top of /r/all praising how Wal-Mart donates a lot of money to orphans and gives CPR to dolphins. You know its coming.
"Hmm America, fascism, robbing of the public by criminals who do nothing, police and bought and paid for politicians do nothing about it, people tolerate it and go back to watching the shows made to distract them from reality by the same people robbing them Sounds about right"
As a New Zealander i have no idea what the whole deal with Wal-mart is. Why do so many special people go there.
the math used is bullshit
"I dont get it. Walmart is one of the most hated companies in America; both for their use of Chinese products (I understand, but have not been able to verify, that they use several Chinese perishable products such as mayonnaise that are made according to no particular regulations and shipped over here in 500-gallon bags for packaging so they can say Packaged in America), southeast asian sweatshop labor and their shitty treatment of employees. So why is it that every year their profits (and customers) grow and grow? People in America need to realize that **WE** have the power to change companies bad behavior, but **we only have the power to do so as an organized boycott**. Companies speak one language; Money. Anything that makes them start losing money will get attention. Anything that has *no* effect on their revenue or net profit will get **NO** attention. I used to work for Walmart. Back in 2007 ago they hired me as an unloader. Id never been paid so poorly in my life $8.35 for working in the elements (There was a roof over my head but on bone-chilling days, we felt it. On sweltering days we REALLY felt it. We just didnt get precipitation.) with absolutely no overtime (I once got sent home, I shit you not, 2 minutes early to kill overtime.) and terrible benefits. I only stayed because I needed the job, but every minute of my free time was spent looking for a new job. It took 4 months but I found one. A manufacturer of precision optics was hiring and **MAN** did I keep on them about getting me an interview. Turns out that while I had almost none of the skills and prerequisites they wanted, and they had a line of applicants straight out the door, they liked my drive enough to bring me on, but not for the job that was advertised. Instead, I became an optical machinists apprentice and they taught me everything I needed to make precision optical lenses. They also paid for my education in full and now I happily hold a masters degree in optical engineering and have been working for the same company ever since. So, happy ending for me! In all that time, though, Ive never forgiven Walmart for the way they treated me. I havent shopped there since. I drive 2 extra miles to go to Target. I pay the extra cash to get prescriptions filled at CVS and everything else I just order off Amazon and wait for it to arrive. By my estimates, their mistreating me has cost them about $10,000 (at least) over the last 5 years. Sure thats not even pocket change to them, but its plenty to me, and if more people felt that way, it would cost them a LOT more money. I hate Walmart with a burning passion and flat REFUSE to shop there even if Im desperate for something that only they have in stock. I only wish more people did. If the average person spends $100/week at Walmart (I think thats reasonable since many people do grocery shopping there.) and we got 100,000 people in this country to stop shopping there, Walmart would lose $520 million a year in revenue. That doesnt sound like a lot considering their revenue is well over $400 billion a year, but their margins are very slim. A drop in net profit from $17 billion to $16.48 billion would get noticed. They might shrug it off, but theyd notice. In addition, if their low level employees (I know department managers and store managers are quite happy with their jobs, even though they are still underpaid by industry comparison) stopped putting up with Walmarts bullshit and demanded better treatment or theyd quit.. that would get noticed too. Right now Walmart holds all the cards. The American people care more about the price tags on the shelves than the way Walmart treats their fellow Americans. And the Walmart employees are stuck in a self-defeating rut of I cant find a better job and Im stuck here. The government should do something! Im a firm believer that any time someone says there should be a law, there almost certainly should NOT be a law. There are many unintended consequences that arise when legislation gets enacted and one of the worst comes with the minimum wage. Yes, Im sorry to burst my fellow lefties and centrists conceptions about the minimum wage but it has been shown time and again that minimum wage hikes accelerate inflation; completely erasing any gains that were made with the hike. Whats more, hiking the min wage again (to stay ahead of inflation) might keep times good for a while (Like the 60s), but down the line it will make things very very bad (Like the 70s) and just wind up kicking a snowball downhill until its the size of a mountain. The only ones that have the pure power to stop companies like Walmart from being dicks are the consumers. Everything (And I do mean **EVERYTHING**) in this economy begins and ends with us. If we want Walmart to stop being assholes to their employees, **we need to stop paying them to do exactly that**."
"Moral of this story is... DONT BUY THE SHIT THEY SELL AT WALMART!!!! Dont even go into one of them. Kmart and Sears still exist, and when they were #1 they both used to pay their employees, give the benefits AND profit sharing plans... Fuck Walmart!"
Capitalist greed working as intended! 
"I love how Americans say increasing wages will destroy your economy, well guess what your economy is already destroyed due to low wages. If other countries can afford health care, increased benefits, happier, and a higher standard of living, ie Canada, Australia, All the Scandinavian countries; why can USA not have the same things?"
"I slept overnight at a wal mart for 2 nights to eBay a new ps3. They let me and my buddy sleep in the layaway/site to store area. The manager wheeled out a TV with some DVDs for us to watch. It was much better than sleeping outside a best buy, but the wal mart cheer was unsettling. I shop there weekly (well my wife does) and we are satisfied with the store."
Another way this could be written: Taxpayers rely on Walmart to subsidize public assistance
"I think what we all have to realize is that they are still within their legal rights to operate their business on a such a manner. That being said, its up to the 300 Million of us to actively participate in our pseudo-Democratic system and elect the right people, fight for regulations and laws and be a part of changing things for the better. Yes its hard with so many lobbyists running things but we have the power to vote people out of office and elect the right officials. Start local and build up. It starts with the man in the mirror. Step up."
Badgercare? Really Wisconsin?
"They use a service offered by the govt funded by taxpayers No different than using water, or roads,etc"
"And Target makes even less, just an FYI."
"I love how liberals seem to love people being on government assistance, **except** when its because a corporation is purposely giving low hours and telling people to ask for government money. Im not saying that Walmart is right for having policies like this, but it is obvious that Democrats are only making this argument for two reasons. 1 - They hate Walmart, and will do anything to force them to lose money. 2 - They want higher minimum wages across the board, because they believe that it will lead to greater prosperity for the populace. What they forget is the fact that if the wages have to be raised, it means innumerable companies, Walmart included, will have to raise prices to compensate. That same Walmart supercenter, assuming 300 people working 25 hours per week, making $10.10 an hour instead of $7.25 means $1,111,500 per year in lost revenue. This **will** be passed on to the consumers. The very same consumers that are also working at the Walmart. And that is only the short term effects."
Wal-Mart to Middle-Class America: F U
Just know that all the horror stories you hear about WalMart also hold true to Target. Target just has a better PR team.
Walmart is the fucking devil 
Isnt this old news? I thought this was brought up late last year? 
"The fact is that if Walmart raised wages and paid benefits as many of you in this thread think they should do, they would also have to decrease their labor force substantially. So, although a significant amount of Walmart employees would be lifted above the poverty line, many many more would be condemned to it. Is this really a better solution?"
"If they raise there prices then those like me not living the high life but getting by will suffer. Its a stock company they answer to stock owners who want (rightly) to see a return on their investment. What do we do with our unskilled labor force, if they have to pay better wages and provide health insurance then all the teenagers, older unskilled workers will be bump out of a job, lets be honest if you had the skills to work somewhere else at a better rate you would. If you qualify for food stamps you most likely qualify for a pell grant and day care assistance, take advantage and get out. Not trying to be mean just curious what reddit readers think is a good fix for this? I wish I would have taken advantage when I was young. I have a hard physical job, I just put in enough years where I can pay the bills. "
Its not just Walmart. I believe that this idea has a lot to do with the low accepted pay rates and the relatively higher cost of living.
So either stop subsidizing them or quit whining.
"It is extremely disingenuous for this sub to constantly present the issue of wages for unskilled labor as a Walmart issue. Many other businesses that rely on unskilled labor use the same exact business practices, but nobody bats an eye because they dont profit nearly as much. Believe it or not, wages are not determined by profit, and constantly pointing the finger at Walmart for not paying higher wages because they can only demonstrates the ignorance many in this sub have concerning the issue and economics in general."
"Walmart may treat its employees horribly, but government subsidization of people lowly skilled people doing simple jobs is better than government subsidization of lowly skilled people without jobs. What would happen if the minimum wage was raised? Walmart would figure out how to do the same thing with less employees and these same people wouldnt doing anything. What pisses me off a lot more is that there are plenty of assholes making twice as much working at Trader Joes when there are so many nice people who work at Walmart. Those fuckers at Trader Joes even switch their name tags around all of the time so you cant even complain about them."
"If youve never seen the documentary Walmart: the high cost of low price you need to. Wal-Marta douchbaggery is no new story. The film was made in 2005 and talks about wal-mart tactics using many shady practices, and encouraging its employees to use federal assistance instead of offering fair benefits. While Im not saying that wal-mart is the only shitty company out there, the film shows good insight into corporate greed and bullshit"
"What if I told you walmart subsidizes the federal government with the tax revenues it produces, and has every right to pay employees who arent obligated to work there any legal wage they want - morpheous meme"
"Isnt this retail life in general though? Just exactly how much should Walmart, or any company, pay an unskilled worker? Okay, they probably do profit more than most, but does that mean because of that, cashiers or greeters should make $20/hr with full benefits? Lets say they do that. Well, then every other retailer has to follow suit, places close up shop, more jobs are lost, and Walmart is at fault yet again. "
"I once asked to give a customer service rep a kudos at walmart, they had me fill out five minutes of paperwork. Cmon walmart "
"I worked at Walmart for 5 years (from senior year in high school until I found a job in my preferred field after graduating from my university). I was never treated poorly, I made more than minimum wage for MA (I felt it was fair for the work I did), and my managers never asked me to volunteer time. I worked very hard, I enjoyed the daily grind, and I always received good performance reviews. Im not saying that what you all are saying is untrue, just that you need to consider that its not always the corporation as a whole, since each store can be run a little differently. My store was always enjoyable to work in, and I know most of the people there that worked with me are still happy being with the company. Theyve had a lot of room for growth and promotions, and the customers mostly enjoy their experience from what Ive always heard. Maybe we just had the right mix of employees to create the atmosphere, but the business itself never felt corrupt like all these stories and documentaries try to make it seem."
"For every one that chooses to walk, there 10 willing to start the next morning. Lower the wage to $5 and they would still have 4 for every one. Part time jobs with low wages are going to be more common in the future. Small business can barely afford the employees they have and a higher minimum wage would mean some have to go and the remaining get to work twice as hard. Higher costs, mean higher prices. How are all those minimum wage part timers going to afford the affordable health care act."
Solution: listen to libertarians and end public welfare which relies on government redistribution of force.
"You assume that if we had no welfare programs that Wal-Mart would pay more. That cannot be farther from the truth. Wal-Mart, almost exclusively, hires people for UNSKILLED labor positions. A position literally everyone can do, it requires no marketable skill. For example, a job that required extensive training and experience pays more than a job that requires **zero** training and **zero** experience."
"Well I just dont buy crap from Walmart, havent in probably a good 15 years. I go to Costco, or my local Target. But it just seems like these companies are just making slaves out of their workers with no real thought to them as human beings. If they would pull their heads out of their asses and actually pay their employees better working wages, then this might not happen. But employess to companies like this are just numbers, and bottom line figures and nothing else. Seriously though, folks, if this really bothers you that much, just dont patronize their stores. Dont buy from them. "
"Thought of another way: social safety net programs allow workers to work for lower wages than they would otherwise be able to. Its a chicken and egg. Were these programs started in response to Walmart paying low wages, or did Walmart start out paying low wages because they knew they could push their workers onto public assistance. "
Are we mad that Wal-Mart is employing people or that employed people are getting government subsidies? Neither of these things offends me. Did you know that most Fortune 500 employees collect Social Security when they retire? Fat Cat Fortune 500 companies rely on government safety net to pay portion of retirees income. I bet thatll make your butt hurt.
Disgusting. 
My mother and I hate this place so much that we drive 45 mins just to go to Target.
"Raise the minimum wage to $20/hr and well still be paying for them. Because once inflation catches up, that will be the new bottom. Not to mention, just because Walmart can afford to pay that wage does not mean all businesses can. "
"It isnt just walmart either, a lot of retail pays barely above minimum wage with almost no hours. We shouldnt just blame walmart, but all these places that pay their employees less than a liveable wage."
"Cant you see the propaganda here? Unions are missing out on billions in dollars in revenue! They have singled out Walmart just because they are the biggest employer. There are a lot if other bad companies and many other industries have worse working conditions and wages. When I lived in the Midwest, I was jealous of my friends that worked at Walmart. I worked at a restaurant and sometimes didnt even make minimum wage. The work was much harder than any job at Walmart. I didnt get breaks, and I was taken advantage of regularly. "
"There managers make around $140,000. A lot of it bonus money. "
i think theyve reversed it. the intrusion of taxpayer-funded programs into the labor market lowered wages 
 Employers should pay a living wage. It should be high enough to DQ the worker from food stamps.
"Having worked for Wal-Mart for 8 years through high school and college, I can say it wasnt that bad. Yeah there were some shitty policies but when dealing with such a large company, it comes with the territory. Your work experience is largely dependent on the managers you have working above you as with any job. Their low wages are par for the course but by the time I graduated college I was making really good money after all my annual raises. I pushed carts a majority of those years because it was good exercise and I like the outdoors. Economics dictate wages if people are willing to work for that, then they are going to pay that. That comes at the consequence of hiring a lot of shitty workers and some of those shitty workers become managers, who in turn, make working for Wal-Mart a shitty experience. Unless you become a manager, its really not a job in which you can raise a family with. Dont expect big bucks working a job more suited for a high school student."
"I dont frequent political comment sections or read the news anymore but I would like to say THIS IS A GREAT ARGUMENT AND NEEDS TO BE THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRATIC/PROGRESSIVE POLITICS GOING FORWARD. Its smart, true, hard to argue with and places the onus where it should be placed."
"Sometimes the safty net we weave, doesnt help those we intend to."
"couple that with invading towns putting other places out of business, turning main streets into ghost town, they are just a leech on society."

"I worked for Wal-Mart while in college for about 2 years and im not suprised about any of the stories being told by former employees. I can remember that our stores turnover GOAL for the year was 45%. 45%!? Its because they have no qualms at all with letting someone go, no matter how long they have worked our how dedicated the employee. What was probably the most shocking thing to me of all is how the store co-managers (there is a manager and 2 cos along with many underling assistant managers) can make 100k a year which was confirmed by one of them during a new hire orientation I attended. "
Anyone else feel like people who cant get a job except for the worst ones at Wal-Mart are just going to be unemployed if Wal-Mart cant afford to employ them? 
It is funny how the same people advocating a government role in health care are arguing its a drag on society/tax payers when WalMart comes into the picture...
"Im a former Wal-Mart graveyard shift worker 13 years ago. Next to Frys Electronics, WM is the worst retail business to work for, because they never treat you as a human being, only a worker bee drone. I quit the job as a stocker when two assistant managers accuse me of placing two ladders in the corner of the aiseles, and they took the polaroid photos to claim Im at fault when I worked the pet food and supplies area. I dont recollect ever using the ladders in the corner of the aisle when pet food and supplies are adjacent in the rows of aisles. Much later, 12 years later, I met an older college student who told me he worked as an assistant manager at a different WM location. He agreed with me about the uniformly cynical corporate culture of management. This cynical attitude supervising the dozens of worker bee drones felt overwhelmingly negative for which he had to quit since it made him feel unhappy, having to kiss the upper managements ass constantly while ruling over the worker bees with selective criticism. WM probably lost its soul after the founder Sam Walton died, and greedy predatory capitalism takes over with pressure of suppliers for the discount-rate price and support of outsourcing for manufacturing at a cheaper rate to import and sell for a profit. WM is unabashedly evil in exploitation and greed, worshiping the almighty dollar. Ah, America."
"i work for walmart (2 1/2 years) its pretty bad i was hired for eletronics but after 3-4pm everyone goes home .. i would have to do eletronics photo site2store ...cut fabric lol wtf i was hired for eletronics .... also carryouts seeing they out door greeters on that and no offense to them but ill do it picking up a 50 tv....Oh and doing the truck is so much fun ....lol they could careless and if your not a favorite might aswell pack it up (wich im doing) .....i recently transfered to overnights mod team they tols me i couldnt be full time because they couldnt pay for it.. i said okay (kinda pissed) they cut me so bad i only worked 3 nights a week and lost a 1$ extra on sunday ... not much money but 15-20$ out of my paycheck just on sundays alone ...lol then come to find out i was fulltime now im getting full 40 hrs .... my walmart isnt 24 hrs its in the mist of remod so i know why i got cut ;) ...

Recently unemployed for 2.5 years. Never shopped at Wal-Mart
"Time to do something about it. Nevermind, lets just watch TV and eat pre-packaged food and drink sodas."
"So many retailers pull shit like this, you cant win unless you stop shopping. This is self righteous as fuck to denounce it when all of our stuff is from China in the end. Most of us have subscribed to this type of capitalism, so Id consider shopping domestic (way more $$$) before you rant."
China is pulling the rug out from us etc... We need Government 2.0 not more laws slapped on a rusted out frame
"The article actually showed how the analyst arrived at the $900k figure. This makes me feel warm, even with the 900,0000 typo."
"Woah, I just started working at walmart at $13.50 an hour, 40 hours a week, in a wonderfully air conditioned building with a lot of nice people. I was expecting minimum wage."

Be conscious shoppers yall! The people hold the power!
"Walmart is certainly guilty but they arent the only one. We should broaden the scope and realize many people reading this right now are victims of the low wage, no benefit model so widely embraced by companies and sadly workers. "
Business Insider relies on reddit to subsidize bullshit.
"I hated working there. I got written up for a trash bag behind the register. The AM took a picture of it in the morning. When I left and clocked out that bag was not there. I told her that and she said I dont care. Different day I got a verbal warning about how the electronics department was messy. Well fuck me for helping the customers at the busiest store in Oklahoma with 3 co workers calling in sick. The Zone Manager took a picture of me while I was helping a customer and didnt say why and came back an hour later saying he took a picture of me to verify that it was me that told his friend that was shopping to never shop at Walmart and shop at Best Buy instead. I never said that to anyone ever and I didnt even work in the electronics department that day. I was stocking the hardware department the whole day and I have a Assistant Manager to back me up. Fucking horrible job, great co workers but I hated being told I was wrong every day while following what they wanted. "
It might be impossible to support yourself being a poet also. So do something else. Maybe walmart shouldnt be a career path but just a part time job for college kids or the temporarily unemployed in transition. 
Has Walmart ever paid a living wage?
The children and grandchildren of Sam Walton grow fat while America starves. These people should be hunted in the streets like all Tories.
"Not Walmart but Target, I worked at Target my first few years of college. Every semester I had to submit a new availability calendar to work around my classes. I did this as requested and got it approved by my team leader. Over the next several weeks they kept scheduling me outside of my availability, forcing me to choose to skip classes or skip work. I complained about this probably a half dozen times, to HR, to my team leader, even to the store manager... they all assured me they would take care of it but if I was scheduled I must come in to work, even if they make a mistake. I skipped some classes, but some I could not skip, and after 3 or 4 such occasions I was called into the big bosses office and asked why I was missing so much work. I explained the story exactly as I am right now, and he knew about it because I had spoken to him a few weeks earlier about it... Get this, after a few minutes of arguing about whether it was reasonable or not to force me to skip my classes he told me that I had to get my priorities straight.... that was that last fucking straw, I told him I have my priorities straight, my college education is my priority, I will not be a loser working in retail in my 40s, I am graduating with a degree in computer science in two years and I promise I will come back here as a software engineer and have you carry my bags to my Corvette. Consider this my resignation.... I did come back after graduating and starting a good career, but that guy had been transferred to a different store, I did see and talk to my old team leader for a moment though, felt good. (never did get that Corvette... got 2 sons instead, but theyre better)"
"Yup, preeeeety much."

"Unlike the Benghazi/IRS conspiracy theories, the NSA issue is real. Its just that no one besides freetards and libertarians care about the NSA issue. "
"Disagreement with the handling of someone who broke a large number of high-profile federal laws is not a scandal. While I applaud Snowden for raising awareness, all he did was expose wide-ranging, *but completely legal* NSA surveillance. Everything the NSA did was either approved by the courts or explicitly authorized under the Patriot Act. The outrage should not be over the fact that this surveillance occurs, but rather that theres nothing illegal about it. Wake up, people--this shit has been legal (and ongoing) for well over a decade. Its a little late to be acting surprised."
"The Republicans havent been focusing on the NSA leak. Theyve been focusing on the IRS and Benghazi scandals, which are both phony. "
"Okay so it says you cant protest where the secret service is incharge of security. Is it safe to say that everywhere the SS is, they are in change of security? "
The fourth amendment was violated
"Considering it was a Republican administration (Bush II) that crafted the so called Patriot Act, and a Republican dominated Congress that passed it, and right leaning Supreme Court that declared it constitutional the republicans have no right to complain just because the illegal and immoral spying program they created, authorized, and put into place is used by a non-Republican administration."
"why, [weve learned nothing new since 2007.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/) Not a single thing. If it took Snowdens theatrics and global game of catch me if you can to inform you of old news, thats your fault. And frankly, it pisses me the hell off we have to sit through yet another media circus of nothing."
I hardly think the NSA leak is a phony scandal EDIT: Obama just signed a bill into law that makes it illegal to protest where the secret service is. Let that sink in
Meanwhile the republicans just voted against NSA legislation in congress. Its clear that they are pro these NSA policies. 
"The White House issued an urgent press release late Tuesday, fervently opposing Rep.

"What promises has he kept? *I refer specifically to promises made to the American public, not ones done in private to industry reps or intelligence agency directors."
"Fact check: **FALSE.** Dick Cheney did *NOT* profit handsomely and directly from the Iraq war. Before he entered office, he assigned all of his stock options to charity and purchased an insurance policy to guarantee his deferred compensation. He didnt stand to gain or lose *a single penny* based on Haliburtons performance. Not one cent. http://www.factcheck.org/kerry_ad_falsely_accuses_cheney_on_halliburton.html &gt;**Summary** &gt;A Kerry ad implies Cheney has a financial interest in Halliburton and is profiting from the companys contracts in Iraq. The fact is, Cheney doesnt gain a penny from Halliburtons contracts, and almost certainly wont lose even if Halliburton goes bankrupt. - - &gt;**Stock Options** &gt;That still would leave the possibility that Cheney could profit from his Halliburton stock options if the companys stock rises in value. However, Cheney and his wife Lynne have assigned any future profits from their stock options in Halliburton and several other companies to charity. And were not just taking the Cheneys word for this -- we asked for a copy of the legal agreement they signed, which we post here publicly for the first time. &gt;The Gift Trust Agreement the Cheneys signed two days before he took office turns over power of attorney to a trust administrator to sell the options at some future time and to give the after-tax profits to three charities. The agreement specifies that 40% will go to the University of Wyoming (Cheneys home state), 40% will go to George Washington Universitys medical faculty to be used for tax-exempt charitable purposes, and 20% will go to Capital Partners for Education, a charity that provides financial aid for low-income students in Washington, DC to attend private and religious schools. &gt;The agreement states that it is irrevocable and may not be terminated, waived or amended, so the Cheneys cant take back their options later."
"Ad the problem there is that if they are rich, they probably have investments that will influence their votes/policies. Which is why some use blind trusts for their investments while in office. Of course some dont. Dick Cheney didnt and owned massive blocks of Halliburton stock. He profited handsomely and directly from the Iraq war."
"Wow! I was wrong! Does his charitable giving have an impact on his taxes? If the value of his options go up, does he get more tax benefit? Anyway, I wont be repeating that again, since I consider Fact Check to be a reputable source. Thank you for correcting me."
I gave you a list of known facts and debating is hard for people like you. Got it. 
No. No you didnt. You gave me a list of your unsupported beliefs and you apparently dont know the difference. Ill throw you a bone: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/06/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-failed-pass-budget/ People like me. Thats rich.
&gt;13 separate Gallup multiple-day polls Another way to say this is 42% of jobless people who are willing to conduct phone surveys Identify as Independents.
"Independent is an actual party. It is a conservative party used as a ploy by Republicans, including Tea Partiers, to mobilize the apathetic vote. If you dont want to be registered with a party, register as unaffiliated. "
Probably tea party considering themselves independent but still voting republican.
Still a 0-percent chance that the next U.S. president will be an Independent.
"The only reason the GOP wins anything is because of redistricting. Basically, destroying the democratic principle of majority wins. It takes a whole lot more votes to elect Democrat than the same exact districts Republican and thats just plain wrong and unfair. Its changing the rules, moving the goal line- its literally the only way the horrible ideas of the current GOP are even voted on at all."
I wonder what percentage of them will vote Independent. 
Independent is what a conservative calls himself when he realizes the GOP is an embarrassment. Not that it changes his voting pattern.
There is no doubt that part...just part...of that is the influx into the libertarian view on many issues.
"This aint going to change much. For most of the last 2 decades most Americans havent identified themselves as Republicans and yet election after election, the GOP has won. This shows how powerful of a tool apathy is for the Republican party. When they are able to turn off Americans from voting and convince people that both parties are the same it greatly works to their favor. This is also why being able to block or discourage certain groups is such a priority for them. If they can stifle the black, Hispanic or inner city vote, then the GOP has a chance because their members tend to vote fairly consistency like good little soldiers."
The republicans have known full well their base is eroding. Thats why theyve worked so hard to suppress voting and to gerrymander districts. Dont expect the make-up of congress to change much any time soon.
"I know a lot of people who are very much consistent GOP lever voters who claim to be independent. I mean lets face it, it is downright embarrassing to claim to be a Republican these days."
"I hate these statistics because I dont know anyone who has been surveyed, and I cant see how it is representative as a result. Tell me why Im wrong."
"sure. get back to me when [the reelection rate for Congressional incumbents](https://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/reelect.php) (from either party) starts to drop much below 90 percent. it would be nice, but it would also be more than a little surprising especially if it persisted for more than one election cycle. "
identify as != vote as or even vote
"100% Americans should be independent. Why on earth should we be asked, when registering to vote, to implicitly endorse one party over the other (thereby implicitly rejecting the other)? "
Good thing Republicans have some tricks up their sleeves like gerrymandering and voter identification requirements!
A independent is someone whom will vote either way depending on which candidate they feel is better. However the truth behind the new rise of independents is that most of them are just embarrassed republicans that will still vote for what ever turd the GOP produces. Calling themselves independents just makes them feel better.. 
Does this mean they will vote for reasonable people and we can be done with this shit now?
"The thing to remember is that most people who claim they are independent are not. People like to feel different and important, but if you ask most independents who theyve voted for in the past ten years, you are going to see that they usually vote for the same party year in and year out"
"Yet every election, everybody gets scared by the other camp and then just votes for either Democrat or Republican."
"I register as a Repulblican so I can vote in their primaries and call myself a Republican, but the GOP is a joke and youve got to be either rich or stupid (religious) to support it. The Dems are bought and paid for by Wall Street, too, so fuck both parties. The Hon. Bernie Sanders says its impossible to pass legislation that Wall St. doesnt like, anyway so fuck it all. Politics is a rigged game and unless youve got a couple hundred million dollars lying around ready to burn, the ones who do will keep power."
No incumbents 2016! Whos with me?
"And that means ... zero. Americans can identify as whatever the fuck they want, the government is bought and paid for by lobbies and big business. And Im pretty sure about 99% of those groups identify as members of the FuckYouImRich Party, which is, BY FAR, the most influential political party in Washington, followed closely by the OldWhiteMenWith1950sMorals Party. Note: It is VERY easy, and generally encouraged, to be a member of BOTH those parties."
No surprising. To an outsider the Republican Party seems like a political tool for corporate interests only. 
You all need to educate yourselves on the Commission for Presidential debates before discussing the relevance of this poll. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NXhoP5bQ2M&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
"Im happy to see this number. The more people that dont align with a single party, the sooner politicians will start voting on issues as they should instead of just being partisan and voting what their party wants of them."
"As a registered Republican for over 32 years, the last 10 as a RINO, I finally changed my voter registration because the party no longer represents me. It all came down to being too embarrassed to even be identified as such. Hello? Science anyone?"
Bill Oreilly calls himself an independent...
"I dont care about how they identify. I care about how they vote. And the bulk of them vote Republican, but since Bush II are embarassed to admit it. As well they should be."
http://www.gallup.com/poll/166763/record-high-americans-identify-independents.aspx Record-High 42% of Americans Identify as Independents. Republican identification lowest in at least 25 years. 
"independents - I know so many of these online. They defend republicans, hold republican ideals and vote for republicans, but they are independents god dammit!"
But still vote for republican or democrat.
"Honestly, I feel ? as a recent Republican voter ? this is due to the polarisation of the Republican party. I have conservative tendencies (deficit hawk amongst others) yet I cannot, and refuse to be, enamoured by the religious and moral aspects that tend to dominate the Republican party. "
"Partway through 2003, people were evenly split between Republican, Democrat, and Independent, all at about 33%. Democrats have fallen to 31% and Republicans to 25%, while Independents have climbed to 42%. Just looking at the numbers, it seems pretty clear that people who used to identify as Republican have moved to Independent. As a former Republican who is now registered to vote with No Party Affiliation, my anecdotal personal experience supports the data. The weird part is that when I talk politics with Republicans, they seem determined to call me RINO and heap scorn on me and pretty much do everything they can to keep me from coming back. Doesnt seem a very effective strategy."
Probably stated like a thousand times already but a lot of these self-proclaimed Independents lean toward one party a lot more than the other 
and yet everyone in my fucking suburb is a republican
"This could be misleading. I know people who always vote Republican but insist theyre independent. I think they want to be perceived as more open-minded and rational, but when you talk to them its just Fox News talking points. I think theyre aware theres a perception of crazy extremism, but not so much that theyd actually change their views on anything. Just enough to disavow association, while remaining a proponent of crazy extremist views."
"Like I said, the religious right is destroying the Republican Party. Unfortunately, theyll do a hell of a lot of damage before theyre dead. "
"People really started abandoning the Republicans after 2004 when they had the presidency and both houses and started spending like crazy. I think there is a large chunk of the country that wants a fiscally conservative government. Basically spend money in trying to help the truly needdy, provide a military that can defend us not maintain a world empire, and provide some essential traditional government functions like courts, roads, pollution control, etc. It seems neither party is about that anymore. Its all about wealth transfers to the wealthy. The fight is just about which group of wealthy gets the spoils."
Pretty clear that the GOP has damaged its reputation badly since 2010. Dems were steady during that period. Itll be interesting to see if independent candidates can seriously cut into the two-party system in 2016. My guess is that it will take another couple decades.
"Means a lot less to me than it would have in 2008. Now Ive seen, after 5 years of the Obama administration, how little Democrats care for regular citizens as well. Sure most Americans will have health care soon, but that crowning achievement is mostly a win for private insurers and pharmaceutical companies. Hopefully it will lead to better things, but that seems like a long shot. Obama expanded unconstitutional mass surveillance on US citizens and gave himself the ability to unilaterally drone Americans to death without any due process. The stimulus wasnt bad, but it should has just been the start. Now our infrastructure degrades and were told there just isnt enough money to build roads and fix bridges ... meanwhile defense contractors keep filling their pockets and the oil giants continue to be subsidized. I guess Im mostly venting. The best thing that can come out of this data would be for a strong 3rd party to emerge which would disrupt the powers that be. "
"Im so sick of partisan bullshit. Being independent doesnt make me a confused Republican or a fairweather Democrat. The idiotic apologism in this thread is just revolting. I choose not to identify with either party because I dont believe either of them are genuine. They both have high-powered PR teams that waste a shit-ton of money trying to buy votes. Fuck them and fuck their brands. It they actually respected my opinion, they wouldnt have dedicated an entire marketing campaign to changing it. /rant Tl;dr Voting Republican or Democrat is like voting for McDonalds or Burger King. Partisan poitics is superficial and soulless like commercial marketing. Thats why people are independent."
Which is why we need instant runoff voting. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting Instant run-off allows third parties to exist without creating the splitter effect. If 42% of the electorate is independent then certainly we need more than just the Republicans and Democrats. 
"The US is crying out for a viable third party. Then the Democrats could be the middle party they really are, Republicans could reinvent themselves and jettison the crazy people holding them to ransom and people could have a viable choice between a right, left and middle. You think you know gridlock. Allow me to introduce you to Europe, my friends *evil laugh*"
"For those hoping this means we can get a third party, lets look at the numbers. Lets say there is a left leaning third party, which takes all of the left leaning independents (16%) and those that dont lean (12%), giving the third party 28%, Democrats 31%, and Republicans (who still get right leaning independents) 41%. If there was a right leaning third party you get third party 28%, Democrats 47%, and Republicans 25%. In either case the third party [spoils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect) the primary party they are most similar to, the least advantageous outcome for the independents. Doubt theyll make the same mistake again with results like that. We wont get a third party until we escape [Duvergers Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvergers_law). I suggest [Approval Voting](http://www.electology.org/approval-voting)."
"im listed as unaffiliated because i vote for people, not parties, but this also means i cant vote in the primary"
This doesnt mean as much as it might seem. Shifts in identification do not necessarily mean a change in actual opinion or voting habits. Often as a party becomes more and more unpopular the people that still subscribe to the beliefs of that part dont want the label of belonging to that party. So this might not mean there are any less Republican voters in the world. Just less people that want to be called republican. 
Thats because its *cool* to be Libertarian.
Just give us open primaries already. Youre taking votes away from people having closed primaries. It discourages unaffiliated voters.
Beautiful! Maybe we can stop with this Two-Party bull-shit sooner than I thought.

No surprise here. The GOP has been digging its grave for years.
And yet independents always vote Republican.
"What is wrong with those 42%? They must hate gay marital rights, or womens abortive rights, or minorities civil rights, or human rights, or the earth, or science, or equality, or else they would join the winning team. Idiots."
This doesnt mean shit. Their line of bullshit is still the same.. Most of these people hold the same beliefs they are just trying to divorce themselves from the shit show they supported for the past decade. 
And how was this survey went about. Surveys cant be trustworthy unless it takes out all other confounding variables.

"In related news a record number of democrats enrolled in unemployment and health benefit programs Edit: just realized the serious climate of discussion, no place for my partisan-based humor."
Vote for Bernie Sanders! And We the People might still have a chance.
"Theres no way this can be true, because I doubt that 42% of Americans know what an independent is. "
"This is such bullshit. Independents are just Republicans who are too ashamed to admit it or think their lack of Party affiliation is some grand testament to their impartiality, which of course is non-existent."
Of that 42% I bet you at the very least 75% of them vote democrat 95% of the time. So out of that original 42% of Independents between 32-34% of them are voting Democrat All The Time. Math baby.. Math. ;)

Hope my 3rd party absentee ballot vote isnt thrown away again like it was during the previous presidential election.
Hello madam president.....tea pubs and rest will insure her victory by not allowing nominee from middle. You can take that to the bank.
Excellent news. The founders warned against political parties from the very beginning of the republic. If we could get a fair debate system which is not controlled by party veterans that would be great. I registered independent last year and while I cant vote in a primary it was worth it.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) 2016! 
These floating independents arent really independents. They will return to the republicans once they get their shit in order. 
Still wishing for the Tea Party to actually schism and form an ultra right wing shit show.
"I hope my deregistering as an R helped that, even though I never really voted for them in recent years. "
"The more readily available the facts become to a more widespread audience(read: interwebs), the political power of the Republican party will continue to decline."
2016 will be a realigning election.
"Its more because of the tea party and those who deem the Republicans too liberal. Im no longer a Republican, but Ill likely never vote for a Democrat. Im more likely to go Libertarian next time."
"the GOP batshit crazy extremism of the last four years tastes like ass, marketingwise. who in their right mind could get enthusiastic about the new all corporate GOP? they forgotten how to pretend that they give a shit about the average American. Unless that average American is also an evangelical gun owner. "
More libertarians please.
Have we finally become tired of being categorized?
"Its so awkward having to interact with the lower classes, might as well tell them Im independent and perhaps they wont realize that my father is a top Republican contributor. After all, no one understands my life, except for maybe the brilliant Ayn Rand. "
Haha in my lifetime this is the lowest Ive seen of republicans.
Probably a loss of Democrats too considering how terrible the presidency has been.
We need all candidates to run as independents so people can decide on policy and not party affiliation.
"Aside from social issues, there is really little policy difference between present day Democrats or Republicans. It is time for a legitimate Third Party candidate to arise. edit* The down-voters really should pick up a Political Science text book..."
I could see the current political status quo fading. I hope this leads to a new party. A choice other than the left wing or the right wing. One in the middle. A moderate party.. a collection of congressmen/women who actually want to get some real work done.
Reddit rejoices!
If you identify yourself as a democrat you are still a republican. I have the past 2 presidencies to prove it
"simple, first we vote out the incumbent..."
"As a socialist, I always answer independent... cause thats basically become the blanket term for anything not Dem or Rep. "
"the sucky thing is that the disgruntled repubs are claiming to be libertarian - and theyre in total shock when they find out that libertarian is not a fancy word for republican, and REAL libertarians dont support the GOPs fascist theocratic beliefs."
Its time for a third party to swoop in. Funded by fairydust
Its an old demographic. Time is killing the GOP brand as much as the Tea Party.
"WHO FUCKING CARES? There is no Independent Party there is only Republicrats and Demicans - When youre in the voting booth you ONLY HAVE the lessor of these two evils to chose from... Both of whom are bought and sold long before they get on the ballot ... So start third, fourth and fifth parties or give up and vote for the Demican.... and dont even try to say that Libertarians have any chance, true Libertarians will never get elected to a high office... they are nuts; privatize EVERYTHING and OPEN BORDERS! What a disaster. The idea of Free Markets &amp; Libertarianism may be great on paper to some, but once you involve humans and Crapitalism (Thats Crony Capitalism to those of you in Rio Linda, CA) it all goes to hell."
Ahem....yea that may be me....makes me all tingly inside
I dont vote because my vote doesnt matter and I dont like anyone whos running.
Not surprising. The Republican brand is in the toilet. This Gallup poll is misleading. Majority of people when polled identify themselves as conservative more so that liberal more than 2 to 1. 
A lot of this is just republicans(and people) realizing people hate them so they relabel themselves independent while keeping the same rigid belief system.
"lol, muh disillusionment"
Time to get good ol Bernie Sanders elected!
"Thats because more than ever, people are identifying as libertarian (notice the small L)."
"Independents are, for the most part, people who only know of the three existing parties. Independents dont necessarily have an argument in any sort of political discussion because they dont really want to be affiliated with a ruling party. This basically means that almost half of the U.S. hates our current political system but are too ignorant to give a shit about making informed decisions. The constituents are apathetic and thats a shame."

"And here is the counter point that debunks this poll as flashy, but practically meaningless: Most political independents, arent: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/01/08/most-political-independents-actually-arent/"
"Honestly I think its because the parties are virtually indistinguishable. Now hear me out before you downvote. Im not saying that what each party purports to stand for is identical. Im saying that in action, leaders of both parties do virtually identical things. Theres no change when a new president is elected. Its just a continuation of policies regardless of party. Politics in this country has become lets attack them and make them look stupid! rather than anybody actually trying to solve any problems. People may speak about solving problems, sure. But nobody seems to ever *do* anything. That could just be my perception, of course. Edit: I no grammar good."
I love all the young-ins who think a third party will solve everything. All you will have is another party controlled by big money. It does not matter how many parties there are in this country. Until you can get money out of politics nothing will change. 
"Meanwhile, in another study, we learn the most independents are effectively democrats or republicans since they still tend to vote one way or another, seldom going in the opposite direction (albeit moreso than those who self-identify as democrats or republicans). If anyone can find that study Id appreciate it, Im a bit too busy to source it myself. It was released around the same time as the one were discussing in this thread. A lot of people who study politics believe that the true independent is an illusion, and that study would seem to support that. Politicians tend to group together based on their beliefs, and individual voters tend to have somewhat consistent believes as well, so it stands to reason that many voters will vote the same way most of the time, regardless of how they self-identify. Then again, Im by no means a politician so a lot of this info is just piggy-backing off of studies Ive read and political pundits. "
They have successfully purged the non-believers from their party. Good for them. 
"So does this mean that Democrats are more obstinate and Republicans are more Independent, or do people think that the Republicans are suffering from disillusion at the Tea Partys failure to unite the party under a common goal, or something else? "
le yes! take that fundies!
Independent is just another label than other 
No comments about declining liberalism?
"Without a parliamentary system, we only get two parties. The only option here for a third party is if the GOP shrinks to a point where an opportunity for a third party to replace them emerges. If that happens, it will be comprised of GOP moderates who have been purged from the current GOP. (See Whig party )"
"Ill bet that 40%, if not more of these independents have consistently voted either Democrat or Republican, their entire adult lives. "
More Republican-leaning voters are calling themselves independents than ever before.

"Doesnt matter what people identify as, it matters how they vote. Some people voted for Obama just because he was a celebrity. Some people did it just because it was the thing to do, everyone was doing it. I know a not-insignificant number of guys who became hugely vocal proponents of the Obama platform simply to impress girls around them who were also Obama supporters. Unfortunately, I think Nader is too old at this point. Actually, what the fuck am I saying, theres *no way* Hillary is *not* going to be the next president. Hillary/Villarigosa is where my money is."
Im a Republican delegate and dont even consider myself Republican. 
"I have a hard time believing that, especially after hearing a few times recently about how predetermined almost all seats in the House of Representatives are (if Im not mistaken it is about 180 democratic, 220 republican and only 35 up for grabs). And by tampering with the voting districts, this is probably just going to get worse. "

Shittiest graph colors ever.
Independent usually implies that you would consider voting Republican--thats just fucking stupid.
"Independents probably consist of people that merely have a grab-bag of ideologies from Democrats and Republicans, so that if median voter opinion effects law-making there is effectively no difference. If I had to guess, these people dont generally hold opinions that cannot be classified into the platform or at least the comfort zone of either one of the parties. In my head, on the *full* ideological spectrum, Democrat and Republican politicians range in difference from about 5 to 15 percent, depending on which two you choose to compare."

"Republicans seldom admit to being Republicans though. Im not a Republican, I just am pro-life, hate unions, gays, and the president and think we should cut taxes and listen to Jesus more. I realize there is a social conservative/fiscal conservative split to an extent in the GOP and that some fiscal conservatives consider themselves libertarians (although a true libertarian would also be socially liberal) but at the end of the day these people are voting Republican. I think the most telling fact is if someone refuses to work with the Democrats on any compromise ever. If they support Republican obstructionism then I feel like you pretty much MUST call them a Republican. "
Independents are just disenfranchised democrats that cant admit they are republicans yet.
"Im only 20, so I dont know if anything has changed, but all that I see is smear campaigns, and it makes me really fucking not want to identify with the party responsible for putting them up. From talks with my friends, they felt the same way. "
"This country is run by money. Voting doesnt even matter, unless youre voting for corporate interests. "
"Thats because 41.7% of Americans are stupid. Really in a two party system you have two choices in ours its between the Republican and a Democrat. Being independent means youre not taking part in the party politics which will determine which candidate you get to either vote for or vote against. Which means your voice is not being heard when it comes to picking your representative fully. How many of you would have preferred Kucinich to Obama in 2008? Well did you get out there and vote for Kucinich did you campaign for him? No you probably didnt but youll bitch and complain about Obama winning, why? What did you do to change it and fight for a candidate you would rather prefer? We live in a two party system and until that changes you can either take part or not take part. In primaries the difference between candidates is really slim which is where a strong organized group can make a difference. So yeah you can keep bitching like most people continue to do about politics or you can get active but if youre just going to keep bitching at least be a bit quieter about it. "
"ITT: People who dont realize that if they are cynical about the 2 existing parties, they probably would hate 3rd parties anyways as well. 3rd parties dont get smeared by their opponents in elections because they arent likely to win/be a threat. And humans, particular those in the US, are very susceptible to grass is always greener thinking -- that is to say they think a 3rd party candidate would be better than existing candidates. Would it blow your mind if I told you that some large percentage of the things both Obama and Bush have done were the BEST possible decisions that could have been made? Everyone is cynical and there is a public mood that things are worse than ever regardless of whether that is true and whether things are actually improving. That mood may be totally unjustified and a 3rd party candidate may turn out to be *worse* than the existing two partys candidates. Or they may turn out better. Or just the same. Of course after a few political cycles theyll be attacked by their political opponents so it shouldnt be long before you hate that 3rd party just as much as you hate the first 2. Im not against having more choices, and I would like to see the electoral process change to move away from this winner takes all stuff, but I wish people would stop deluding themselves into thinking being president is a simple job or that there are simple solutions to our problems.

"The real trick for these slacktivists would be to move to Alabama, Georgia and places with the worst representatives, to live there for years and vote them out. The way civil rights were passed for blacks involved people moving into these areas and talking to people and showing them a better way.

NOW LETS HAVE AN INTERNET PARTY!
Too bad 41% of Americans within that 42% still vote along party lines. Gary Johnson would have been far better than Romney or Obama.
hmm looks like 42 percent of americans are getting smart and starting to question the two party system... and its not democrats 
As a none American I dont get why people insist on only voting for the 2 main parties. Why arent they flocking to alternatives instead by now.
Because Republicans are making it embarrassing to be a Republican.
its also the lowest identification for democrats in 25 years (granted its been kind of stable for the past couple of polls)
Only ~60% of Americans even vote.
Get ready to say hello to the one-party system!!
"When people claim that most of these Independents are Right Wingers in Rugged Individualist clothing, I think it speaks specifically to the rise of modern Ron/Rand Paul-style Libertarianism, which has roped in more than a few former Lefties as well. There is a growing section of organic/homeopath/naturopath/yoga/new age/vegan Left that is getting led down the same anti-government, anti-MSM conspiracy path via supposed natural websites like NaturalNews and NaturalCuresNotMedicine that on the surface appeal to middle class urbanites, but also push anti-vaxx, anti-fluoride, anti-GMO rhetoric as anti-government click bait. People have figured out how to sell InfoWars/PrisonPlanet style paranoia to the Left. Its the same type of circular relinking echo-chamber that floods skewed and falsified stories alongside practical help on making a working compost bin. I think people in general are getting more bullshit anti-everything propaganda from these frauds and charlatans, and its feeding their egos to think they somehow see behind the curtain, that they are truly independent. But the only thing they are independent of is critical thinking. The fewer people in general who participate in mainstream politics, the easier it is for larger powers to manipulate the electorate, and the more captive eyeballs they get clicking on their faux outrage, the easier it is to spread anti-government propaganda. And the more people that distrust the government - the Peoples main vehicle for expression of will - the easier it is for corporate and religious constructs to dominate the process. They dont give a shit WHY you hate the government, they just want you to help vote it out of power."
Independent is such a cute way of saying nothing.
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS SICK OF THE BULLSHIT
"Republican **transmogrification** --&gt; Independent, still votes Republican. Democrat **transmogrification** --&gt; Independent, still votes Democrat. Its who they vote for that counts, not what they call themselves. "
Hopefully this is a sign that Americans are fed up with the two-party system.
"Im registered as an Independent, but I vote as far Left as possible. Your average Democrat is not far enough Left for me. I checked to see if my state has a Socialist Party, sadly it does not."
People realize the Democrats and Republicans dont represent them anymore. Time to vote Libertarian. 
Independents = embarrassed Republicans
"I voted for Ron Paul, twice. Im a staunch Socialist, I just liked that he was against the war and fucking up the Republican part :D. I vote Green or Peace &amp; Freedom during the general elections. I was forced to register as a Republican in order to vote for him, and I suspect many others were as well. I would have objected, but I dont really care for the Dems either."
"Its still not low enough, the number of those identifying as republican. "
"Perhaps America will have democracy in the future soon, too! You know, with more than two parties ever getting elected..... Wait, what am I saying? Itll never happen."
"Come to the libertarian party! Libertarians take all the great stuff from both parties under the common goal of freedom and smaller government. Dude, we got guns, drugs, and rock and rock. Join the third party already."

This story seems like another great reason for states to hold open primaries. Why should only a few people between each party get to choose candidates.
Doesnt make a bit of difference as long as the wealthy are still picking the candidates. They own whoever you choose to vote for.
just because someone doesnt call themselves a republican doesnt mean they arent insanely conservative.
Yet none of them have the decency to vote third party.
Please god let conservative males keep talking about what women should do with their bodies and how bad brown people are for our economy.
"Its far from being meaningful progress but its not to see people moving away from the primitive baboons on the right, if even in an exaggerated and poorly defined manner described herein. "
This is great news. Politics has become so diluted and convoluted Im glad people are realizing whats happening especially with corporate money in politics which I completely hate even though I know there might be some valid reasons for it but the cost is too high. I dont believe in political parties and instead vote based on facts and positions held by candidates. I hope everyone votes with a non-biased informed opinion. http://www.politifact.com/ &lt;--- This isnt the be all end all site but it certainly helps and gives real sources. I dont like to trust anything 100 percent but its pretty damn good. 
"Maybe its because of the bat-fucking-shit crazy far-right republicans whom are getting all of the press, you know, for being retarded."
Interesting coincidence but voter turnout is in the 50-60% range. There are as many people that do not vote as there are independents. I wonder how much of the two is overlap.
Haha Then why are the elections so close all the time?
"Republicans are dying off. Soon Texas will be Democrat like California, and they will not be able to elect a Republican to office."
As long as the number of Democrats is going down by any means necessary it cant be bad news.
Anyone who didnt see this coming didnt have eyeballs or ears... or a brain.
I AM INDEPENDENT EVEN THOUGH I ALWAYS VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS AND HAVE LIBERAL POSITIONS ON ALL ISSUES. PLEASE RESPECT MY RATIONALITY.
Dont be fooled; most of those independents are actually republicans in disguise. They hold all the same extreme right wing political views as their GOP brethren but don?t want to face the consequences and ridicule for their failed and outdated policies. Its political cowardice...
"wait, so we can vote for independents now? any interesting candidates?"
Now if only we could elect a non-Republican or Democrat.
If it walks like a duck...
"Now... If you could just get them to vote youd have something..,"
If we could just get some independent candidates this statistic might actually mean something.
And independent is what a Republican calls himself when hes single and wants to get laid

Heres Bernie Sanders only chance at the White House in 2016.
Americans understanding of the words Liberal or Independent = voting for the same republican or democrat over and over.
"Its not cool to be a Republican in the current climate. So people dont identify as such. Even more younger voters want to forsake traditional labels altogether. When given a choice between two evils, you will still get roughly half the population voting that way. It swings back and forth by a few percentage points depending on the political climate. Same as it has always been. It almost makes you think that people need to convince themselves theres a feasible third option... "
*Democrat identification lowest in at least 25 years.* No need to single out the republican party.
"If this is true, thanks to the republicans for widening the gap so far that the indies had to fill it in. At least the GOP did something right for the country. "
Unfortunately a lot of these new independents are right wing populist radicals
"As an independent, I think the worst thing for my political group is that we are lumped in with the Tea Party :( Fuck the Tea Party"
"Maybe the tide is slowly turning, and maybe people getting fucked in the ass without lube is finally starting to translate to some changes in general ideology. My apoplectic side says we still have a long way to go."
"I dont really care about or follow politics, therefore I am Independent."
Politicians are naturally opportunistic. At some point enough of them will realize that in between the socialists and the far right ideologues are a solid majority of rational moderates who are more interested in economic issues that unite us than the polarizing social issues that pols use to divide us. This will probably happen right after they get voted out of office. Do your part. Vote the bastards out. All of them.
"The independent voter is a myth. There have been other studies that showed that they only claim independence because they dont have agree entirely with one party, but still consistently vote for one party. "
"*Identifying as* and *being* independent are independent things. It may be the cool thing today so you seem intelligent and fair-minded, yet how many of these people are still registered Democrats or Republicans?"
"These poll results mainly show Republicans who are no longer willing to call themselves Republicans because of the beating the GOP brand has taken in recent years. But most of them will continue voting for the GOP as they have always done. A lot of Nazis did the same thing in the immediate aftermath of Germanys surrender in World War 2 -- tore off their uniforms and pretended they had nothing to do with the 4th Reich. I cant tell you how many Republicans tell me Im not a Republican! Im a conservative! (Unstated: But I still vote Republican in every election, and will never do otherwise!)"
Lifelong independent here. Spread the word -- you dont have to be one of the lousy two.. and always vote!
"nice misleading headline. not blaming the submitter (as that is the article headline), but i have no idea why gallup would use such an irresponsible headline for their article. the chart and article clearly shows that **democrats are at a 25 year low too**, yet the headline only mentions high independent numbers and low republican numbers. "
"Encouraging! BUT, seriously consider voting for someone other than a Dem or Rep in the next election. Yes, your vote will be wasted. However, your vote WILL BE noticed by those that do such things. We need to break the 2 party system in this country forced on us by the media and the 2 parties. Strike a blow for freedom, vote Libertarian. Actually, vote any party OTHER THAN Rep or Dem!"
perhaps we can get this third party going?........
When will the primaries be revised? In CT I cant vote in primaries since Im registered and vote as an independent?
"I consider myself an Independent, but a heavily anti-conservative Independent. If a genuinely liberal (in the U.S. sense) party appeared that did not kiss the ass of the oligarchs, I would vote for it in a heartbeat."
"Does it matter what they call themselves if they still consistently vote for a single party? I know anecdotal information isnt worth much, but nearly every independent Ive met has been a partisan that didnt want to be called a partisan. "
"They identify as Independents because the Christianist wing of the Republican party embarasses them, but when it comes time to vote or donate all of their money still spends Republican."
" Actually sounds like it used to be... a large group of conservative liberal centrists who dont identify with either extreme, and who simply wait and see which asshole politician tells the best and most believable lies. &lt;EDIT&gt; and so you downvote the truth... fucking morons."
"the GOP otherwise know as fox news, is completely out of touch with reality... just like corporations and the 1%... the GOP do nothing for regular people. they have no idea about what it means to make money to survive... rich people are always out of touch with regular folks."
Most of those independents are just glorified members of the Tea Party. 
I have been a registered Independent since I started voting 20 years ago. Put an end to the 2 party system and have congressional term limits and lobbying/corporate influence isnt nearly as organized and subsequently less effective. 
You mean some republicans are ashamed to say theyre republicans so claim to be independents. :)
Democrats must have taken a hit too. 
"I believe most of those people that shifted to call themselves independents will still vote republican and democrat when the time comes. They just dont want to wear the label right now because the brands have been damaged. They believe identifying as independent bolsters their viewpoints as more thought out and less blinded by party loyalty, nevermind that most didnt actually change their position on anything."
"I really need to actually change what Im registered as to an Independent, but EH"
"Is there any proof that simply changing to independent you will **not** vote for your previous affiliation? I dont buy it, if you vote Republican / Democrat in the past you will vote for them in the future. "

"America has, arguably, the most lax gun control laws in the world which makes it a stretch for most reasonable people to believe that anyones coming to take guns. Also, the NRA, like em or not, has pushed misinformation in an attempt to scare its members/consumers. Theyre making money off of your fear; thats a simple equation that works in power grabs and marketing (just think about Life Alert commercials). Selling guns doesnt rest on one marketing strategy."
"Well (a) if you are a member and (b) if you buy guns. Obviously they generate income from member dues but they also receive donations from over 50 gun manufacturers and firms. Last year, one of these firms paid the NRA a portion of its proceeds for each gun it sold. The NRA also makes money by doing round up promotions. They ask people purchasing guns to round their purchase up to the next dollar and all proceeds go to the NRA. How are they making money off of your fear? How about the surge in gun sales in 2011? Lapierre claimed that Obama will take guns away in his second term because, as a lame duck, hed have nothing to lose. The sales surge was a direct result of this fear mongering, that never came to fruition I might add, in the year leading up to his reelection. "
"Ok, I have to ask: if you recognize that a service you pay for has misled you (intentionally), do you not have a problem with that at all? Im specifically getting at whether or not you have any issue with instances of misinformation/deceit/manipulation from gun control organizations like Brady Campaign and Bloombergs 2 gun control organizations. Ill provide an example, the 40% lie. http://www.factcheck.org/2013/03/guns-acquired-without-background-checks/ &gt;Both of those statements were based on a single 1994 telephone survey on private gun ownership conducted by the Police Foundation and funded by the Justice Department. The survey asked the 251 participants who had acquired guns in the previous two years, ?Was the person you acquired this gun from a licensed firearm dealer?? The answer choices were ?yes,? ?probably was/think so,? ?probably not,? ?no/definitely not,? ?don?t know? and refuse to report. Cook and Ludwig found that 64.3 percent of those surveyed (Table 3.14) said that they had purchased or traded for a gun that came from a licensed dealer or ?probably? did. The 40 percent figure comes from assuming that the remaining 35.7 percent ? which has been rounded up ? did not. 65 percent said they did or probably did. They had to combine those who answered dont know, probably not, definitely not, and even those who refused to answer the question, **AND THEN ROUND UP TO THE NEXT 10!**. Not round up from 35.7 to 36, round 35.7 into 40."
"Great point but I dont subscribe to the Brady campaign or mayors against illegal guns, etc. thats the difference: Im not going to defend any group regardless of what they do.

"Yep, thats me. Stupid and on the government dole for years now. Unemployment, SNAP, subsidized housing, day care, supplemental security income, National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, Workers Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, Temporary Disability Insurance, and Veterans Benefits. To be truthful, I use some of **one** of those benefits. Not as much as I am allowed but a small amount. I wonder which one? I tried and tried to do well in my chosen profession but the man always kept me down. I want more though. After all, I am living in a red state and we all know how the red states eat up all of those fine government programs. Or, Im just another rich Republican who attained his wealth by ripping off the masses. You know, you really should not use the words efficient and/or improve quality when referring to government programs. It just doesnt make sense. Not experienced on how the government actually works are you? No experience in that field? You just take some liberal web sites word for it all? And the cuts Obama made was in one of the most favorite programs for seniors on Medicare. That would be the Medicare Advantage Program. From one of your links, Its possible enrollees in Medicare Advantage would lose some extras (you know, those nasty extras), but not basic Medicare coverage. Yes, the wonderful government basic stuff. I suppose similar to government cheese. It turns out the word perhaps should be done deal. That has actually happened. More efficient for the government means that they cut some benefits (the extra stuff) and pay providers less $$. That is the heavy hand of cost controls which creates shortages and longer waits for health care. You know, good old basic government type care. And you should not put this type of [nonsense] (http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/GOP_Extreme_728x300.jpg) when trying to make a point. I guess I could always put [this] (http://www.foxnews.com/) on for you to show da truth. They would privatize Medicare by creating competing private options giving seniors greater choice of healthcare plans. Hell, we all know that competition raises costs...right? If you want health care costs to go down the progressives will always go for government cost controls everytime. Again, imposing cost controls always, I will say again, always creates shortages and longer wait periods for health care. You know, I have never waited for a colonoscopy more days required for the prep time. In [Montreal, Canada] (http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/muhc-facing-colonoscopy-backlog-patients-told-to-look-elsewhere-1.1468377/comments-7.437934) the Canadian government is telling people to look elsewhere for a colonoscopy. Ah, the basic government stuff. Perhaps they should come to the good old miserable health care nation of the USA. Wait...2-3 days."
"I would not have a problem with young people opting out of health insurance, **if** they were willing to sign a fearsomely comprehensive waiver such that they also opted out of future medicaid benefits should a negative health event bankrupt them. As well as other social safety nets such as food stamps. Hospitals would be exempt from treating them under EMTALA when they show up at the E.R. without insurance. If you want act fearsomely independent -- fine -- but the rest of us should hold you to it. When you want to buy back into the system as a diabetic 55 year old then you be allowed to do so at an appropriate rate -- which by that time would be truly unaffordable. There is a reason why rates for someone purchasing life insurance at age 21 are lower than rates for someone who waits until age 65 to purchase life insurance. No one seems to dispute that. But for some reason we think that we should be allowed to go without health insurance for as long as we think we dont really need it (tra-lalah-lalah), and then buy it at for same rate as everyone else when we do need it... "

"And? Justices Marshall and Powell rarely asked questions, either. His personal preference is to let the lawyers argue the merits with each other and understand the points theyre trying to make. "
"Yes, I have read that Clarence Thomas quote. But its disingenuous bullshit. The court worked differently before the 20th century: &gt; The justices [say in the 19th century] did not ask many questions. But this was during the time before briefs were filed. Rather, the arguments were more like the British system where all arguments were presented right in open court. Thus, without briefs the justices had to listen to find out the arguments rather than try to clarify them from the briefs or inject their own thoughts. [citation](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/apr/16/clarence-thomas/clarence-thomas-gives-supreme-court-history-lesson/) In other words, Thomas is technically correct. A hundred years ago judges didnt ask as many questions. But thats because they didnt see the case beforehand and didnt have any questions prepared. Rarely asking questions, perhaps only a handful of times per season, might be excusable, but never asking a single question over multiple years? That is the behavior of someone who is simply not paying any goddamn attention."

The 90% survey you quote was taken in 3 states. A survey on an issue like gun control needs to have a sample taken from all states and include even samples from urban and rural areas. Statistics need quality samples to get unbiased results.
"Thats actually not accurate, many different polls, most of which were national polls which polled in every state, came up with between 86% and 91% support for background checks. The issue is the misleading question, and the fact that most people believe that to already be the law (which it is, we do require background checks from all FFLs, even at gun shows or online). Most people probably didnt realize they were talking about the idea of expanding background checks to private sales, because that wasnt mentioned in the question and lots of people are unaware of how private sales work. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/18/gabrielle-giffords/gabby-giffords-says-americans-overwhelmingly-suppo/ We must balance that with this poll which shows that less than half of the American public desire congress to pass any new gun control law: &gt;Americans are more narrowly divided on the issue than in recent months, and backing for a bill has slipped below 50%, the poll finds. By 49%-45%, those surveyed favor Congress passing a new gun-control law. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in early April, 55% had backed a stricter gun law, which was down from 61% in February. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/04/22/usa-today-poll-finds-support-for-gun-control-ebbs-backing-for-immigration-bill-strong/2103419/"

Minimum wage being frozen didnt cause the post 911 recession or the housing bubble collapse. 
"It may have been a factor in the collapse of the housing market. Lenders made up for income inequality by offering overly generous terms to unqualified buyers, creating a bubble. When the incomes of these buyers failed to rise as anticipated, a default crisis began. And the 9/11 recession was well underway before 9/11/01: http://origin.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2012/06/MonthlyJobs.png"
"Unemployment has gone down everywhere. The average income in our state, however, has fallen dramatically. Who cares how many people are working when we still make less money? And no-one toting this surplus can give me a link. The only .gov related information Ive seen (as far as I understand) shows that most of our impending debt was deferred until later, not actually being paid off. This accrues greater interest payments and makes this surplus simply a forced budget adjustment that comes at a greater cost down the line. Edit: here you go: http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Miscellaneous/Documents/2013_10_15%20Structural%20Deficit.pdf The Legislative Fiscal Bureau finds that the deficit is not created by austerity measures, but by taxes rising faster than expected.

If you would have answered my question you would have seen the point. These account for **all federal money** that is being spent in that State. This includes bases and federal infrastructure. The Lions share of bases are in the South. Its not as if all southern states are broke and require money to operate. The federal government is spending money on federal government things and then articles like these are spinning it to make it a divisive issue of southern states taking more money.
"6 million people lost their policy as a result of changed mandated by the ACA. Less have currently signed up for coverage. There are less people with health insurance today than there was a year ago. edit: Sure, go ahead and downvote facts"

Many did, and those are off-exchange enrollments--enrollments that are entirely outside of the numbers were totalling.

Thats the part of me that like to believe 100% evil doesnt exist. The other part feels like they made the opportunity and didnt give a fuck what happened. In that case 9/11 was just very convenient, and removed the necessity for any subtlety. The first thing that snapped me out of my prolonged shock being a New Yorker at that time was reading the word Iraq on the cover of the Post. My first thought was, You sons of bitches. Went back to being my old cynical self after that and my temporarily enhanced sense of patriotism melted. Halliburton showers electrocute GIs and contracted spooks leak secrets.

There is a much larger difference in self reported gun ownership rates between rural and urban areas, gun ownership and thus exposure is much higher in rural areas.

"Since corporations are not creating jobs despite glomming unprecedented profits now, lowering the minimum wage will not magically entice them to create more jobs or stop sending them overseas. "
"The $4 minimum wage would be subsidized by the government (making it really 8 dollars an hour). That sounds like a horrible, horrible idea on so many different levels I might end up creating a daily blog just to list them all. To begin with these workers already make $7.25- and end up needing government assistance in order to survive. Giving them a 75 cent raise will not remove the need for government to intervene and continue to give them assistance. All it would do is give more welfare to large corporations and leave the workers in the exact same position. Furthermore this will not create many jobs at all, if anything it may end up HURTING the economy and cause unemployment to go up. A Mc Donalds or a Walmart will not simply hire more employees if they have to pay them less. They will hire employees based on the amount of demand or workload that exists. If a local Mc Donald has 5 full time employees they will continue to have 5 as those 5 workers have already met the demand. Profits will be pocketed and the workers will see none of it. "

Lowering the minimum wage kills jobs, only raising the minimum wage can increase jobs by adding more money into the market, creating more demand, requiring more jobs. "
"Once the debt ceiling is reached, the federal government is no longer able to issue debt (that is, borrow from investors by issuing bonds and notes). That?s predicted to happen in mid-October . At that point, the government would have a little breathing room to send out payments ? it could use the cash it already had on hand, plus any new revenue it received in the interim. But that cash supply is not expected to last beyond Nov. 1 at latest. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/oct/13/ten-questions-about-debt-ceiling/ "
"We can, we will. Taxes were still coming in to the treasury. That is why this article is so silly. America wont default unless YOU stop paying taxes, or we quit printing money. Its that simple. "
"See here for facts: http://www.justfacts.com/socialsecurity.basics.asp Govts worldwide omit the issue by raising retirement age: every day somebody works is a day of not paying benefits out, which is a double win for s.s. budget. But even assuming advances in medical technology, old people will not quite be able to work for the most part. Hence FICA/equivalent rates will have to increse. Theyre 33% in Italy now they will only grow. Perhaps its sustainable but it will be creaking: how many jobs will remain in legal and not underground economy if FICA approaches 50%? So: 1. its early retirement funded into old age for the ss newcomers 2. so so retirement for a few years for current workers 3. work till you drop dead or at best measly fraction of what you paid in for todays children. Theoretically, if ceteris paribus applies (productivity, econ growth, current or better reproduction rates) its sustainable. But probably it isnt, due to what I paid in is mine give it to me back dammit mentality: this will bulge debt higher and higher (as net losers will demand in hotter and hotter terms of getting at least 100% of what they paid in, thus increasing rates in the future) into closer and closer future, counting now as 20-30 years from now. The political stress will probably break it up."
"how difficult it is to pinpoint ss nature is demonstrated by this: http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/09/social-security-0 Thats the truth, but not the whole truth. While projected benefits might be sustainable in total quantity ceteris paribus, that masks the basic problem: that individual rate of contributions to benefits hes likely to get given his probable longevity turns from incredible (look up how much Ida May Fuller got for her contribution) to break even to negative. Thats where the snag is: in classic Ponzi scheme investors are defecting because they realize this thing is not sustainable given faith of other people. In legalized, multi-generational pay as you go (wage tax for current worker =&gt; retirement of former worker) the whole thing will turn unsustainable after returns turn negative, which is now. I have calculated using data from Urbain Institute that the turning point is about now for most groups and for some groups (high earning single males) were past that point. It wont be detection of fraud that will break ss, it will be politics of people hating ss because they will get less than they paid in - because the grudging acceptance of the scheme among the people relies mainly on perceiving it as retirement fund (I paid in dammit, Im entitle to get at least my contributions out). The number of links you posted does not prove that ss is not a legalized pyramid scheme that is unsustainable (if classic ponzi term is too offensive to you), its only that so many people grow desperate about the future of this system, because people doing cold financial math conclude its sustainability is at least in danger: http://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2008/fs080528.cfm"
"Thats because this would make rate of return for current middle age workers and future retirees worse, and those workers vote too. See thats the satanic nature of Ponzi scheme: those in the middle have vested interest in keeping mum about incoming insolvency and trying to roll the debt over onto newcomers, or else they lose even more or everything. Thats how pyramid keeps growing, of course until the point that everyone loses faith in it."
"Whether ss is a ponzi scheme or not depends on which characteristics you look at. It certainly has not been result of fraud practiced by single criminal, that is: ss is legal. However, financially it has characteristics of a chain latter/financial pyramid: first win big, middle break even, last lose. see e.g. here: http://www.economist.com/node/975689"

"I like your comment, I wish I had only labeled it,this is the veil that Snowden pulled back because I do feel that his actions have uncovered a lot more issues than NSA Surveillance and by judging whether or not he is a criminal is not the issue. "
"Heres an unpopular question. In the midst of all the outrage, did anyone noticed that the most alarming claims Snowden made have already been retracted or debunked? http://www.businessinsider.com/washington-post-updates-spying-story-2013-6 http://www.zdnet.com/the-real-story-in-the-nsa-scandal-is-the-collapse-of-journalism-7000016570/ http://thedailybanter.com/2013/06/nsa-story-falling-apart-under-scrutiny-key-facts-turning-out-to-be-inaccurate/?utm http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/08/cooperation-methods-protected-innocents-from-prism/ http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/42138_CNET_Says_NSA_Admits_Listening_to_US_Phone_Calls_-_but_Thats_Not_What_the_Video_Shows http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/jul/08/lynn-westmoreland/phone-call-surveillance-policy-no-mystery-congress/ http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/nsa-media-hysteria-misses-the-mark/21922 http://news.yahoo.com/5-ways-nsa-leaker-edward-snowdens-story-isnt-115500971.html http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/nsa-media-hysteria-misses-the-mark/21922 http://newsbusters.org/node/5319 http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/157713-making-sense-of-the-nsa-prism-leak-as-the-real-details-emerge?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ziffdavis%2Fextremetech+%28Extremetech%29 http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/nsa-prism-story-overhyped/ http://thedailybanter.com/2013/07/a-stellar-wind-primer-what-exactly-are-we-talking-about-regarding-the-nsa/"
"Snowden should not simply be considered a hero nationally, but internationally. Im Canadian and I feel hes done a service for not only America, but for the entire world."
"The more that comes out, the scarier it gets. Happy to see public opinion shifting."
"No, he should be a criminal. And nearly all of our electred representatives agreed that he should be a criminal. And he is a criminal. "
Agreed!
I think he isnt regarded as a hero *yet* because the vast majority of the American population hasnt a clue the scope of what the NSA has done. 
"I dont know why reddit insists on honoring Snowden as a hero. Yes, the NSA surveillence was bad. But at the same time, Snowden escaped to some of our biggest enemies and gave them our secrets, which technically makes him a traitor. If you really, absolutely have to worship a hero why dont you worship one of billion whistleblowers that didnt give secrets to our enemies? "
"Hes the peoples hero, not the governments, which is why they dont like him very much. Unfortunately our ideals have become very different over the years."
"Theres a huge difference between gathering all possible information on an identified person or people, and a sweeping catch-all of everybody to put into a filter. The first one is law enforcement and prevention. The second is a surveillance state and a terrible thing."

Imagine an entire crowd of people turning their backs on those whove turned their backs on the constitution. Lets see the police pepper spray someone standing there, for the simple reason that they are facing the other way. "
Snowden/Manning 2016!
"Hard to consider someone running to another country as a hero.. I wonder if he were analyzed, would he be shown as nothing more than innocuous employee that has aspirations of grandeur in his career/life that he perceives as going/went nowhere or was insufficient for his ego."
"Its a SCARY thing, and quite frankly if you can find older german people that are still living and can remember how Gestapo and SS would track people and information, then they will tell you what this kind of information gathering and wire tapping can lead to. Hell, you can read about it in history books."
"Snowden IS a national hero. The only ones who consider him a criminal are the Tyrannical monsters whom he publicly embarrassed and who are (ironically) themselves, criminals."
"He should be neither, actually. We knew about all this stuff already. Or perhaps we just have a shockingly short attention span?"
"Oh, how far the Patriot Act has come. /wavebye@rights"
"Why not both? Our government prefers it that way, so fine. Looking forward to his inevitable trial, as myself and everyone within 500 miles of it will be protesting the everloving shit out of the injustices our country has been trying to level at us."
"I praised Snowden as a whistleblower when his focus seemed to be revealing to American citizens the extent to which their own government was spying on them, but lately it seems his focus has shifted to revealing details of foreign intelligence gathering and releasing anything which will hurt the United States standing with the rest of the world, presumably to curry favor with other nations. That pushes him squarely into the traitor category, in my opinion."
"OP whats up with your stupid headline on an otherwise great submission? &gt;Editorialize titles of your link submissions, or they may be removed. **Your headline should match the articles headline, or quote the article to accurately represent the content of your submission.** Sidebar ------&gt;"
"There should be a law - and Im surprised there apparently isnt one already - that makes it perfectly legal to divulge classified information if such informatiom reveals illegal and/or unconstitutional activities. I recall how the only one imprisoned over the torture programs of the Bush administration was John Kiriakou, the guy who blew the whistle on them. Its disgusting. And the most frustrating part for me is that there isnt a damn thing I can do about it. I can sign wethepeople petitions until the sun explodes or vote differently next election, but I think the government has become so dependent on the dark side of politics that its never going to give it up."
This actually means something coming from the Economist
Its honestly inspiring to see polls now shifting drastically towards the majority of Americans thinking the same thing. Im proud there are sites like reddit here that bring light to issues the major news networks are too fucking scared to do more than mention.
"I might be just ASKING for downvotes, but I always thought that when you went to work at the NSA or similar places that you signed a contract that explicitly stated that you were not to disseminate information and that if you did it was punishable with &lt;insert punishments here&gt;. I agree with the whole Snowden did the right thing and that we as a people had a right to know those things, but he still did violate contract and should be held accountable for what he signed up for, should he not? Correct me if Im wrong, I just think he did a great thing, but should still have to face consequences for the breach of contract. Maybe Im just too letter-of-the-law? EDIT: Found a good source that cleared up a lot of my questions http://mises.org/daily/6474/The-Ethics-of-Whistleblowing"
"I lived abroad for many years just after the patriot act was signed. I can tell you that our citizens abroad have felt the demoralization this act has subjected us to more than US citizens living in America. As a US Citizen living abroad, you feel more trapped and with less liberties than you would living in the USA. Its horrific. The number of US citizens giving up their US citizenship has quadrupled in the past 4 years. "
I dont get why reddit is all over this guys nuts. He stole classified documents from the government and made them public. Hes a criminal and should be prosecuted. How can our government function if we let people get away with stealing and spreading classified information?
freedom isnt free buddy!
Its cool that he did all that...but he did sign a contract and he did violate the terms of the contract so....
...a parallel Supreme Court... Dark horizons ahead.
America! FUCK YEA. Freedom is the only way yeah.
"What a good point. I do understand that what he did was illegal and I hope that it does not hurt people abroad, because sometimes things like this are easily taken out on those not protected by our borders. But, that doesnt mean I think what he did wasnt right. I hope he has opened our eyes to just how much Americans have given up and how un-free we actually are becoming."
"You know the stuff he leaked was not really leaked but available to the public via internet, right? If not, go back under that rock you are hiding under and stay there please."
"At this point, how can ANYONE still believe the lies? You know, as a tech person before I thought surveillance on a national scale let alone global was impossible because of the resources and man hours. Now I am even more well-endowed with knowledge with the added fact that paranoia has sunken in. WAKE UP."
"Samal Edamaruku. Do you know his name? I do. Hes the one who debunked the crying Jesus statue by proving it was a leaky septic drip. Look at what happened to him for exposing the truth? If theres one thing people dont like, its the truth. Do you really think Atheists are reviled by Christians for not believing in God? Theyre afraid that sound logic may dissuade their entire system. "
I do think he has some confidentiality breakages when it comes to his former employer but from a legal standpoint he sure needs to not be treated like a spy unless he actually revealed inappropriate information to our enemies with the explicit purpose of damaging our national security. 
"&gt;They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety. Putting aside what Benjamin Franklin had to say on the topic for a moment: I have yet to see any evidence that all this intelligence gathering (invading?) actually increases safety. For instance, the reason for the airport scanners, the underwear bomber, was known to be plotting something, [but they didnt even put him on the no-fly list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Farouk_Abdulmutallab#Awareness_by_US_Intelligence). Or the most recent attack in Boston. Sure they had he and his brothers phone records and internet history, but did that prevent the attack? And, again, [they had been warned about the kid and the trouble he was likely to start](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/06/10/patriot-act-author-sensenbrenner-data-mining-led-to-missed-signals-in-boston-bombing). And now that the civil government is working on prosecuting and building a case against the remaining brother, will the NSA release that data to help in prosecution? Theyve made it clear the answer is no. So collecting the data doesnt protect anyone. Nor can it be used after the fact to help with prosecuting (thats assuming there actually is legal case brought forward). Oh, by the way, were all paying for all this equipment and staffing, and for what exactly? What are we getting back in return for our money and lost liberties? It sure isnt a little temporary safety.

"Its surprising that we can embrace fictional characters that serve as whistle blowers, but chastise those in reality. Snowden, Manning, and others might not be heroes, but should be exempt from any criminal action at the very least. "
"Its revealing to look at who calls him a criminal and who calls him a whistleblower. All one need do is open ones eyes, the answers are right in front of you."
Hes neither. He is a complete dumbass and that is all
I dont think it matters either way. They are still going to spy on people whether he said something or not.

"Why are we still talking about Snowden? Every day when I log onto Reddit and see the giant self-congratulatory circlejerk that is Snowden, I get discouraged. I see twice as many posts about Snowden as I do about what constitutes a search, our 4th amendment rights, national and international spying, and outsourcing of our intelligence agencies. Doesnt that bother you all, or are you too busy telling yourself youre actually doing something by posting a Washington Post opinion piece about how much of a fucking hero Snowden is? Fuck Snowden, who cares? Your rights are being obliterated and all you care about is whether he is extradited. Let me break this down for you: no one in power is browsing fucking Reddit. No one is looking at your post, or reading your comment. No one gives *two fucks* about what you do here. You think sites like Reddit are making a difference? Fat fucking chance. How many of you have called your senator or representative? How many of you have marched? Im sure some of you have, and kudos. The rest of you - please, please, *go outside and protest.* Get off Reddit. Youre not making a difference, youre masturbating each other and feeling *awesome* about it."
"Democracy is a very poor choice of words and the distinction is vital, our democracy isnt being limited, our liberty is being limited. Liberty itself means a lot of different things for people as well. A libertarian, I would think, would be most concerned with the freedom from compulsion, and a strong sense of individual responsibility. A lot of liberals focus liberty towards egalitarianism. My definition is much more specific, I want to forever be non-dependent from other peoples choices. The USs security apparatus on a core level violates all definitions and every law, ever piece of data further degrades our liberty. However, the United States is the leader of the free world, we have responsibilities to the world, and one of those is the protection of both US citizens, and citizens of our allies. We have a very large target on our back, and so programs such as this will always exist. There is a reason that there isnt one industrialized country in the world that doesnt have an extensive security infrastructure, the threat is real. Look at the 20th century, two world wars, and the rise of the two most evil philosophies, nazism and communism. You know, you can almost point to the very second in history when the United States took the torch from Britain, it was 02/21/1947 when British diplomats came to DC and called a meeting with the State Department and gave us too problems. Greece was in a civil war and the Greek royal family was very much loosing to the communist-led, Soviet backed, rebels, and it was well known that if Greece fell, Turkey was going as well. Britain just couldnt handle the situation any more and handed over the keys to the Empire. Truman went to congress, asked for a check for $400 million and handed it to Greece. The cash restarted their economy and saved the region from communism. We just dont remember how close the entire continent of Europe, minus Britain, was from being gobbled up by communism. France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey, all had massive food, and fuel shortages. The people were looking for anything to save them and Truman made George Marshall his Secretary of State, and gave him one job. Rebuilt Europe. None of this would have happened if we had argued this in the public domain, people were tired after WWII. George Marshal once gave a speech to congress, probably one of the most famous of his post WWII. Why must the United States carry so great a load in helping Europe? The answer is simple. The United States is the only country in the world today which has the economic power and productivity to furnish the needed assistance. The six and eight-tenths billion proposed for the first fifteen months is less than a single month?s charge of the war. To be quite clear, this unprecedented endeavor of the new world to help the old is neither sure nor easy. It is a calculated risk. It is a difficult program. And you know, far better than I do, the political difficulties involved in this program. But there?s no doubt whatever in my mind that, if we decide to do this thing, we can do it successfully. And there?s also no doubt in my mind that the whole world hangs in the balance as to what it is to be. The United States spent $15 billion in 6 years in 14 countries. Not one of them fell to communism. For 60 years the US, as the worlds leader has successfully kept another world war from happening, and for 50 years we held back the iron curtain. Here is the real kicker, and here is why I believe we have let the NSA got so far out of hand, the US (and the west in general) in all its economic power and military might is ultimately powerless against radical islam, they dont have a home base where we can line up against. We cant buy them off, they simply use the money against us. They use are very weakness against us, our freedom. We simply took some of that weakness away, let us hope we can one day take it back. "

Huh? Didnt his Justice Dept just issue a statement about curtailing the drug war? The feds have certainly been pretty hands off here in CO.
"Good sir, you bring up a good point! However, why you say cannabis opposition, do you mean allowing a record number of dispensaries to remain open in both percentage and raw numbers? Do you mean his deprioritization of marijuana prosecution [starting in 2011](http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2011/12/holder_federal_interference_in_medical_marijuana_a.php)? Do you mean his [averting minimum sentencing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/holder-seeks-to-avert-mandatory-minimum-sentences-for-some-low-level-drug-offenders/2013/08/11/343850c2-012c-11e3-96a8-d3b921c0924a_story.html) for low-level drug possession? Do you mean his promise kept to [send first-time nonviolent drug offenders to rehab](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/414/send-first-time-nonviolent-drug-offenders-to-rehab/) (which subsequently resulted in 120,000 people going into treatment instead of prison every year)? Because the only thing I can see when people say Obama opposes cannabis are a bunch of dispenaries close that were breaking regulation and would have been closed even if pot was legal at a federal level, like [this one](http://safeaccessnow.org/downloads/BPG_Forfeiture_Complaint.pdf), which republicans are using to prove Obama has broken his promise, when clearly they were acting illegally. "
"Whats your problem? Why dont you follow up on his promises? 2011, heres articles from the HufPo and RS dated in 2012 saying that the raids have been increased under Obama. Ill find other sources if these wont work for you. [HP](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/25/obama-marijuana-raids-rolling-stone_n_1451744.html) [RS](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obamas-war-on-pot-20120216) Promise promise promise. Thats all it takes to appease people like you. You wont even check up on him with his promises and take his word."
"And NSA contractors receive no whistle-blower protection, regardless."
" &gt;Thankfully he was smart enough not to go through that bullshit so that the American people got a better glimpse of how corrupt the federal government is So are you under the impression that the only way he could have released the information was if he fled, because thats not correct. There is no question that Snowden broke the law, his refusal to accept the consequences of his actions is what bothers a number of people. That you somehow think that his fleeing was *necessary* to effectuate the leaks suggests that you dont know what youre talking about. "
"&gt;legal wordplay. Considering that the only protection that could be offered to him results from legal wordplay that is the only thing Im actually talking about. You would be wise to note that in my post I did qualify what I wrote with under the law, so your post doesnt really add anything to the discussion. "
"Snowden had to know that going through the proper channels would not lead to change, aside from the termination of his career. He had NSA whistleblowers William Binney, Thomas Drake, and Russ Tice to thank for that foresight. It is true that in 2012, Obama added new whistleblower protections that did not exist when Binney, Drake, and Tice worked for the NSA. However: &gt;All the experts we have talked to were more than eager to acknowledge that Obama has done more to protect whistleblowers than any other president before him. But national security whistleblowers represent a glaring exception. The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than any president before. &gt;Additionally, Obama didnt manage to get whistleblowers access to jury trials, which was part of his original promise. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/426/increase-protections-for-whistleblowers/ I will also note that saying Snowden followed no such procedures, hence, under the law, he is not a whistleblower is shortsighted, and it seems that you may have fallen victim to legal wordplay. A whistleblower is a person who exposes misconduct, alleged dishonest or illegal activity occurring in an organization. The definition exists, notwithstanding any laws designed and enacted in the attempt to narrow or change the meaning. Hes a whistleblower, plain and simple."
"This is unfortunately true, and as I understand it, he claims he tried to go through the proper channels but got nowhere. The system doesnt work."
Do you have an example of the American government killing a citizen for possessing classified information or are you just espousing some kind of baseless conspiracy? 
"The Whistleblower Act requires that you follow a specific set of procedures in order to receive protection under the Act. Snowden followed no such procedures, hence, under the law, he is not a whistleblower. "
Do you suppose that following procedure results in much discussion or change at those levels?
[deleted]
"I have no idea, my point is that, legally, Snowden isnt a whistleblower because he didnt follow the proper procedure. Whether that procedure is good or useful to change is a totally separate matter that should be examined by Congress. "
And if he followed those procedures he would be either jailed or been put in a dark hole courtesy of the intelligence community. Thankfully he was smart enough not to go through that bullshit so that the American people got a better glimpse of how corrupt the federal government is. 
"Snowden did what he die because he knew that the The Whistleblower Act did not work for NSA. There have been many other whistleblowers in NSA who did follow channels (William Binney, J. Kirke Wiebe, Edward Loomis, Thomas Andrews Drake and Russ Tice). "
That the law is inadequate is a separate argument from whether Snowden fell under the laws aegis. 
"That particular set of procedures basically equating to send it to someone who will bury it, and prepare your anus for corrective penetration. See: William Binney, Thomas Drake, etc. Awesome set of laws, those whistleblower protections."
"Who was he going to tell? As far as he knew it went all the way up to the President. Theres no superior to the President but the American people, which is who he told."
Damn that sucks mine has been going down the past two years. Finally got the letter that it went up simply because of Obamacare 
"Yes, since they werent going up before 2008 at all! Oh whats that, theyve always gone up and theres no way to say for sure that the ACA is driving costs upwards? http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/15/ron-johnson/obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-havent-gone-do/ "
I cant wait until the employer mandate kicks in after the next election and the rest of you can suffer under obamacare. Prices will go up! Just because you get insurance from your employer does not mean you are safe 
"Spoiler alert: Prices will always go up. **Always**. Legislation, restrictions, requirements...none of that matters. Premiums will constantly rise because the population constantly increases. As the population increases, the number of people that file claims increase, thereby commanding higher premiums from healthy people to make up the difference."
Little secret in economics: there is no such thing as trickle down theory. 
Remind me how social security is working out...

Reagan destroyed the paradise that the US was under Jimmy Carter.....?!?
The USA went from being the worlds largest lender nation to the worlds largest debtor nation under old Dutch. His trickle down theories were and are disastrous. 
"I would love to see some defense for that statement because we were running deficits long before Reagan. You can harp on him for spending too much, or for spending too much on the military, but lets not just make up facts. Im going to assume youre critiquing Reagan as a liberal and not a tea-party budget hawk. Why are you upset about deficit spending when we were in a recession. Unemployment hit double digits in 1982. A liberal prescription for such an economy would be to rack up a large deficit."
"I agree 100% on the issue of trickle down, or trickle on as we like to call it where everyone downside gets a shower of gold. However the debt is on the head of the Democrats . Reagan certainly could have vetoed the bills had he wished but all the spending originated in the House of Representatives. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Presidents_and_control_of_Congress) Reagans party never had control of the House of Representatives. Thus every dime of debt was caused by the actions of the Democratic party. Now I suppose Reagan could have done more but there were reasons he didnt, he was fairly liberal and the kind of ideological gridlock we have now was yet in its infancy. It was not socially acceptable especially during the cold war. Also historically the US basically cant balance a budget most of the time. The eagerness of the federal government to expand programs far outstrips our ability to raise revenue. Its not a coincidence that in the last 50 years, only 5 budgets were balanced. [Source](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/may/07/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-balanced-budgets-rare/) and that if [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/politics/balanced-budget/index.html) is to be believed, we may never have a balanced budget again. And in case any Europeans ask why dont you raise taxes there are three reasons we really cant have a welfare state #1 Super high military spending #2 High immigration #3 Lack of social comity. The last kind of requires an explanation, each society has a certain level of corruption and sense of we are in this together The US has too much corruption and too little sense of togetherness to support European taxation levels. Even if you could get enough votes to force them, people many of whom have studied the issue will find as many ways to avoid paying. Its entirely possible that people would cease economic activity making it harder to gain revenue. If [Hausers Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauser%27s_law) is factual and it seems to have some merit within 10-20% or less margin, the effective Federal revenue is limited by the size of GDP and more importantly the distribution of it which of course in a Trickle On economy means the people most adverse to paying taxes often with the least need end up with all the revenue. Trying to keep the Federal leviathan operating thus requires borrowing or minting insane sums of money something that may not be sustainable. "
And yet hes still worshipped by the Right like he was the second coming of Lincoln.
Yes Reagan (a president elected 30 years ago) is responsible for the economic mess our pour current president is trying his hardest to fix and bears no responsibility for its failure. Jeesh.
Do you have any reputable sources on how/why trickle down economics failed? Ive never really read much into it but would like to!

&gt; The false promises? Another myth continued on reddit http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/
I never thought he was a good candidate. He was just the least terrible one.
"He never needed to be a good candidate. He just needed to better McCain and Romney, which proved simple. "
Shut the fuck up what were people supposed to realistically do?
"Name a single candidate, that will ever actually have a chance, that offers more than false promises."
Obama looked like a good candidate up until the moment that he received the Democratic nomination. Before that point he was fresh and optimistic. The last time I remember seeing him in such a light was a video of him giving a pep talk to his team back stage (right before or after he was nominated). After winning the nomination he just became part of the machine of Democrat/Republican politics. Personally I think Palin should have been elected so wed have an excuse to tear it all down and start over ;)
"At least for me, he wasnt a good candidate. He was just the best of the worst candidates. He was the proverbial diamond in a turd."
But but but... freedom! 
Who was that pornstar that ran for interim CA governor?
They worked on me sadly
"Well, whatever made you think Obama was a good candidate before? The false promises?"
Because we didnt know the promises were false!
"What are you saying. The Democratic Party voted and advocated against Civil Rights and MLK himself was a Republican.. Edit: in regard to the downvotes, the truth gets in the way doesnt it? "
"Places were never actually swapped. Republicans hold the same views as before but its the Democratic Party that has changed strategies by offering free hand-outs to African Americans, Latinos, etc in exchange for silent consent and a constant voter base. Edit: downvote party baby whoohoo"
Thats what he is saying. Look at the Southern Strategy. Understand that the Democrats to day were the Republicans from the 60s back. They swapped when the civil rights movement peaked.
"If you look at the votes in Congress for the Civil Rights Act of 64 and the Voting Rights Act of 65, you see that both parties were split along sectional lines. Northern Democrats and Republicans joined forces against Southern Democrats and Republicans. Of course King was a Republican, but he was willing to negotiate with Democratic administrations. It wasnt yet the hyper-partisan country we live in today."
"Yeah, sure... fifty fucking years ago. That matters, if you ignore the massive party shift that happened in the 1960s."
"&gt;King was under FBI surveillance for several years (until he died) due to his ties with communist organizations throughout the country. King accepted money from the organizations to fund his movements. In return, King had to appoint communist leaders to run certain districts of his SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership Conference), who then could project their communist ideas to larger audiences. A federal judge in the 60s ruled that the FBI files on King links to communism to remain top-secret until 2027. Senator Jesse Helms appealed to the Supreme Court in 1983 to release the files, so the correct bill in the Senate to create the Martin Luther King Federal Holiday could be abolished. He was denied. --from [Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/history/american/mlking.asp) The Democratic Party in the South definitely maintained the Jim Crow laws, but the Republicans did the same."
"the SOUTHERN democrats voted against civil rights, which is what drove them to the republican party. MLK was a Republican in the spirit of the FORMER republican party, before it gotten infected with racism."

"&gt;Does this deny him a right to trial? Yes, when youre a terrorist and become an enemy of the state, then national security trumps rights you think you get to keep. Its the same domestically as well. If youre holding a hostage, then you will often be shot and killed if there is no other means to subdue you. &gt;Barack Obama said Fast and Furious began under the Bush administration. Politifact rates this false. Fast and Furious started 9 months into his Presidency. Same program, different name. The point being that it was an adaptation of an initiative instituted under Bush. An initiative aimed at fighting the drug war which was revised and adapted after Obama took office. It was essentially a scenario where this was a plan that the ATF was using for years and Obamas administration decided to see those tactics through to fruition, instead of abruptly uprooting years of efforts. The point still remains that this is not Obamas brain child or his initiative, but one of the previous administration. &gt;Does this annul President Obama of any wrong doing because it was happening before he was elected. It continued after he was elected and he defends the program. He also extended the Patriot Act so he doesnt get points off for that either. It doesnt mean he deserves the blame for it, especially since hes curtailed it. The fact of the matter is that for nearly the past decade our national defense and national security has been built off of systems set forth and enabled through the Patriot Act. It would be highly irresponsible, inefficient, and a risk to national security to suddenly undue years of infrastructure that our intelligence network and defense now relies upon. It is much better and sager to taper our dependence on that infrastructure created by the Patriot Act and phase it out over time. His 4 year extension is exactly that and it only extends 3 provisions of the Patriot Act. So he actually deserves credit for taking the initiative in reducing the infringements of the original bill, thus giving us time to wean off of it. "
"&gt;NSA has been around for decades and it was actually the Patriot Act that empowered it to infringe the rights Americans criticize it for today. As a matter of fact, Obama increased public oversight over the NSA. Exactly. The Bush Administration laid down the bricks and Obama merely put them together (and/or left what Bush &amp; friends put into place intact)"
That district has been red for 40 years and Young always won in landslides.. The fact that this was a 2pt victory should be seen as a bit of an issue for Republicans.

"His approval ratings hovered [between 40-50%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorship_of_Chris_Christie#Public_opinion_summary) for most of his governorship prior to Sandy. Hes benefitted greatly from a partisan whitewashing in the media in an effort to groom him for a POTUS run, but his actual policy management was largely unpopular prior to his Sandy popularity bump."
Pennsylvania resident. Can confirm that hes relatively popular in both PA and NJ and would likely be able to carry both largely Democratic states in the presidential election since he was viewed positively as Governor.

Really? Thats not just a little bit hyperbolic? &gt; Consumers have always been kept in the dark about pink slime, meat glue, rBGH and GMOs in their food. And now, if the IDFA gets its way, youll be able to drink hormone-contaminated milk from an antibiotics-inundated cow fed genetically modified crops and producing milk containing hidden aspartame. And you wont have the right to know about any of this! Well first of all, its already illegal to sell milk from a cow receiving antibiotics. Organic brands tried to trick consumers by labeling their milk as anti-biotic free and were forced to stop since technically thats true of all milk sold (legally) in the United States. Plus I dont really need all this anti-science/anti-GMO FUD. And then it goes on to being all pro-raw milk. Are you shitting me? Raw milk is dangerous. Weve already invented plenty of new ways to die in the last 200 years, do we really need to bring back old ones? Oh, well. Why not? Lets all just go back to the 18th century before Pasteurization and and vaccines. All these life-saving advances in medical science are just not natural enough. But, yeah. Unlabeled aspartame in milk is stupid. First of all, people are allergic to that shit. Second of all, it tastes *nasty*. I dont need a bitter aftertaste added to my milk. If youre going to put terrible-tasting shit in my milk, then youd best let me know about it in advance so I can save my money.

"Misleading and overreacting. They only want to include sweeteners in flavored milk, without being required to call it low calorie on the front of the package. This is to make it more appealing to kids. The ingredients label would still require the sweeteners be listed. This is primarily to sell healthier chocolate milk that kids will drink as parents and schools are concerned about child obesity. If you are against the removal of the low calorie/reduced calorie/no added sugar labels on milk and/or cant be bothered to read the ingredients label then by all means let the FDA know that, just be sure you know what you are talking about first. edit: After seeing all the interest and skepticism for this comment, It is clear that some sources for this information is needed.

This ownership is, of course, a form of genetic enslavement that seeks to dominate and control all humans. How, exactly? Consider this: When you have a child, you are replicating your genetic code. Because your genetic code is 20% patented and owned by someone else, the act of having a child is, by definition, an act of genetic piracy that you are committing in violation of the law. These companies that own your genetic code can, if they wish, demand you pay royalties for every child you create. They can even demand that you pay them royalties for your own body replicating cells during processes like healing skin wounds or generating new red blood cells. Your body, in fact, replicates millions of cells each day, causing you to violate the U.S. governments laws on the theft of intellectual property. You are the criminal! "

I was raging until I saw that this is an article from Natural News..
"the dairy industry is not hiding anything, everything you need to know is on the table. this article, other than the use of aspartame, has a lot of mis-information. How about the pus content of its dairy products? How about its inhumane treatment of animals who are subjected to torture conditions and pumped full of genetically engineered hormones? How about the fact that homogenization and pasteurization turn a whole food into a dietary nightmare that promotes obesity, autoimmune disorders and cardiovascular disease 1. Raw milk, raw milk in general has some risks to it. the milk may contain bacteria or other ailments that may cause consumers who dont drink it often to get sick. in no way is raw milk healthier for you than pasturized milk, pasturized milk is for the safety of the consumers. the milk is heated to high temperatures for a short period of time to kill bacteria that could be harmful to us. its the same as washing an apple that may have fallen on the ground. too much of anything is a bad thing, if you are a healthy person keeping up a nutritional diet, milk will not make you obese, or give you cardiovascular disease. 2. the dairy industry does not pump their cows with any growth hormone or antibiotics to improve milk yields. if they do they need to state it on the label. it is actually illegal for milk to contain either. if cows have either in their system farmers move them to a hospital pen and are milked separately from the rest, and poured down the drain. it never comes into contact with the milk we drink today. before the milk even leaves the farm it is tested for any traces of hormones or antibiotics and if any is found then the milk is dumped on the spot and does not go into milk processing. 3. on the topic of pus in milk, dairy farmers hand milk the cows first to test if there is any unusual discharge from the udders before the actual milking begins. if there is any irregularities then the cow is moved to another pen and milked separately and that milk is poured down the drain. 4. the inhumane treatment of animals is not a true statement. dairy farmers, in fact, all animal agriculture farmers treat their animals with respect and dignity. these animals are their life and blood, and of course their financial stability. they are going to care for their animals in the up-most care, if not then the animals wouldnt produce the product consumers want these days, and the farmer would not have a lively hood. its like a musician tossing their instrument on the ground after every use, a mistreatment of the instrument is not going to produce a quality sound and therefore their work would not be the highest quality possible. websites and articles like these rarely have their facts straight and does nothing but to scare consumers and hurt the agriculture industry that feeds us everyday.

"Has nobody actually parsed the legalese and figured out what this is talking about? Its a bit of a PITA, but youd think a journalist would. In particular, it is not proposing *any* change to the definition of plain unmodified milk. Or skimmed milk or anything like that. [21 CFR 131.110(c)(2)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;r=PART&amp;n=21y2.0.1.1.21#21:2.0.1.1.21.2.1.1) is about *flavored* milk, like chocolate milk. Its already totally clear from the label that theres stuff in there that didnt come out of a mammary gland. If you have a characterizing flavoring ingredient (like chocolate), it may also include coloring, nutritive sweetener, emulsifiers, and stabilizers. Characterizing means in large print as part of the name. They want permission to make chocolate milk with non-nutritive sweetener without going into the details in the large print, i.e. in the primary name of the product. This has nothing to do with the ingredients list in small print. Because the current regulations dont permit low-calorie sweeteners as a possibly implied ingredient for flavored milk, they have to add additional wording to the large-print product name to explain the change. Their argument is that if they have to say Reduced calorie in large print, people will think it necessarily tastes worse. Maybe theyre right and this is scam to save cost because aspartame or sucralose are cheaper than corn syrup. You can argue about that. But it bears basically no relation to what the linked web site is raving about."
Weve already been over this crock of shit. The aspartame is still on the label. This is only about chocolate and strawberry milk. Natural News is a shitty site.

Can someone find a source for this that isnt from this cesspit of a website? Preferably something that isnt spinning this as a one sided affair.
It wasnt true last time this was posted. It it isnt true now. The additives would be labeled. What they are petitioning to do is to still be able to call it milk instead of variant like flavored milk or such.
"I went into this knowing absolutely nothing about the subject. But I saw the manner in which this article was written, and my immediate inclination was to not believe anything they said.

Thus the ingredient statement will still list the artificial sweetener (current labels will identify corn syrup if applicable). The group is simply misleading the public.

You might cook some of the nutrition out of milk in the pasteurization process but theres bigger fish to fry) only to discover they just shut down little Timmys liver. If you dont milk the damn cows yourself you *do not* know what conditions each batch is harvested in, and frankly while Im perpetuating a stereotype here, but the hippies that are into this stuff arent exactly the most dedicated to following rules and holding themselves to high standards. Source: Im a system administrator for a small chain dairy, and the food science guy who manages our QA will talk your damn head off about this stuff every chance he gets. Apparently it pays better than when he made beer. Go figs. "
"come on, man. natural news has all the credibility and scientific rigor of weekly world news, without the entertainment factor. At least wwn has batboy."
I stopped reading the article when it referenced INFOWARS LOL
Im allergic to aspartame. Awesome.
This article comes from a terrible source... 
Snopes. That is all
"Of course they will have to fucking label that it has aspartame in it, otherwise people with PKU who drink it will get very sick from drinking it. Naturalnews is one of the worst sources you could come up with, it is essentially a conspiracy theory website. The ads for colloidal silver in the right margin should raise some red flags."
"The article linked [this](http://tv.naturalnews.com/v.asp?v=C463AA940B9AEBA5D294F87FF0716579) video in the article. I have never seen something blatantly trying to manipulate people through use of buzz words and slanted, non-scientific, speech. The way he flaunts the 1st amendment at the end sounds like he knows he is talking out the ass."
"What the fuck, guys? Quit fucking upvoting Natural News! "
naturalnews.com? Seriously? Id trust Soap Opera Digest more on science news than that site.
naturalnews? Really? 
"I opened this article and in about 10 seconds realized that it was hugely biased and not trying to hide its sensationalism, so I figured it probably wasnt very accurate even though I knew nothing about the subject. After about 5 minutes of research, I realized that they truth was very benign. Then I went to read the top comments and felt proud of reddit for calling them out with well reasoned facts. It helped restore my faith in internet commentary. Then I switched to new and I lost my faith again. It was the equivalent of the crazy email forwards I would get late 90s before Snopes was a thing saying that the government was going to start charging for emails. "
"Please never post a link to Natural News here ever again. That website is manipulative, biased, full of errors, and just complete BS. Dont trust anything they say without verifying it at a reliable source first."
"Oh, so we are just pretending like Natural News is a legitimate source for anything? Next are we going to have front page posts about how the Illuminati are controlling our thoughts through secret ingredients in girl scout cookies? How about some modicum of critical thought."
If you want proof of the stupidity and gullibility of the average user of this subreddit - this story being upvoted is it.
Downvoting based purely on the source being called Natural News.
Natural News gets an automatic downvote from me. Not a trustworthy source 
This is a ridiculous rumor. [FDA regulations require that any product containing aspartame carry a warning label for phenylketonurics.](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.804)
"Natural News. Really? Are we going to upvote links from info-wars next? Natural News is a hive of scum and conspiracy with the ultimate goal of selling you some SCAM products. Negative or critical comments are censored on the site and articles are often uncited or are demonstrably false. http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/NaturalNews &gt;NaturalNews.com (formerly Newstarget) is a website founded by Mike the Health Ranger Adams. The site promotes almost every sort of medical woo known, though it specializes in vaccine denialism,[1] AIDS/HIV denial,[2] quack cancer medicine[3] and conspiracy theories about modern medicine.[4] Even other quacks think its a quack site.[5] The site has recently expanded its outlook to become an outlet for extreme environmentalism and conspiracy theorizing about Obama and gun control. If you cite NaturalNews on any matter whatsoever, you are almost certainly wrong."
Pretty nuts if this has any bearing on the truth... 
"Aspartame is the number one tested food product in the world and there has never been a connection made between it and negative health effects. So I honestly just dont care. EDIT: one of the most* (not necessarily the number one) tested. Also heres a link talking about the 200 scientific studies that have found aspartame safe and 100 different countries who agree. The FDA, JEFCA, and SCF all found aspartame to be safe to use. link: http://www.aspartame.org/"
Does this mean that there are currently ingredients that are unlabeled ?
"Does anyone besides me think that aspartame just tastes really bad? Besides the health issues and allergies some people have to it, I just cant get over the taste. Theres no way I would drink milk that had aspartame, I cant even stand to drink diet sodas"
Nothing should be hidden.
"Raw milk is not the safest, its the organic bunch going to extremes, but every ingredient should be labeled, and if raw milk is labeled as such, people should get the choice.The dairys selling it should be closely montored however.Nanny state interference in diet is going to far.aspartame is not a natural product at all, and should always be labeled.Unknown additives in milk are exactly the kind of thing that will drive parents towards unpasturised ,ie raw milk and its inherent health risks."
"EDIT: Wow, this title is so fucking misleading."
"Well, I already dont drink milk, so Im in the safe zone... But Im allergic to aspartame! In my previous days of milk drinking, something like this would have fucked me up real good."
This is targeted squarely at young school children who dont know the difference between sugar and poison. Edit; to fucking quote the rationale
"petitioners assert that consumers do not recognize milk -- including flavored milk -- as necessarily containing sugar. Accordingly, the petitioners state that milk flavored with non-nutritive sweeteners should be labeled as milk without further claims so that consumers can more easily identify its overall nutritional value. I get the impression that the milkman wants to add sweeteners to all kinds of milk to make it more appealing to kids. by using artificial sweeteners and simply calling it milk, rather than what it really is, they provide a healthy drink for kids. In my opinion, the milk ind is acting like the processed food industry, enhancing the flavor of their food to get the consumer addicted and using tricks like natural favors on the labelling. 60 mins did a piece similar to this where a company called givaudam tweaked flavors. anyway, artificial sweeteners do not help fight obesity or anything like that. "
Aspartame tastes gross.
This kind of stuff makes me sick!
"And Im sure theyll get it, good luck everybody "
Fuck aspertame. I will still be able to taste it.
"Okay, so they want to be able to just call it regular milk and not diet milk... Isnt there an entire food industry based on reduced calorie foods? I feel like listing something this as regular milk and not promoting the Diet aspect would hurt sales? Im no Business major but...common sense?"
"Try hard as you might, you cannot hide aspartame. I can taste that shit in anything. Tastes like crap."
There is no way this will pass. There are people who are deathly allergic to phenylalanine. Unless they want thousands of lawsuits theyll stay in their fucking place. EDIT: Its called [Phenylketonuria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria)
"Ive always been a daily milk drinker, skim milk even. Things like this make me reconsider that habit."
I really hope this is fake or not real. Im allergic to Aspartame and if its not labled I could ... wait... Lets let them do it. the day after Id be rich
"I love how the article starts out with, You probably already know that the FDA has declared war on raw milk and even helped fund and coordinate armed government raids against raw milk farmers and distributors. Nope actually I didnt know that. TIL. "
What about people with sensitivities to aspartame? It gives my husband panic attacks and my friends mom goes into seizures.
"Yea it triggers my migraine headaches, guess I wont be buying milk then"
The whole asparthame causing cancer thing is a myth. Some lady who claimed to have a doctorate degree randomly started the rumor online with no evidence at all and for some reason it caught on. 
"In small amounts, I dont think aspartame is that bad. When you consume it in huge quantities, it is probably quite bad, but it would be if you consumed lots of sugar too. Edit: http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/aspartame.asp"
"Why would anyone read anything associated with that webpage? The article has been shown by other commenters to be extremely misleading, so Ill focus on the source -- read the top stories on that webpage from the past week, month, and year. They consist of conspiracy theories about how the Colorado shootings were a false flag, how Angelina Jolie either faked her removal or how BRCA1 is a huge corporate conspiracy, and how all sorts of common stuff cures everything. Apparently, lemons, honey, and ozone therapy (wtf?) all cure cancer, heart disease, diabetes, skin conditions, and help you lose weight. On the other hand, [listed in the 10 most unhealthy, cancer-causing foods](http://www.naturalnews.com/039970_cancer_junk_food_carcinogens.html) are things like GMO foods (with the source for their danger being a link to an article on their own webpage), microwave popcorn, and artificial sweeteners. What a bunch of unbelievable bullshit-- as a science educator, reading this webpage and the comments are mentally exhausting. Its really depressing."
"Solution: stop drinking milk. Period. Humans are the only mammals that drink milk past infancy. And if thats not weird enough, were the only mammal that drink milk that comes from a different species."
Good thing I dont eat dairy products. 
"Itll never happen. Ever seen that label on diet soda that says Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine? If youre a Phenylketonuric, the phenylalanine in aspartame can FUCK YOU UP. Like make you retarded and shit. If this happened, it would be a ticking time bomb for a massive lawsuit."
Can we just get naturalnews banned from /r/politics already?
http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/05/aspartame_in_milk_why_the_dairy_industry_wants_to_sneak_artificial_sweeteners.html
"Maybe Im just not being thorough enough, but I cant find the answer to my question: **What about just plain ole white milk (whole fat, 2%, and 1% included)? Will they start adding completely pointless artificial sweeteners to these?**"
They lost me by using hyperbole. I know when someones trying to play me. 
Remember that this article is written by the same guy who still believes that childhood vaccinations cause Autism
"&gt;non-nutritive &amp;nbsp; &gt; youre working on that non-nutritive cereal varnish, arent you clark? &gt;Id like you to write something up for my presentation next week. Laymans terms, none of that inside jargon crap."
Artificial sweeteners cause these problems of obesity and diabetes by tricking the body into expecting sugar. Putting it in milk will only make the problem worse. 
Why would it be unlabeled? Why cant we make a chice what to put in our bodies?
"Im allergic to aspartame. I hope they dont start hiding it in things, its a big deal to me. Ive thrown out more food than anything when I forget to check the label carefully enough already. Usually yogurt and drink mixes, they already seem to hide it pretty well in the list. If I accidentally have aspartame, I know it... it feels like someone is stabbing me in the throat with a rusty coat hangar, and twisting it."
"I just want to say that Im drinking sugar free chocolate milk right now, and itd delicious. The milk really covers up the artificial flavor from the sweetener. If I was in charge of a school, I would see no reason to sell diabetes-milk over something that is delicious and healthy. People have issues with aspartame because theyre either allergic, or have an anti-science worldview. "
"wouldnt people, you know, notice anyway? "
"If milk isnt already one of the sweetest things you consume, there is a problem. Those promoting this secretive, unnecessary, artificial sweetening are scam artists and are full of shit. Any positive claims or pros lists attempting to purport this are completely contrived."
I started poking around the website to get a sense of how bad everyone is saying it is- [this](http://www.naturalnews.com/040400_gene_patents_genetic_slavery_human_DNA.html) pretty much summed it up.
"Please list the organizations name in the title! Simply calling them the US dairy industry is too broad. The article itself specifically names the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), the title should reflect that in some way. It makes no sense when people blame things on democrats, republicans, lobbyists, or (the one I hear most) the government. These are faceless organizations. Call each group; each person out by name. Tie them personally to what they are doing. This applies to so many situations other than this one. Please spread this practice. "
"Many comments on the article and a few in this thread are criticizing the government for this, which is somewhat unfair at this stage. While I dont personally think milk with additives should be able to be called milk and not something like flavored milk, the procedure the FDA is using in this case is a part of the normal regulatory process. A group in the industry submitted a proposed regulation, it had a certain number of signatures, and the FDA put it out for public comment. This is an example of the system working. The FDA is not trying to sneak anything past us, they are simply saying, hey, some people want this regulation. Should we do it? If they get a lot of negative feedback, in particular if food safety experts and consumers make it clear that this is not a desirable regulation, it is very unlikely that this regulation would come to fruition. I guess Im just trying to say everyone take a breath, and if this is an issue you care about submit your concerns to the FDA."
"That would be very bad, especially since my family and I are all allergic to aspertame, well have really bad reactions to it :/"
Is aspartame good? No. Is this sensationalized? Yes. Is Natural News a sensationalist biased source with incorrect facts? Yes. 
"The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ?the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional? (21CFR101.22)."
"well, theres a link included in the article to send comments to the FDA. https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/02/20/2013-03835/flavored-milk-petition-to-amend-the-standard-of-identity-for-milk-and-17-additional-dairy-products "
"I do not care, everything that is IN a product needs to be labeled for the consumer to be able to look for. Why doesnt milk just contain MILK?"
&gt; You probably already know that the FDA has declared war on raw milk and even helped fund and coordinate armed government raids against raw milk farmers and distributors. WTF?
You cant hide aspartame. As soon as that shit hits your tongue you realize what you have just been duped into drinking.
wow if this happens then fuck off seriously. Might as well just say fuck it and not even care to make anything healthy anymore i mean fuck.
The FDA is right up there with Monsanto. They are in bed with each other anyway. Time to start growing/producing our own food (until they make that illegal).

"Regulatory capture is bad, mmmkay."
"Natural news is a terrible source of information. Theyre like the left wing version of fox news, but somehow crazier."
Umm no.
"Nope. Just nope. Even though [aspartame isnt as dangerous as people thought](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17828671/), I would never argue to reduce the current level of labeling. "
As someone who has a strong negative reaction to aspertame....I disapprove
"On a rainy afternoon following a U.S. test, he quizzed Jerome Wiesner, the White House science adviser, about the contamination caused by nuclear explosions. How did the fallout return to earth from the atmosphere? ?It comes down in the rain,? Wiesner replied. The President stared out the window at the rain falling on his precious Rose Garden. ?You mean there might be radioactive contamination in that rain out there right now?? ?Possibly,? Wiesner said. After Wiesner left the office, Kennedy quietly sat in his chair for several minutes, looking at the rain falling on the garden. ?I never saw him more depressed,? recalled Ken O?Donnell. "
"1. Schools should not offer chocolate milk. If kids dont want regular milk, let them drink water. 2. Schools should not offer soda or fruit juice. Let the kids drink regular milk, which already contains a fair amount of carbs naturally or water. 3. Our society is addicted to carbohydrate rich foods. Dietary fatty acid intake is not the cause of the current diabetes and heart disease epidemics. Sugar, wheat and corn are."
They need to teach their kids better. My boys associate healthy with being good food not yucky food.
"Im Donny Rumsfeld, and I approve of this message"
You actually linked to that rag natural news? I sorry but nothing on their site is credible.
Artificial sweeteners dont taste good and if i cant avoid low calorie shit easily thats gonna be a hassle.
I dont give a f about anything else. I just want the label to say clearly whats in it so I can read it for me and my family. 
How about no milk becuse humans are the only mammal to drink it after weening 
Am I the only one around here who detests packaged flavored milks because they add thickeners to them? In school I always took the plain milk for this reason. My kids are wild-eyed crazy sugar hounds and Im sure theyd never refuse flavored milk. It is what it is.
"please dear god no, i cant STAND aspertame. I cant have anything with that in there. "
"This is an effing joke, first of all this article is lying to you, it is illegal to give cows hormones and milk them for human consumption. 2nd it is even more illegal to milk cows for human consumption that have been treated with antibiotics within 7 days. this is more propaganda by Organic Enthusiasts to get people to stop drinking/eating conventional non organic dairy products. Ive worked on several dairy farms and have never and will never allow antibiotics into milk nor hormones to be processed for human consumption. I drink milk too people! Also if your milk wasnt pasteurized it would cost 20-50 dollars a gallon and would expire in a matter of hours."
Not labeling aspartame content can be **lethal** to phenyloketuronics.
America. The only developed country in the world were the kids are so fucking fat by 3rd grade companies struggle on how to market to kids. 
Why should any food product ever get such an exemption? No good can come of it.
"Considering the source I know its probably bunk, but food labeling is a problem. No one is held to a specific terminology and a lot of companies dance around naming their ingredients. Its not cool watching my roommate almost go into anaphylactic shock in the kitchen because the ingredient listed was some new name for aspartame."
"The problem is many things, but one important factor are Phenylketonurics. Because Aspartame is made from the Amino Acid Phenylalanine, Phenylketonurics are not able to digest it, causing adverse health effects such as brain damage."
How do I hide all posts from Natural News?
nothing will be done by anyone.
Wait... in the US corporations arent required to properly label their food?
thank goodness i stopped drinking milk a few years back. no suger either that stuff is poison. natural honey is the way to go 
"Kids love milk. Milk costs more than pop. Kids love pop. Parents dont have a lot of money. Consequence: Pop is more readily available. I dont know about you, but I grew up loving milk. We never had enough and always needed more. Our income was always below national poverty levels and milk never became cheaper, even with the taxes not applied to it (as a staple product in canada). I hope that one day milk is cheaper than cola. I could live off just milk and day old pizza...mmmmmm"
This article has inspired me to never drink milk ever again!...said no one ever.
only reason you would want this not on the label is if you intend to abuse it. dont get companies that operate this way. makes me wonder what else is unlabeled.
That would be horrible. Fianc? is allergic to aspartame.
Some people are allergic to aspartame. So now you cant drink milk if youre allergic to aspartame. Oh wait theyll come out with some new form of milk that doesnt have aspartame and charge more for it.
"If the applicants are so certain there is nothing wrong with aspartame, let them put it on the label. If they dont like the publics reaction to seeing the word aspartame on the ingredients list, thats a marketing challenge, not a regulatory one. "
"While I dont buy into the anti-aspartame hysteria, I definitely dont like hidden, unlabeled additives in my food."
Aspartame tastes like shit. You start putting that shit in milk and Ill stop drinking it.
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame#Phenylalanine_and_phenylketonuria Milk already contains some phenylalanine, adding more could make for a quite hazardous food if you have the genetic mutation that causes PKU. This is not only dumb...its downright reckless endangerment."
Syrian refugees hate aspartame in their milk.
Tip all the cows!
ITT: Woefully delusional victims with something resembling Stockholm syndrome tell you how much they love being poisoned and getting fucked
Aspartame is some NASTY tasting stuff. I cant eat or drink anything with it as an ingredient because it just linkers in my mouth. Its worse than being locked in the car with a fart.
Aspartame is just as bad as sugar for the kids teeth and it stimulate them more than sugar. Nothing some added fluoride and Ritalin cant fix though. 
"For those of you who havent heard it, you may be disgusted by the way Aspartame was initially approved by the FDA in the first place. It involved none other than former Secretary of Defense, [Donald Rumsfeld](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robbie-gennet/donald-rumsfeld-and-the-s_b_805581.html). "
"Natural News is a HUGE PILE OF HIPPIE CONSPIRACY GOBSHITE. BAD R/POLITICS Seriously, fuck this shit."
The last thing we need is a cover-up for Aspartame! Its bad enough food companies can legally put Natural Flavorings on the ingredients and not have to tell what synthetic garbage that really consists of. Natural my a$$.
Aspartame is not good for health and youd have to be fucking retarded to knowingly consume it.
STOP UPVOTING NATURALNEWS YOU IDIOTS
First off if you are defending this bill because you think kids are getting fat off milk you are retarded. They get fat off the shit food they eat at home. Anyway they should be required to list their ingredients just like everyone else. 
Cant we just leave milk as milk? The fuck.
"I dont know whats funnier, the braindead idiots who think aspartame is something they should put in their body Or the thread with all the idiots who thought GMOs were something they should put in their body If you dont care about getting fucked, why should I care for you? Bon apetit"
"Well cow milk already has pus and shit in it, so why not add this. Yeah, drinking another species breast milk ... is not a bit weird at all. "
Ive noticed an opposite happening in the UK. Our products quite proudly say No artificial sweetenerson the package... whats wrong with a little sugar in moderation anyway?
thank god aspartame is so healthy! ...
"Yum. I always like a little military-grade neurotoxin in my foodstuffs. Gives it that extra zi- (ow, why does my head hurt?... whaddyamean ive got a fuckin tumor?!)..."
"Finally, IDFA and NMPF argue that the proposed amendments to the milk standard of identity would promote **honesty and fair dealing** See...its all about honesty. "
Naturalnews? really?
WHAT? OH MY LAWD!!! THAT IS BLASPHEMOUS!!
Yet another chemical in our food that we know is bad for our bodies long term. This is absolute bullshit 
"Im really tired of all the bullshit around aspartame, find me one...one peer-reviewed published link that concludes it causes cancer. Anyone."
Coming soon: milk by the gallon without extra bullshit for DOUBLE the price!
"Why is the first comment here not that we shouldnt be reading a website that doesnt believe in germs, vaccines or science?"

Drink almond milk.
"1) I thought aspartame causes severe allergic reactions. Thats why the can says warning, this contains phenelketelneurics or something like that. 2) Aspartame is also a laxative. The kids who decides to only drink chocolate milk might be in for a surprise. "
"IF this is true...then it has to be stopped. I dont know everything there is to know about aspartame, only what ive read and heard from both reliable and unreliable sources, but im sure there is still people looking in to whether its very dangerous. Anyway, regardless of how dangerous it is, it is not a natural part of milk, therefore should never be hidden from added ingredients. EVER. I hope you people in the U.S put a stop to this asap."
"I really like dairy. I am buying fresh milk (and also butter and cheese) from a local farmer. Yay me. FDA can lick my fresh-milk-infested intestines, sorry, I meant testicles."
"Give me a shitbrick of sugar each day over a packet of aspartame. Im not even sure what a shitbrick is, but its gotta be better than that other shit."
But but .... we need federal bureaucracies with the power to legislate without the nasty checks and balances of congress. After all we have to act fast to ensure no nasty chemicals are put in foods.
Counter-petition
"Its funny how up in arms so many people are getting about this without realizing that aspartame has already been an ingredient in these flavored milks for years. This has nothing to do with whether or not it can be an ingredient, or whether or not its labeled as an ingredient. But so many people are just reading the title then getting outraged. It would be like if someone posted an article saying the government was thinking of allowing how fructose corn syrup as an ingredient in food. If youre that opposed to aspartame, then just dont drink low calorie chocolate milk. Simple as that."
What the fucking fuck?????????????????????????????????
Fucking Gross.
Because milk isnt already sweet enough? Seriously? do we need to sweeten it more?
Informed decisions cannot be made if information is hidden. And WHY does the dairy industry NEED to hide it?
Why? Its already a part a me. 
aspartame is bad gear
ABSOLUTELY NOT!! Many of us have medical conditions that prevent it!!!
"My issue with it is, if Im buying something like milk, I dont expect it to be artificially sweetened. Aspartame makes me sick. If I buy something that says low calories, or no calories, I check the label. If they are going to take away the low fat, low calorie, etc., labels, they need to post artificial sweeteners on the front. It seems dishonest and risky to me to just change ingredients on long-standing food items and not notify people."
This is bullshit. I drink chocolate milk all the time after workouts and I dont want to drink fucking aspartame and then get brain cancer in 10 years. Absolute bullshit.
"THIS would explain why all of a sudden last year I can no longer drink milk without developing ridiculous diarrhea within 20 minutes! For some reason my gut freaks the fuck out with artificial sweeteners. I used to eat the same foods as my diabetic roommate, but now, any artificial sweetener twists my gut into knots. **Fuck all of this** and everybody!"
Too bad for all those folks with PKU; yet another food they have to avoid.
dairy is fucking gross to begin with. the thought of drinking a glass of milk makes me want to wretch. 
"This makes me so angry. Sucralose causes me to have severe gall bladder attacks. Ive called the FDA too. Edit- Where will we draw the line then, if this is approved? I say lie to your kids, tell them they have diabetes. "
Unpasteurised milk is illegal in the US?! What the actual fuck?
Why do our food suppliers keep wanting to poison us?
"The article its a little preachy, imo. Yes, I agree that everything about our food should be transparent, but that was about as subtle a bites as fox news."
The fact that reddit keeps upvoting submissions from naturalnews (among other total BS sources) is absolutely astounding.
&gt;The dairy industry is to food as Lance Armstrong is to sports. Favorite line in this article 
They used to flavor things with sugar. 
"People drink less milk because it tastes bad because it is watered down and teaming with hormones. Parents and kids know more than occasional drinking of milk is no longer safe for you, nor healthy. It causes acne and hormonal imbalances. It also tastes much worse than it used to. Maybe they are adding sweeteners to hide some deficiency in taste they have caused, probably through some milk production actions we would be horrified to know about."
"Downvoted for citing naturalnews.com, an extremely unreliable site full of misinformation, conspiracy-mongering and promotion of all means of medical quackery as if it were a legitimate news source. "
My primary problem is increased search cost. I avoid artificial sweeteners and seeing reduced calories saves me time when shopping. 
" This is very important, I agree, but, any link to Natural News automatically has less credibility with me. I used to like Mike Adams, but lately hes just gone off the rails."
"I go to great pains to avoid any artificial sweeteners. Why? Because given my family history I have a 60% chance of developing cancer. Thats not environment but straight genetics. So while I may not control the air I breathe or the water I bathe in I do have 100% say in what I eat. The idea that stuff I am trying to avoid can be added and *not labeled* really makes it impossible for me to eat anything I dont grow or ranch myself. Seriously, why cant we label our food accurately and completely? "
"Well by supply and demand if people dont want to buy this because of the carcinogens they wont, and therefore the companies will stop selling it."
What about those like myself who are allergic to aspartame? Does this me I will have to avoid dairy all together? 
Aspertame is bad for you. Plain sugar is actually preferable. Monsanto is a company that can bend our government to its will. Down with Monsanto!
sure why not?
But I always drink plenty of....malk?
"Im glad to see the top comment be a link to Snopes. Natural News is a tinfoil hatter site that when they arent crying about Liberty^TM Raw Milk, theyre posting anti-vaccination stories. "

"By most estimates, the United States has lost more than 600K jobs since NAFTA was enacted. And those estimates are fairly conservative. So, think about it, these are jobs lost only to Mexico. Given the lawlessness and violence in many of the border regions, the cost advantage, including increased security and bribes to local officials, must be great enough to justify the move. Now look at TPP, which includes several other countries with better local security and even lower costs I think its safe to say we can see outsourcing accelerate. http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/more-nafta-nonsense/"
"There is enough information, and has been for quite sometime, about the asymmetrical merits of the TPP. What I find most disconcerting as a moral and compassionate human being, are the millions of underserved people in developing countries that rely on medicine cop offs. To me, the idea of making a cure proprietary information goes against the Hippocratic oath. Yes, I understand the amount of R and D that goes into developing a medication. Trust me. There are limits though. Drug companies are bringing in record profits. If it were me, Id turn in the extra Mercedes to treat a few hundred thousand sick people. Thats just me. Edit: Hippocratic, not hypocritical. Fucking auto correct. "

"No matter if you believe the TPP is good or bad, an agreement between countries negotiated in secret is insane to begin with. If it was so good, it would be completely open, being hidden just goes to show those negotiating know for a fact the people would reject and protest it."
" TPP treaty set to destroy jobs and kill millions, both Chomsky &amp; Buchanan oppose it http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3_HglNV_CpI/UtWWj_bFbjI/AAAAAAAAAvA/UYc99SfC1Uw/s1600/TPP+wages.jpg TPP is set to destroy American jobs, impoverish America and kill millions in developing countries. When people as diverse as Noam Chomsky and Pat Buchanan are virulently against it, but the bipartisan crooks in DC are pushing to Fast Track it through by keeping the contents a secret and having no debate - you know its a treaty that is not in the interests of Americans. Ross Perot was exactly correct when he famously told America in the 1992 presidential debate ?there is going to be a giant sucking sound of US jobs heading south?. Ross Perot was talking about NAFTA. TPP has been described as NAFTA on steroids. TPP sets up a system where Corporations can sue local taxpayers if a government brings in any law or regulation that hurts Corporate profits (or existing laws do). So that is any law or regulation that protects the rights or the living standards of the people over profiteering by Corporations. So pretty much anything. The settlements are expected to run into the billions. The treaty will make it very difficult for any country to effectively regulate or otherwise control international banks. It allows the major pharmaceutical companies to extend their profiteering - it is set to kill millions by denying access to affordable drugs. http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/take-action/tpp/ Copyright Law and Environmental protections become the lowest common denominator in order to boost the profits of Protectionist companies and Polluters. Monsanto will be using the new treaty in order to prevent countries from limiting the spread of its GMO seeds. There are 600 Corporate lobbyists helping to draw up the treaty, including those of Monsanto and Halliburton. Representatives of the people? Zero, zip, nada, none.

"A sizeable number of people wanted Medicare for all, or at least a public option. Their will was wholly disregarded out of hand before debate even began."
"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/the-frauds-on-the-hill-target-obama-97537.html Congress passed Obamacare, the president signed it, the Supreme Court upheld it, Obama campaigned on it a second time and was reelected. So in what manner was the will of the people disregarded? "
The public option was the will of the people. The ACA was the will of the Democrats and the private insurance companies.
"I really enjoyed reading that poll that came out last week that said 46% of Americans are against Obamacare but the second question in that poll was are you opposed to the Affordable Care Act, and 36% said they were opposed to it. What the congressional GOP is doing is misinforming people about the law, and polls like that are proof of it. Obamacare was a republican idea in the early 90s. Im pretty sure they oppose it because of their undying spite of seeing Obama in the whitehouse and has very little to do with the legislation. They are proving that they are willing to drive the country off a cliff in order to oppose and undermine the president. Sounds pretty childish and that the GOP are just a bunch of sore losers. I hope Obama calls their bluff and Im pretty sure he will"
Because its a manifestation of business interests -- illustrating perfectly the corporatism in the United States. The idea that its being touted as some paradigm of democratic legislative action is absurd. 
"True, but if people hold out for legislation that will completely and finally fix an ENORMOUS problem in one fell swoop, youre going to be waiting a *long* time. Especially if that solution involves fundamentally changing the way things operate from the very top to the very bottom in this country. The ACA may not be perfect, but it does do a lot of good things that people agree with. And apart from the things that are actually in the law itself, it does three more things that are of the utmost importance: 1) it affirms that healthcare is a right, not a privilege. 2) it sets in the minds of Americans that 100% healthcare coverage is the ultimate goal. 3) it gets Americans used to the idea of having the government involved in healthcare in any capacity, however limited. Those are no small feats, considering the status quo, so you shouldnt trivialize it because it isnt perfect. What this does is incrementally fix the problem while changing the mindset of Americans so as to open the door for more permanent and better solutions in the future. "
Some of us really wanted universal healthcare.
The will of the wrong people.....
Do you not recall the 2010 elections and the events surrounding the passage of the bill?
"So i take it you believe in the fallacy that the will of the people can be vicariously implemented through elected officials? BTW, todays Obamacare (i.e. the ACA) is not the same Obamacare (which was a universal healthcare system) that liberals wanted. You basically have a health insurance mandate (much like a car insurance mandate), and can be penalized financially via taxes if you dont have it. There are people out there that actually believe that health insurance will be provided to them now. The Supreme Court once again overstepped their judicial boundaries by upholding in under the Tax Clause. If you believe in their argumentation, you will love their BS in Wickard v. Filburn. Here is the bad thing about democracy (majority opinion): it is not always right, it is just what most people want (and in some cases, it is not even most in the strictest sense of the word). "
Since when have the actions of congress been a benchmark for the will of the people?
"Does this mean we all wanted Monsanto protections, Indefinate detention, the FISA court, and on, and on, and on... Or does it mean something else? Something like, the government doesnt act according to the will of the people?"
"Man, someone needs to figure out a way to tap the reddit circlejerk as an energy source. "
"Those things werent done by Real Americans^TM so they dont count. Its the will of the Real Americans^TM that is being disregarded which is why they have to Take Back Their Country^TM from the Radical Socialist Islamofascist Atheist Communist Theocrats^TM. Edit: As a couple of commenters have pointed out, I seem to have gotten one of the trademarks wrong. Seems its actually the Radical Atheist Communist Islamofascist Socialist Theocrats^Tm What can I say, I was late for an appointment. My bad."
"&gt; in what manner was the will of the people disregarded? Uh... everywhere else? And the people didnt want this Obamacare horseshit, they wanted universal healthcare. But then the big insurance companies would become obsolete, so it didnt happen, nor will it."
"Bill OReilly made a good point this morning. Just let the bill go through. If it fails, the Obama camp is fucked. If Obamacare works, the country is better off."
"Kind of a silly question, seeing as how the will of the people has been disregarded for decades now."
Replaced Obamacare with PATRIOT act. Would you still make the same argument?
"If they had the will of the people on their side, theyd be able to pass a clean bill defunding Obamacare. They wouldnt have to attach it to the budget and threaten a government shutdown. If they had the will of the people then the Republican house would pass a bill, which would be approved by the Republican Senate, and then President Romney would sign it into law. Thats not how it is. They need to get with reality. "
"First, I want to say that the ACA wasnt what I wanted. It didnt go far enough, but in my eyes its better than nothing. Here are my problems with the left-wing talking points regarding the fight over the ACA: 1. The way it was passed was not ideal. Straight down party lines, on a budget vote. How can Republicans be criticized for trying to defund it in a similar way that the ACA was passed in the first place? 2. Polls show pretty consistently that its not a popular law. You can argue that the public is just not educated on the subject, and there is a lot of misinformation about the ACA, but the poll numbers are consistent. 3. I voted for Obama twice, but I wasnt really voting FOR Obama, but AGAINST the opposition. Although, I did want to give Obama a chance the first time, I voted for him the second time because the thought of President Romney is still deeply horrifying to me. I didnt vote for Obama because of the ACA and there is simply no reason to believe that Obama was re-elected purely because of the ACA. Are Republicans being ridiculous? Of course. The sky is not falling, the ACA isnt going to crash the economy. And in fact, the Republican Party is a bigger danger to the economy than the ACA could ever be. Still, Im looking forward to seeing what the health care exchanges have to offer tomorrow, but I really wanted either the public option, or universal coverage. "
"Well personally I dont like the law because it keeps all the health care profit barons in business. So we might see a 20% drop in premiums but what we should keep in mind is that we as a nation are still paying 5 times more for health care than other developed nations with universal health care and by most measures are getting inferior health care. That 20% drop doesnt sound so good anymore now does it? How did we get this abomination of a health care law? The answer of course comes down to the influence of money in our politics. Neither dems or reps were willing to lose out on the huge stacks of cash they get from groups like the AMA, health care giants, or especially the health insurance lobby. But hey, I guess its kind of a step in the right direction, but just barely. Edit: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems Here you can see US down at number 37 right around such beacons of prosperity as Slovenia, Dominica, and Cuba. Conveniently they have a per capita expenditure ranking as well and as you can see we are number 1! Go USA! Oh...wait...that just means we have the least efficient health care system in the world. But seriously, a few % off our premiums is nowhere near enough to change this picture in any significant way. We need universal health care."
"We werent. And it pisses me off to hear Obamacare doesnt work, when that shit hasnt started yet and doesnt until Jan 1, 2014. "
"To play devils advocate, Just because someone is elected doesnt necessarily mean you agree with everything they do. I dont recall voting on ACA/Obamacare directly. Congress passed the patriot act &amp; NSA powers, the president signed it, the FISA upheld it, After evidence showing he supports these programs Obama was reelected. So in what manner was the will of the people disregarded? It goes both ways. Because of all of those things does that mean that the NSA spying is the will of the people? Not necessarily and in that case it seems to be the exact opposite. "
"Smart Americans want single payer. Folks who believe in unbridled capitalism dont understand that a) fewer tax dollars are spent on health care in countries with socialized medicine, b) because government sets rates medical companies cant get away with a 4000% markup on saline and c) its in their own economic interest. Republicans are taking money from insurance lobbyists hand over fist for fighting Obamacare. GOP and Tea Party voters dont have the education necessary to vote intelligently. Edited as capitalist is offensive to those with an extra 21st chromosome. "
Everyone knew this would be a fight from the minute it was proposed until long after it was funded. Just prepare for the battles to come. They will do anything to prevent the success of this law because they know that its the nail in the GOP coffin. Also. Ill bet a nickel that Cruz is the 2016 nominee. edit - :s/bill/law/g
" The ACA was favored by the people when it was passed. Since then the right wingers have been pounding on it relentlessly. Fox, the right wingers running ads against it and endless hours of harping on TV , has has made the needle move. Isnt it time to quit crying and see how it works out? It is the law and it is here. "
You mean how the will of the people is completely represented with regards to drug prohibition and most people want marijuana possession and use criminalized? 
Regarding drug laws...no one ever asked us. This is one of those rare issues in which there is bipartisan support - but in direct opposition to what a majority of Americans want. Weve never even come close to a bill rewriting our drug policies on a federal level. 
"The trouble with the right in this country is that they solely believe in outcomes and have no respect for the process itself, which is actually far more important."
"The sad thing about this bill is that it does not accomplish what most Americans think it does. It is not universal healthcare, but universal insurance. It does nothing for the actual cost of healthcare which is the primary issue in this country. Instead, it forces insurance premiums on anyone that isnt covered in one way or another. Even with subsidies, people that couldnt afford insurance previously will have to scrape by. The real issue is that even though they have insurance, there is still a high deductible that needs to be met to see any real benefit (for covered items). So unless a person has a catastrophic illness/accident, they will only have to pay ~$10,000 instead of ~$100,000+ For someone at the poverty line, that is still too much money to pay. EDIT - Thats just a tiny piece. There are 2000+ more pages of other stipulations and what-not."
"?When government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny?. Thomas Jefferson"
The effects of the gerrymandered House of Representatives districts were disregarded. I think they want us to put gerrymandering on the list of things to fix.
Republicans use the term The American People and the will of the people exclusively for people who agree with them.
Teabaggers think that the small gaggle of assholes who agree with them are somehow *ALL* Americans. Dangerously delusional useful idiots.
Its not the will of all the people its the will of the GOP that was disregarded. They know what we want better than we do. Which is absolutely nothing different and no better ideas.
Our nation is polarized. Another reason why the next American revolution will just be breaking up the political duopoly. 
It wasnt. Republicans simply dont want healthcare to be a democratic achievement. They were stupid enough to brand it Obamacare and now its going to bite them in the ass.
"The fact people think this is the solution to a broken system shows the profound ignorance. They started taking money out of my check LAST February, I am already down a thousand dollars and still pay for my own health care. Looking at the plans in my state, I couldnt save money by using obamacare, so whether I use it or not I lose $75 a month. Nothing in life is free, the middle class has paid for nearly everything and this is just another straw heaped on our backs. How the fuck does obamacare solve $6 Tylenol pills and the ridiculous pricing that cause the issue in the first place? "
"If this shit is good enough for the people, then the Congress, unions and everyone else needs to be in it. "
"It *has* been disregarded. Just because there is an asterik that has to be attached doesnt mean it is blatantly false, its just a lie by omission. Lets not forget that if the house of representatives was elected via a popular vote nationwide (same as the senate) that the democrats would have held a majority in both. It is only due to gerrymandering that the republicans were able to hold onto the house. [Politifact did a piece on it.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/) The fact remains that they are using the maintained majority in the house of representatives to say most people agree with us since representatives are elected more often. It is cherry-picking evidence at its worst because not only are they selecting one location of data (the majority in the house of representatives), they have through gerrymandering been able to skew the actual intent of the people. There are ways that a slight difference could be made between the popular vote and the actual end result that isnt attributed to gerrymandering, such as high population states having more turnout for one party than the other, and thus winners of the democrats would get a boost in total popular vote without any additional seats. However, it is rare that this happens and even worse - there is a significant majority in the house rather than the very close that would be suggested if a single candidate just had good turnout. What sickens me is that the *majority* of the issues that are currently being had would be completely, absolutely and totally invalidated by having a proper representation of the peoples will in the house. We can argue all day about whether or not that would be best for this country - but we would not have the house trying to have a standoff with the president over every little thing if the republicans hadnt gerrymandered it. So, while even the devil can quote scripture and the republicans saying that the will of the people has been disregarded is actually *true*, it is that the will of the people was to reelect and give a majority back to the democrats in the house and that they instead thwarted that will of the people and ended up getting themselves a majority and now were seeing the results. *Note:* I understand and believe that either party would willfully engage in the process of gerrymandering. I do not think this is a republican only issue. However the republicans are the ones currently benefitting the most from it. We need to change to a slightly different model in order to avoid these sorts of issues. It is degrading the ability of congress to actually implement the will of the people and is allowing money and greed to trump democracy. TL;DR: They are correct - the will of the people has been disregarded. But not about Obamacare (the ACA) or the debt ceiling or anything like that. The house should have a plurality of democrats in it if popular vote is any indication, and at minimum the majority should be very, very slim."
"Eh, I dont necessarily see it as disregarding the will of the people, since they are elected officials and are technically playing within the framework of the system. That said, I would say that the system needs to change to stop these loophole abuses."
"Because the elite membership of the Republican Party believes its political platform and policy constitutes the will of the people. Well, at least the people that *matter.* Which is them."
"[Over half the population disapproves of the Affordable Care Act; under 40% approve of it.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html) Seems somewhat relevant when were talking about the will of the people, anyway."
This exact situation happened with Scott Walker. He carried through on his campaign promises and then people got upset and managed to get a recall election even though he did what he said he was going to do.
"People on here forget what happened in 2010. The democratic house and senate passed it, then the people voted them out and put in people to repeal it. If anyone is paying attention to congress, tell me why Harry Reid is being a giant douche nozzle. This guy wont bring up any bills the house passed."
Letting the Republicans touch it. Edit: an S.
Congress no longer has a vested interest in the people. Its kind of hilarious but the US is going the way of those ridiculous Hollywood dystopian novels.
Why do you ask questions you know the answer to?
"Didnt democrats take a shellacking (in the Presidents own words) in 2010 over the law? Also, in 2012 republicans maintained their majority in the house. Maybe the will of the people is preferring gridlock."
"Just to provide a counterpoint on the support via re-election: Mathematically, 51% of people could be against Obamacare, but 49% vote Obama, 48% vote Republican, and 3% vote other. Thats not how it happened, but implying the majority support Obamacare because Obama was re-elected is a false supposition."
the will of corporate interests and tea partiers were disregarded. So it doesnt count! clearly.
apparently GOP leadership doesnt understand that living in a democracy inherently means you dont always get what you want. Why do these clowns keep getting elected again?
"gun control was a mandate from the people. IGNORED. not shutting down the government. mandate from the people. IGNORED. congress doesnt give a rats ass what the people want or whats best for the country. and they cant be held accountable until there is campaign and lobbying reform, and a fix for gerrymandering. The deck is stacked for the rich and big business, and they are more contemptuous of the average american citizen than ever before. "
"90% of people polled are in favor of background checks for buying a gun. Those arent Real Americans, so the Republicans can ignore them. 30% of people polled want to abolish Obamacare. Those are Real Americans, so their opinion carries more weight than the majority. "
the 1%
Why would any law maker in their right mind be against universal health care? How does that makes sense?
"Living in one of the big bad socialist countries (Denmark) it dumbfounds me how anyone can be against this. Great countries -need- healthy and well educated people, and the things we all use at some point in life (daycare, schools, healthcare, nursing homes etc) we might as well all chip in on via taxes."
My guess is that the Republicans hate the idea that Obama will go down in history as THE president that created the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare is a nasty word for them.
The will of the people* *rich lobby groups 
"If you live in the conservative Fox News bubble, you will think that everyone is a psychotic Randian theocrat, as ironic as that is. Mittens actually thought he was going to win the election, by a landslide. "
"Show me a poll in which people support Obamacare. The point being, Obamacare didnt win his second term because of it, he won his second term despite it. Also, remember the bloody post-Obamacare House elections? These republicans were put into office to fight Obamacare, and thats what theyre doing. "
"It was passed in a backdoor fashion, the Supreme Court upheld the mandate as a tax rather than the way it was argued and the President was reelected on more than one factor, not just the ACA. Its not a cut and dry as you think. "
"I dont like it. See, will of the people."
I wonder if the republicans will want the name Obamacare removed once it is successful.
"It goes both ways. We all want reform, we all want the same thing. I dont believe one side is more at fault than the other. Its a no-win situation. "
"I think its the fact that union groups like the teamsters are against it and now other unions and the senators are getting exceptions to the act really concerns me and others. If the middle class has to front the bill for everyones health care the economy will be irreparably damaged. The fact is it isnt structured like the working ones (ex) Canada , Great Britain. Im all for universal health care but everyone has to participate in the ultimate funding or it wont work. The working programs in other countries are highly regulated hopefully the administration fixes the rampant amount of fraud going on with these programs and gets the money and care to the people who need it. Only time will tell, but you have to let it happen first."
Fallacy. You assume that his being reelected is an indication of support for this issue. Obama supports many different issues. 
"One MAJOR point this country was founded on was the government NEVER being able to force you to buy anything. And thats exactly what this is. If people want to be ignorant and not have health care, then thats their right, who the hell is anyone to say different and force them to buy something?"
"will of the people... aka mob rule. 51% of the population should never force the other 49% of people into ANYTHING. regardless of how beneficial and benevolent the means or ends are, its still force. "
"Segregation was also upheld by the Supreme Court. Should that have been accepted even today? Before Butthurt, I voted for Obama and I am disappointed by what he has done, failed to do and see him as a Plinko President. He drops the coins down and hopes they fall into the right place."
in this title it doesnt mention anything in relation to the peoples will other than they didnt want a scumbag like Romney in office. Just because someone gets elected does NOT mean the will of the people is 100% behind them.
Do you think 50% +1 = the will of the people?
"Its only the will of fraudulent voters, who by definition are people who Republicans would rather not allow to vote."
People are dumb and think it should be free. They are too stupid to realize that Canadians actually pay a shit ton for it in taxes. So if you tell em they will be taxed for it. They lose their shit because its free everywhere else. Sure. 
"Because its socialism and wealth redistribution. More taxes and penalties on the middle class, therefore making the rich richer and the poor poorer."
"I think it was because it was 1000+ pages and almost nobody knew what was in it, and when you did read it, there were a lot of earmarks in there for things unrelated to healthcare. Some politicians took advantage of this and any arguments against it were you just dont care about people.. It was politics as usual and turned a lot of people off. "
The people also reelected a GOP majority in the House and the GOP reps ran against Obamacare. 
"To answer the OP, the Supreme Court doesnt really represent the will of the people."
Id love to know the percentage of voters that are even aware of either candidates politics. 
"I don?t think the politicians understand how much harm they are doing to our country we are the most powerful nation in the world and yet we look like bickering children who can?t keep their affairs in order. I never agreed with the GOP agenda but until recently I never believed they would allow their ideology to really hurt the country it?s sad and disheartening. This is a Republican boondoggle, the GOP are to blame and no one else. Americans need and want their government to run smoothly, the congress needs to learn to compromise and do their job effectively. To me random government shutdowns means someone in Washington is not doing their job and needs to be replaced."
Its the largest legislation ever passed with no support from the opposing party whatsoever. And now the opposing party is doing all it can to de-fund the legislation. Are you surprised? Have you never heard of democracy?
"This is just my opinion. I find that any politician making a claim about the ACA, and then turning around and say that they need more time to read and study it is clearly incompetent. Ive seen and been part of personal arguments that mirror back the bullshit excuse of TL;DR. As of now, theyve had over 3 years to read and understand the damn thing, so making the ACA this hidden and evil mystery is so laughable that I can only continue to shake my head at that kind of whining from any political party. So far, Ive only heard of attempts to delay it, repeal it, or change it to limit birth control even more. And the only excuses Ive heard is that its evil, immoral, and TL;DR. W. T. F. Can anyone tell me whats so evil about it that will harm more than help with text and accurate references from the actual bill to back it up? I hope that theres responses beyond personal religious sensibilities that are not forced on anyone and tl;dr, because those ideas need to be applied to improve the already signed into law bill."
He didnt say *Which* peoples will.
Replace Obama and Obamacare with Bush and The Patriot act and take another shot at telling me this is a valid argument to make. 
"I really have no idea how Obamacare will affect me, can anyone give me a good place to go so I can get educated? Ive Googled but Im not sure which one would be best. Thanks in advance."
"No, but see, its taxation without representation, because we dont get to vote for the elected individuals who passed the ACA into law, and instead those decisions are all made for us in the House of Lords over in England. "
It doesnt go far enough. Just extend Medicare as an option for all Americans. It would be cheaper and we know it works. The ACA just seems to create a large windfall for health insurance corporations. 
"Why stop at ACA, here are some other promises that he campaigned on: * We reject the use of national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. And: We support constitutional protections and judicial oversight on any surveillance program involving Americans. * We will close the detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years. * We will revisit the Patriot Act and overturn unconstitutional executive decisions issued during the past eight years. * We will not use signing statements to nullify or undermine duly enacted law. * Often the best source about waste, fraud and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism . . . should be encouraged rather than stifled. * Eliminating special tax breaks for oil and gas companies: including repealing special expensing rules, foreign tax credit benefits, and manufacturing deductions for oil and gas firms. * Congress has set rules regarding the tax deductibility of the salaries of CEOs, but forms of non-salary compensation have become popular. Obama would look at revamping definitions of compensation. * Will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year. This will eliminate taxes for 7 million seniors -- saving them an average of $1,400 a year-- and will also mean that 27 million seniors will not need to file an income tax return at all. * Will address the infrastructure challenge by creating a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank to expand and enhance, not supplant, existing federal transportation investments. This independent entity will be directed to invest in our nations most challenging transportation infrastructure needs. The Bank will receive an infusion of federal money, $60 billion over 10 years, to provide financing to transportation infrastructure projects across the nation. These projects will create up to two million new direct and indirect jobs and stimulate approximately $35 billion per year in new economic activity. * Allow Americans to buy their medicines from other developed countries if the drugs are safe and prices are lower outside the U.S. * Will provide the CDC $50 million in new funding to determine the most effective approaches that assist not only navigation of cancer patients through diagnosis and treatment processes, but also provide easy-to-understand information on the necessary follow-up steps to ensure continued lifelong health. ..."
"The will of a tiny, sniveling group of sore-loser assholes, who dont necessarily oppose healthcare reform, but *very much* oppose a black President having any kind of lasting legacy on American society. Thats the bottom line."
"Thats a very good point. It is law. So why the delays and exemptions, which are in fact changes to the law? Should a president or his/her administration be able to change a law without a vote? "
I would love for any lib to answer me one question tho. If the ACA is a good thing then why did the senators themselves push to be excluded from it?
"Its a step in the right direction, but for now all it really does is force all the young healthy people to start giving money to the pharmaceutical companies. "
"The will of the people? what a joke, over half of American does NOT want Obamacare now, according to multiple polls as of I dont know... the entire last 6 months? "
"[More Disapprove as opposed to approved as of June 2013](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163253/americans-wary-health-law-impact.aspx) RCP average of all polls is [52 against, 38 for](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html) /r/politics of all places should know that congress doesnt necessarily follow the will of the people. And even George Bush can win a second term."
"conservatives live in a self-reinforcing echo chamber, socially and media-wise reality doesnt have anything to do with their passion, convictions or beliefs "
"A big chunk of the country does not want/need all the bullshit that this will ruin, also its easy to get shit passed when you have over half the government getting paid by the same people who are passing the bills. There is no room for rational discourse since you have to support those who will keep paying you and never let you get fired."
Does the will of the people include a bill being slammed through congress? Passed by a democrat controlled house and senate? A bill that even the speaker of the house at the time stated even she didnt read it. Oh yeah the Will of the people and Im pretty sure Obama didnt win a second term running on the idea of Obama care. 
"I was fine with it until there was a mandate, now I will have to drop my current plan and get a different one to afford it. For my family this is terrible. edit: whats to downvote? i dont deserve a choice?"
"Every time I see Boehner doing his will of the people soundbite, I want to smack the lie out of his mouth. The President ran his re-election campaign in large part on Obamacare, Romney ran opposed - the **PEOPLE** went with Obama &amp; his care. And it wasnt even CLOSE: 4.9 million over Mittens. The Senate had 21 Democratic seats up for grabs, yet the PEOPLE not only left them in power but also added 2 more seats to their majority. In the House, not only did the GOP lose seats they came within 17 seats of losing control. But the biggest indication of the Peoples Will is that 1.7 million more voters went with Democratic candidates than with Republican. So, yeah, Mr. Speaker, the People of United States have sent you a message: STFU. "
"The Republicans are scared shitless that the Affordable Care Act will be a success. Because if they fail and the ACA is successful the Republicans are doomed. They have campaigned for 3 straight years on repealing the ACA. If it turns out to be successful they are screwed. They wont have a policy to stand on. They will be demolished in 2014 and lose again in 2016. They have no choice but to dig their heels in right here right now and hope that the ACA is never fully implemented. And theyve picked a damn good time to have the fight. 14 months until Congressional re-elections, no real risk of losing the House, and a decent chance of grabbing a few more seats in the Senate. Bastards."
"Because he lied about it. People elected him on what they thought Obamacare would be, but he was lying and now the people dont want it anymore. He sold it with lines like We will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan. Period. but that turned out to be false."
"in the same manner that a mob cant vote to massacre a group of people, you cant vote to fine people just for existing which is what obamacare does"
"Its a joke hes got bigger fish to fry how about helping Americans get jobs instead of pushing this ineffective, not to mention expensive agenda... Everyone will be healthy with no jobs! He keeps switching agendas when his current one goes bad and when it does and blames it on someone else but Im sure hes happy to take full credit for this... Better question is how many people actually want it? "
"This reminds me of the Canadian version of Breaking Bad they tried to make. A high school chemistry teacher is diagnosed with cancer. He receives world class treatment in a timely manner that he does not have to pay out of pocket for thanks to Canadian Medicare, and he is able to continue teaching and supporting his family. The first episode was also the last. "
"The will of the people was disregarded because it isnt the Universal Healthcare that it was sold as initially. Seems to me, and I could be wrong, but that this was some big ploy to get insurers more customers. Now everyone is mandated to get insurance, or pay a fine. That doesnt do anything but line certain peoples pockets, either with enforced insurance or with fees and penalties. There is no universal option and now people are basically coerced into purchasing it from the existing insurers. Its not as if it actually insured anyone who couldnt afford it, it basically now makes them pay for something they cant, otherwise they are fined. So this doesnt really solve anything, but it makes the insurance companies a but load more money and the people who hold out will make the government money through fines. Now maybe my understanding of this is completely flawed, but this is what seems to be the case to me. Can someone please let me know if this is in fact a correct assumption, and if not, correct me as far as the details?"
"These are the same asshats who refuse to believe science, so yeah, logic isnt exactly their strong suit."
I suppose you can say the same about prohibition.
"Half the country knows nothing about the ACA and is against it for knee jerk reasons that fox news fed them. Its cool if you know what youre talking about and disagree with it, people have different views and that is a good thing but most anyone Ive come across that are anti Obamacare has no idea what it actually is. As of the 1st of the year I can afford Kaiser healthcare for me and my family. Not a weird government run health insurance, THE SAME plan they offer now, only affordable. All I gotta look out for is those damn nazi death panels. /sarcasm "
"The will of the corporate people count as people, mere citizens are just walking votes, to be lied to as needed."
"Up to this point, the will of the people HAS been disregarded: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html"
"Ok, how about this: No subsidies for Government workers at Capitol Hill...currently they will receive a 80% taxpayer funded subsidy towards their Healthcare. No Subsidies for Congress or the House on THEIR Healthcare...let them find their Health Insurance on the Exchanges...just like the rest of us. Employers are exempted from ACA until 2015...lets do this exemption for the INDIVIDUAL too, NO penalties (which are called TAXES, HENCE the Supreme Courts decision) if your Employer doesnt contribute (like MY Employer doesnt either). ...lets see if Democrats vote YES for that...defend ALL THE EXEMPTIONS that others get, but YOU dont, as a regular person. btw...WHY wont the UNIONS get behind the ACA? They said that Employers dont hire Full-time (only Part Timers) anymore, so they dont have to abide to the Employer Mandate starting 2015. Riddle me all of this, thanks!"
Lets please try to refer to the law as the Affordable Care Act or the ACA. Referring to it as Obamacare just play into the hands of the critics.
"The republicans are so focused on making people suffer.. there is no other explanation. They oppose healthcare to end suffering of millions, so they shut down the government and cause more suffering. WTF? Vote these assholes out!"
"The fact that they passed it without reading it, and then exempted themselves. Also, the fact that it turned out to be really not that affordable--as a North Carolinian, my premiums have already gone up quite a bit, and Im scared that my employer will drop me, leaving my wife and eight-month-old daughter without any health insurance."
Can some-one explain why Obamacare is different than healthcare in Holland or in Denmark (where it is free)?
Wasnt there an entire thread about all the negative effects of obamacare? like the limits on prices being removed from critical medications so pharmas could charge whatever they wanted?
because fox news pundits say so!
Cause the inherent flaw of democracy is that a vocal minority can make a big stink about something the majority put in place. 
"Its all happening so gradually, I wonder if well ever get to a Bastille."
"At this point, its a little late to be debating the will of the people. I mean the ACA has been passed and upheld, and now it is law that it be funded. You dont get to do polls and reassess at every step of the way. "
"Maybe Im just not a team player but I cant honestly understand why theres not more decent amongst democrats about the ACA than there is. I voted for Obama the first time when he said he was going to do things a lot differently than what actually happened. What we got with the ACA though is just garbage compared to what we were promised. People are losing working hours and being moved to part time just so employers can get out of paying for their insurance. A convenient loophole that congress just so happened to not think about. This isnt even hyperbole as it happened to me and the rest of the staff where I worked. So now Im getting payed less and Im going to either have to pay a fine or buy some insurance plan that literally wont pay for itself unless something catastrophic happens with what little I have. I dont get it when people say well its better than if we did nothing because if we had done nothing Id still be full time and Id be able to afford insurance. Dont dismiss me because I disagree with you, I just dont want to be told that this is what I wanted when I voted for healthcare reform."
"well.. dem here and obama supporter. a majority dont like obamacare. but a majority dont want it defunded. if you look into the numbers of the majority who dont like obamacare.. a large amount of those folks dont think it is left wing enough also if you look into the numbers, you will see a very large portion of people who dont like Obamacare, dont like it based on lies they heard on fox news. One of the big ones is 50% of everyone over 65 thinks that Obamacare increased their costs during the doughnut hole rather than reality which is he got rid of the doughnut hole for just about all of them. A large number think their medicare was cut to pay for obamacare, when in reality not a single thing was cut.. services were actually expanded, we negotiated a better deal with providers. when these people learn the truth, their support will flip on a dime. last support increases dramatically for Obamacare, especially from republicans if you call it by its real name, the affordable care act. See The term Obama has been successfully demonized by the right."
"Im sure someone has already mentioned this (right?) but the basic explanation/rationale seems simple: In our system we basically have to pick between two people (and their parties) in each election. We might not agree with everything they support. So, for instance, if LGBT rights are important to me, Obama DID end DADT, so even if I dont support the ACA*, I would vote for Obama. The republican system of government is not a direct democracy, and it happens fairly often that the will of the people is not represented, because of the limited effect of electing officials can have. This is by design; there was considerable concern among the founding fathers about mob rule and the tyranny of the majority - this is partially, for instance, why the electoral college system exists - in case the average citizen votes for some fanatic, cooler heads might prevail and prevent that. (Thats the *theory*.) Its quite possible that Health Care Reform, is a disliked portion of a generally liked Democratic Party Platform. Since its core to their platform, however, they cant just say Eh, people dont like it, since that would be letting the republicans score points. Of course I havent looked at the poll numbers, but Im saying this to illustrate that just because a party is elected does not mean ALL their positions are popular. I think we can all think of some positions politicians are loathe to take, even if they are highly popular; the two party system almost guarantees that will happen on some issues). Of course, what is the true will of the people is so vague and inherently contentious that its almost impossible to find reliable information about it - polling can be contaminated in countless ways from the phrasing of questions to bad sampling. The perception we have as individuals is heavily marked by the environments we inhabit and the people we socialize with. (*:I hope you dont mind the acronym for Affordable Care Act, rather than the slightly loaded term Obamacare)"
"These guys are truly in denial. Ive heard several times recently the ACA referred to as the healthcare bill, as if it was still up for debate and hasnt been the law of the land for two years. Idiots."
Maybe because our entire system is corrupt to the core? Universal healthcare is very reasonable but it needs to be done right. We waste such enormous amounts of money on ridiculous things. 
"People say things like this as if Obama won his second term in a landslide. The popular vote was very very close. How can 51% of americans voting for him indicate support for Obamacare in any way? How many single issue voters are there that were voting for him because of abortion, gay rights or other liberal social hot button topics? To claim that a Democratcic congress (which was kicked out after they passed it) and a Democratic president passed this law so it must be the will of the people is idiotic. The majority of Americans oppose Obamacare. I am sure it because of all the lies evil republicans have fed them though, right? Did you ever think that your Democratic leaders were feeding you their own lies to get you on their side? Of course not becase Democrats are good and pure and Republicans are just pure evil. The only reason anyone would oppose Obamacare is because they want the elderly, children and puppies to die in the gutters so they can increase profits? Get over yourselves. There are serious problems with state run healthcare, and we will see them slowly play out over the next decade. That is why the law was enacted over a timeline, so the harms to the system will be gradual and no one will be able to point and blame it for crashing the system and massively increasing the costs of healthcare and insurance while decreasing the quality provided."
"Im a 30 year old male in great health. Never had any problems aside from a few broken bones when I was a child. Two years ago I was paying $80/month for insurance that included a $3000 out of pocket expense. It slowly increased to $90, then to $110, then to $120. A couple days ago I received a letter saying that because of Obamacare, my premium will be going up to $240 per month. How is this suppose to make sense?"
"Im not sure I would call with the Supreme Court did upholding Obama care. It should have been voted down and sent back with an opinion, change this wording and admit it is a tax then vote again pass it when everyone understands what it is. "
"Never underestimate a disgruntled group of sore losers. Many business owners and corporations who have not been providing any health care to their workers suddenly will have to, and what bugs republicans more than anything? A hit to their donors pocketbook."
"hating democrats is enough to claim the will of the people is being disregarded. in reality, the ACA is based on romneycare. obama looked at it and agreed it looks like a good idea. this thing is as bipartisan as anything could ever be. but its the fact that obama likes it is the reason the GOP is now vehemently against it."
"Congress has a &lt; 9% approval rating. Id say anything they do now (and then) has been usurped by special interests, most importantly ALEC. Obama wasnt doing it for the people, he was doing it for the corporations. "
"Honest Question: I always understood insurance companies served the capacity of reining in medical costs by negotiation with hospitals, is that true? If it is, would it be worth keeping them around? If it isnt, is there some way we can incentive them to do so? "
"My parents are against ACA; yet, my father enthusiastically told me that he would no longer worry that I would be denied healthcare due to existing conditions."
"the main problem is not will of people. if we take will of people, lot of laws would have to be repealed. the problem is, trying to get your preferences putting a gun to the head of budget or debt ceiling. if this works. we dont need no president or congress for that matter. what if democrats block the budget CR when a republican is president saying they wont pass one until they make the minimum wage $15/hr."
"It would be nice if data constrained mobile users could get a copy paste of the text, perhaps in the OP. I hate clicking a link and seeing about 8 videos load."
"I was one of the people who benefited from Obama extending the age someone can be covered under their parents from 25 to 26. Because of that change, I was only without insurance from my birthday in 2010 until January 1st, 2011 (less than a month) and now I have my own insurance. I am still unsure on the matter. My uncle needs good coverage to pay for his cancer treatment, if he were forced to switch to a lesser plan then I would be against it. Also, my Father who is getting up there in age is unhappy because his company has had to drastically downgrade his coverage plan while charging him slightly more money. I know my experience isnt a big enough sample size so thats why I am still torn on this issue. I dont like how its more about what the Dems can do and what the Repubs can stop the Dems from doing, instead of just being about the voice of the people. There may not be 1 plan that fits everyone."
"We wanted a single-payer system, not a compulsory for profit insurance hegemony running healthcare."
http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obamacare-website-quietly-deletes-reference-free-health-care_757348.html Because it was a BATE AND SWITCH
"Suggesting that because people voted in favour of Obama (or in general any political candidate under a FPTP voting system) they support *all* of that candidates proposals is silly. The USA, like most first past the post voting countries, is a two party state. This isnt the fault of the American people, its just the nature of the voting system that given enough time two parties will emerge as dominant ([Duvergers Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvergers_law#Duverger.27s_Law.27s_converse)). This means that you likely no longer vote in favour of the candidates you most agree with (perhaps an independent) but have to vote tactically to avoid letting someone you really dont agree with getting power. There is so much more to it than what Ive briefly said but my point is that ultimately you cannot decisively say that the will of the people has or has not been disregarded (based on voting patterns) because the political system itself doesnt accurately represent how people feel. Edit: And I am not making any kind of opinion about Obamacare here - I dont even live in the USA - Im just pointing out that what people want isnt necessarily what they vote for."
"ANNNNND Democrats got more votes by the american people in the 2012 elections for the house then the republicans, it was because of the way they set up districts that we are having this shit show in D.C"
Paying for more peoples healthcare = not being able to hire more workers.
Shut up you communists. 
I just think we should stop spending as much money.
People didnt even read it. The people were deceived.
"By passing legislation without a single Republican vote/attempt to compromise. There are a lot of Americans that think this legislation is going to be a disaster, and the implementation problems that keep coming up are making that look more and more likely. "
"Can someone explain this to me? This is stupid, I know, but I dont understand it. Say I dont have a job, im still being fined for not having health insurance? Say I have a shit job and im barely making enough for rent, im still required to pay for health insurance? "
Just wish the tea party republicans could be declared domestic economic terrorists and hauled off to Gitmo for indefinite detetion where they can do no harm to American people. 
Because the GOP and their pals in big corporations dont like it. Those are the people whose wills Republicans care about. 
"The really stupid thing is that a Government shutdown still wont stop ACA from going into effect or being funded. Obamacare is already a *fait accompli*. It is already funded. Shutting down the Government has no effect on it. Its just a childish tantrum from a bunch of entitled babies who just cant handle it that Obama kicked their ass in two elections. The Tea Party is a cancer thats killing the GOP and the GOP rihly deserves it. Theyve pandered to the lowest common denominator so long they are now owned by it. Two words for all the teabaggers still out there: Hillary, bitches."
Does anyone one here that supports the ACA currently have health insurance? just curious...
Can anyone explain to me what the ACA even did? Minus the 80/20 rule and a few other small policy changes all I see now is that I am REQUIRED by law to buy healthcare :[
"The will of the dumbest of the dumbest, the racists, the partisan assholes and most importantly the BILLIONAIRES has been subverted. The billionaires took the time to create the teabaggers so they can hate that dirty black president and do the bidding of the billionaires and somehow a bare minimum health care plan passed so these teabaggers have to stand their ground and make sure that poor people do as they are meant to do, work slave wages, consume, procreate, get sick and DIE! The only people in this country that deserve proper health care are the ones smart enough to be born into a rich family and live lives of luxury their entire life making money off the work of the peons."
"only in America is healthcare this big of an issue, regardless whether it is Obamacare, or not. "
We had to pass it in order to understand it... how the F does that work?
"Im all for debating the benefits of Obamacare, or making some snide remark on the topic attacking either Democrats or Republicans...but am I the only one whos wondering when the entirety of Congress got elected based on Obamacare...or when Obama turned it into the *only* campaign issue he was running on? Obama won because of far more issues, as did other people in Congress now...to assume that it was passed with the will of the people is a little unusual. It was passed by a majority-Democrat Congress, which subsequently lost the House...I could easily say thats the result of Obamacare passing. In short, correlation is not causation, and while I like the idea of healthcare reform (perhaps even Obamacare, I confess Im not well-versed enough in the gigantic impacts it may or may not have to make that call), to say that it was passed with the will of the people is...unusual. I mean, the Supreme Court has judges who were appointed 15-20 years ago, so theres no guarantee they represent the will of *todays* people. Thats not even their purpose; the judicial mandate doesnt state it has to represent the will of the people, and the precedent set since Marshall has been that their biggest job is purely to judge constitutionality of laws. So while you may rightly (or wrongly) agree with Obamacare, that *does not mean it is passed with the will of the people of today*. I mean, lets look at a poll: [This link shows that a plurality of voters think that it shouldnt be repealed, but that doesnt mean they *like it*, which is what is being discussed. Keep in mind this could have been influenced by *how* Republicans are going about trying to defund it, so the poll does have some likely bias.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/09/30/new-poll-only-one-third-of-americans-support-repealing-defunding-or-delaying-obamacare/) Here is likely where Republicans base their arguments against it, regarding it not being what people want: [Basically, a plurality (same as always, not a true majority though) have continually said that they think its a bad idea. However, that isnt to say it really is, or that it should be repealed; just that its not a good idea.](http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/15/20506193-poll-obamacare-remains-highly-unpopular-as-implementation-looms?lite) So yeah, its a lot more complex than Congress passed it, and even though Democrats lost the next election to the House immediately after passing it, Obama won and that was clearly cause of Obamacare! Oh, and judges appointed 10-20 years ago are still up with the times and doing what the people want! Lets not fall into that, and instead decide This is a horrible way of going about it, and people dont want it handled like this, so stop doing it."
"In the manner that we all hate what the NSA is doing and they still do it. Just because we get ONE thing that we wanted does not mean that the will of the people is being upheld. Not even close. Cut back on defense spending, or atleast increase education spending. Is that happening? No, in fact the opposite, they are increasing defense spending and cutting back education. Is the will of the people being uphelp now?"
"I dont agree with Obamacare and here is why. Starting tomorrow, October 1st, 2013, Obamacare goes into action. Simultaneously, the to pay for this new form of healthcare, the government is cutting other programs. My father is a military veteran who served in the Navy for 22 years, and our healthcare (Tricare Prime) is getting butchered. Not only is our premium and deductible going way up, but if I get sick the closest doctor I can go see is 45 minutes away. Now, a 45 minute drive isnt *that* insane, but as a broke college student, the fact that I cant go to my colleges student health center is friggin ridiculous. "
In the manner that the Plutocrats oppose it.
"The will of the VERY RICH people has been disregarded, of course. You know: the only people whose will actually *matters* in the US. Who fucking **cares** what the peasants think? /s"
Youre not people unless you have money
Some of us wanted to keep our 40 hour work week and employer supplied insurance. 
"I live in a third world country, we are still shaping up here and we have a lot to focus on our side but watching the US crumble breaks my heart. "
None of that is evidence that the will of the people was taken into account.
But what about the minority vote that won republicans a majority in the house......
wow... talk about a biased article
cant we fire our state represneatives?!
"Well, congress is the representation of the people, so technically congress can claim that anything that is rejected by congress is against the will of the people. The will of the people being the will of congress."
"The will of the people was not disregarded, its the exact opposite. Con filth are trying to kill two birds with one stone - shut down the government (because they claim to hate it, even as they suck on its tit), and repeal Obamacare, which will soon prove to be a good thing. Because once people find out its a good thing, they will remember those con filth who tried to take it away from them. Will of the people? Whens the last time the GOP gave a shit about that?"
LOL @ Murica.
They should be arrested for treason unless they can prove a popular mandate from their district only 
If Republicans are so clairvoyant about the effects of Obamacare what the fuck happened in 2008 when the subprime mortgages crisis collapsed the economy? When countless economists were warning us about this bubble that was about to pop for years prior. 
"Furthermore, they dont currently have the votes. Period. They are a minority party with a minority position in government who has been roundly rejected in national elections, and they dont even have the votes to implement their current strategy within our congressional system, and yet are still acting like they are entitled to their entire rejected agenda. They are a fundamentally anti-democratic party. If they are voted in, theyll govern like George W. Bush. If theyre voted out, theyll just try to break the system. Whatever rationale they are using at any given time is just completely made up propaganda for doing the exact same thing, and they will use the exact opposite reasoning when the shoe is on the other foot. If you pay real attention to politics for a year or two, this is indisputable and the GOP is not a democratically acceptable party anymore."
"I think the problem is misinformation and lack of understanding of this Healthcare plan. Its a decent plan, the great thing about it though is it attempts many different facets and will be tweaked over the next 10 years to figure out what works best and what doesnt. Its gonna be an evolving system, which is great!"
Anyone else feel strange that congress excluded themselves from Obama-care and they are making the tax payers subsidize 75% of their own families healthcare?
"Maybe Im fucking missing the concept here, whats so hated about Obamacare. Let me make sure I grasp it : Every American will be required to have some type of an insurance policy, and insurance policies have new requirements. (I dont fully grasp how someone is required to be covered, but, sure.) So, people who are already covered (paying for it through a benefit offered by your job, say) have essentially no change. People who werent previously covered (work somewhere without benefits/dont work/etc) are now being forced to pay some kind of monthly bill. Note, after some research, Im seeing numbers of $11 a month and $23 a month in a couple of states, and thats for a *family of four*. Obviously its bare bones, but its better than nothing. So who is this group of people incredibly upset? It seems like everyone with a good job and smooth life is already covered and will have no changes. It seems like people who werent covered before are, yes, forced to pay some money a month, but its an amount that Id be shocked to find out they couldnt afford. Please dont lend me your horseshit about $11 a month is tough for some. If its tough for some, Im going to need to see how exactly Obamacare forces you to pay for these things. I imagine homeless people wont be paying for health insurance. http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx After reading that, I dont fully grasp why people dislike it so much. Is it really just because people feel forced to buy something, and feel that is unconstitutional? You pay taxes constantly, thats paying for something you might not want, why isnt that unconstitutional. Jesus."
"I honestly just cant wrap my head around why this is such an issue in the US. We had complete universal healthcare as early as the fifties in The Netherlands. Every other rich, developed democracy has it. How is this not common sense? "
"Excellent unverifiable anecdote, Internet stranger! I knew a guy from France and he said that socialized health care was the worst and that he goes to America to pay for all his surgeries because of long lines! As far as we know, all these things are true facts!"
"Dont assume any of those august bodies represent the will of the people or that selecting Obama over the dreadful McCain/Palin is a ringing endorsement of anything. I oppose it on philosophical grounds (it uses the IRS to essentially operate as indirect knee-breakers for poorly regulated private insurance concerns) and practical ones (single payer would work better) That said the ACA has yet to actually go into effect, it might work out fine or it might prove to implode. We do not know yet."
"But recent polls are saying... (blah, blah, blah)"
"The fact that the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate under the ACA doesnt mean it was in accord with the will of the people today. It means that it was in accord with the Constitution, which was created in 1787 and last amended in 1992. "
"When I was in grade school, 2 kids ran for Class President. One wanted every Tuesday to be Pizza Day. The other didnt. We elected the Pizza Kid. He got the Principal to sign off on Pizza Day every Tuesday. All the kids loved pizza. He even got the PTA to endorse the plan by promising to remove Soda from the lunchroom. Then the kid who lost and his cousins cut the brake lines on the Cafeteria Delivery Truck and we had to shut down the cafeteria for a week. The other kids beat up on those couple who didnt like the Pizza until they moved back to Alabama."
"Working in the restaurant industry, I can tell you this law will hurt the people its supposed to help more then it helps them. In my area most restaurants are dropping people to less than 30 hrs/wk since they cant afford coverage for them. So these people (who make close to minimum wage) now will likely have to get a second job just to pay for healthcare because they cant afford the tax if they dont. I cant imagine those people are very happy about that. "
"Its nothing but ranting and raving by poor losers. They ought to look a bit closer at their hero, Ted Cruz, who gets his insurance subsidized by Goldman Sachs, a company that was bailed out by the rest of us. Shocking how little his fans care. "
Most polls show that a majority of the people do not want it. That is the manner in which their will is being disregarded. 
 not everyone voted for Obama and his retarded ideas
"Because people dont want it. And by dont want they mean we want it but dont want to pay for it. Generally speaking, of course."
"I think youre forgetting the legislative process there which is the most important part. If constituents dont want it then it shouldnt be passed. Being elected President after campaigning for Obamacare shouldnt be seen as a sign the country wants it, just seen as a sign that they think Obama would be a better President than Romney. If people are talking to their representatives and telling them they dont want it and they are passing the bill anyway then that means the will of the people is being disregarded."
"As someone strongly against govt healthcare, I would never argue that the peoples will was disregarded. Initially, you could make that argument. Now I just think the population is much stupider than I could have ever imagined. We are definitely getting what we asked for. "
"The Republicans know whats going to happen. Old people are going to pay less for healthcare and will realize the Republicans are full of shit. They are willing to shut down government to prevent this from happening. Think about that. They are willing to shut down the government and hurt the country to stop legislation that they say will...hurt the country. If the ACA is so awful, why not let it run for a year, fuck up the country, and then the Republicans can fucking clean up in the midterm elections and repeal it without worrying about a veto? Could it be because they know the opposite will happen?"
In our form of government as designed by the founders the peoples will was almost irrelevant in the national government. A republic is designed to ensure that wise men are elected as leaders and they will make decisions as laws based on what they believe is the best corse of action. The republicans were elected by their constituents and are governing or attempting to on the basis of what they believe is right. Simply put the will of the people should have no role in the healthcare decision 
"For most people, it will be more expensive than what they already have. I think some of the less educated people think that they are getting free healthcare. Truth is, poor people have always had free healthcare if they were truly poor. Some people didnt buy it because they thought it was too expensive but those same people had smartphone, nice cars, and houses that are too big for a realistic budget. My healthcare premiums are going from $615 to over $1100 per month under Obamacare. This is not Affordable Healthcare. This is a dumb law and if you look, the people who passed the law are exempt from it or are getting subsidies because it is too expensive. (Congress, unions). Its a sham of the first order."
Shirley you mean the will of the people who bought the politicians?
"According to my local libertarian (hes just a conservative that likes to toss the words free market around) talk show host the majority of Americans dont want this! Where hegets that statistic, he never says. "
How is it that they are attacking Obama on healthcare yet mostly ignore the NSA scandal. I dont think they intend to accomplish anything with this farce. It is just some tactic used to distract people from focusing on other issues. It is a popular topic and so long as America is divided they can keep up the pretense of addressing an important issue. And I mean both sides really dont give a shit theyre both content with the status quo.
This justification works for literally anything the government does
"I love debating this with the opposing side, because they rarely know much about the law and just use a bunch of Fox News talking points in retort. Sort of like arguing with my 5 year old."
"Inaccuracy in the article: &gt;When a reporter asked Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) on Saturday what he would do **if** his efforts to defund Obamacare should fail, Issa stuck his nose into the reporter?s face and shrilled, ?How dare you presume a failure? How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?? What actually happened was that the reporter asked a loaded question by saying what will happen **when** newest CR fails. The reporter added bias to his question which is what caused the congressman to shrill.

None of those institutions necessarily pursue the will of the people.
"We dont live in a democracy but a constitutional republic, and the will of the people has very little to do with constitutional rights. If Americans understood that, there would be way less problems, since then youd realize you cant just do whatever you want, even if you have the majority behind you, and so unless you pass an amendment that says Congress has the power to fine someone for not doing something that is not against the law, then Obamacare is unconstitutional. The headline sums up how people dont understand the meaning of constitutionality. Just because Congress and the Executive say something does not make it constitutional, notwithstanding a Judiciary opinion from a corrupt body, especially given its 5-4. The Roberts courts opinion re Obamacare is as legitimate as Rehnquists (ugh) 2000 opinion installing Bush Jr. Nay, its not a single opinion but the court itself, what dont you get? "
"The people dont get to vote directly (federally) on laws. Theres a reason for this the founders anticipated: mob mentality. If we did, blacks would likely have been slaves and segregated longer or even to this day. Without a representative Republic, the majority could and would take advantage of the minority. Republicans are citing polls that lead the participants into skewed results to say on this one, singular law, that we should have mob rule because, umm, freedom. Ill bet they wouldnt welcome a national vote on raising the capital gains tax rate. "
"&gt;So in what manner was the will of the people disregarded? Most dont have a clue how they will be affected, will of the people is pure BS, as that was not the only thing that people used to decide who to vote for. All current national polls shows the majority dont want it. That would mean the only ones listening to their constituents is the Republicans. Congress is exempt. President is exempt. Leading Senate Democrats are talking as we speak, Still nothing about Jobs, Economy, Health Care for All, just more BS about ACA and Gun Grabbing. People actually think these cronies, are on anyones side but themselves and their rich buddies? When it finally fails, maybe we can have universal health care then. Cant believe so many hate the poor. What will ACA do for the Poor? According to Kaiser and HealthCare.gov, if the state doesnt expand Medicaid, they are still screwed."

Obamacare was 0% of his 2012 campaign...probably because Romneycare was so similar.
They mean the will of the wealthy people. The rest of us are livestock. we think were people in the way a dog or a chimp does when they sit at a dinner table in a behaved or dignified manner. Only corporations are people. Its easy to mix up the distinction. You are just an animal after all. 
"I dont understand how the ACA is going to affect me. Im 25, a student and unemployed. How am I supposed to pay for healthcare?"
"If you make under a million dollars a year you are not a person to the Republican party, thats how the will of the people was disregarded to them. "
"The courts and the senate and the house do not actually work for us, or reflect our desires. They work for the highest bidder. Those who can buy the most lobbyists, control the law. "
"Im of mixed opinion on this, on one hand yay for everyone getting health care but on the other, the fucking thing is going to end up costing me 40% of my current employers contributions to my health care plan which is over $300 a month. Itd be cheaper to drop my health care plan and buy my own but I dont have that option."
"It wasnt the will of the people who elected these particular Congresspeople. Remember that a lot of these guys got elected by moving farther to the right than the incumbent Republican and vowing to go to Washington and repeal Obamacare, never vote for a tax increase, and basically fight the Satan Obama and all his works. If they dont engage in these histrionics and make a fuss, then in the next primary, there will be someone even farther to the right that they are who will promise to do more. This in itself is an argument against term limits for congress. Imagine what this would be like without Boehner there to try and temper them."
"Something so large and critical to the American condition needs to have a multiyear timeline for public discussion thats moderated by our elected officials instead of dictated by our elected officials. What both of political parties are pushing for is rushed and not well thought out. Do you really believe this will be a well implemented program? Do you believe that there is a good alternative proposal? - If they wanted to really do whats best for the people, youd see: ? An honest 10 year timeline for implementation (small pieces at a time starting at year 4-5) ? Quarterly televised national debates by experts in the field (i.e. non politicians) on baseline fundamental components (effectiveness, resources needed, cost per person, fallback plan, and implementation) ? Citizen voting on milestones that set the fundamental components in place piece by piece so to ensure a smooth implementation. ? Postmortem to ensure all components of the program were implemented properly. - What youre getting is political theater thats going to cost a lot, be poorly implemented, and has no real competitor provided by the competing political parties. Our elected officials are lost and were following them deeper into the forest. Good luck......"
"You misread that. The will of corporate-paid Texas Republicans was not upheld. If you look more closely, it is in the fine print."
As an undergraduate I wrote a thesis that touches on lots of topics discussed in this thread. Specifically it compared ACA reform with the German health system. Some of you might find parts of it interesting. Its amateur but not a horrible read. http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/55461/browse?value=Budros%2C+Michael&amp;type=author Edit: added missing words 
"50%-ish of the voters voted for Obama. Only 50%-ish of Americans vote. So, Im not all that inclined to worry about what this 25% minority of people have to say, if Im honest..."
"Sign it to see whats in it. The cornerstone of a working, viable democracy."
this bill relies on the young people to sign up or the rates skyrocket for everyone else .Many people I have spoken to said they rather pay a penalty at the end of the year instead of about 3000 over the year for coverage that they dont think theyd use .Rather have a big screen tv and playstation 
Congress and the President dont swear an oath to uphold the will of the people they represent. 
also California is already complaining that the bill doesnt cover illegal aliens .I mean they are here illegally and dont deserve any benefits 
Teaparty crybaby bitches didnt get exactly what they want. Thats how. They want their medicare but the rest of us can fuck off.
"1. Healthcare does indeed need some type of reform. When people get sick, or are victims of accidents, there should be nobody that profits as a direct result. 2. ACA is not the best way to go about that reform. 3. Using the threat of a government shutdown as leverage to get what you want is a tactic developed in pre-school, like a temper tantrum, and has no place among grownups. 4. If I had tried something like this to get my way as a child, I would have gotten my ass whooped."
"Reddit aside, ACA is actually pretty unpopular because of two things that work very well against it: 1. Nobody knows anything about it 2. except that the GOP links it to socialism; something that, through great effort, has become a bit of a bad word in the US I would like to say that I support the ACA, but I admit that I dont know shit about it. I know you can have insurance on your kids until theyre 26 now, something else about pre-existing conditions, and that my workplace cant subsidize marketplace insurance plans because of an agreement between them and their current provider (which sucks, I was really looking forward to finding a more personalized insurance plan with the help of my employers existing contribution). Those are all really cool things according to a lot of us here on reddit, but this is a HUGE program and im a bit disappointed with Obama &amp; Co. for not making the details more accessible to people who dont feel like staring at a wall of text (myself)."
"Can someone please tell me how ObamaCare helps the poor? Do they get free medical care? Do they get any free medications or free wellness checkups? all I see is a few good provisions (like the examption from preexisting condition) but no real care the democrats keep saying think of the poor children and The republicans dont want poor people getting healthcare but what healthcare are they now getting for free?????? also by OPs logic, the will of the people is with the Patriot Act, FISA and wiretapping?"
"The will of the people in some very republican districts has been disregarded by the majority of people in the country....Thats called a Democracy. From their standpoint, a Majority can stop on you has bad as a Dictator, if you dont agree with the Majority."
"When did you start thinking the congress and Obama represents the actual will of the people. America is the illusion of democracy. Why should I be forced to pay for people who cannot, or will even make efforts to try. We have let people think that it is ok for the government to piggy back them and in this effort they support the government. It is akin to a bribe to the people telling them the government cares about them and is doing good thing. The interests of the American Empire are being looked after, not the people. Its to late for the people already. Now it is slash and burn and lie or fall on our faces. I would rather watch America burn than do wrong to save it."
"retards and morons think that somehow the president has broken the rules.. he has not. the people want this. the only ones who dont are morons, imbeciles, and CEOs in the healthcare industry..."
Most people in this country are stupid and our elections are a sham. Few of us were intelligent enough to vote outside of the hopeless two party system.
"You are all hypocrites. I hate it. Look, this is the same damn Congress that lied to ALL OF US about the NSA and its practices. Reddit as a whole has been campaigning for Congress to be thrown to the dogs for MONTHS because of that. And now Congress and the government is suddenly the voice of the people? This is how they get away with this kind of shit. If youre against the practices of a government, dont make it piecemeal. These people will abuse the power we give them, one hundred percent of the time. And worse yet, youre all behind the Democrats as if the Republicans are the only ones raping us! As if the Democrats will treat us any better! Well, SURPRISE REDDIT, youre getting exactly what you deserve. Maybe one day youll realize that Democrats and Republicans are the same damn people with the same damn agenda. Maybe itll snow in hell, too."
"For starters, consider the way it was passed. Republicans were not allowed to offer amendments and special rules were invoked to allow cloture without 60 votes. In other words, it was rammed through by political force. I guess that means its OK to stop it the same way."
"In a 7?2 decision written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the Supreme Court denied Dred Scotts request and in doing so, ruled an Act of Congress to be unconstitutional for the second time in its history. The Court held that African Americans, whether slave or free, could not be American citizens and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court,and that the federal government had no power to regulate slavery in the federal territories acquired after the creation of the United States. So, we could reinstate slavery and the left should shut up about it because it was the law of the land and the Supreme Court upheld its practice? We should or could reinstate [prohibition]. It was the law of the land and a constitutional amendment. The left should shut up about the Citizens United Supreme Court decision After all, the Supreme court upheld it."
"BECAUSE A GUY LIKE JESUS WOULS HAVE NEVER PROVIDED SOMETHING LIKE CARE FOR THE SICK. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO BUSY BUILDING A GIANT FENCE IN TEXAS AND THROWING ALL THE DIRTY MEXICANS TO THE SIDE OF IT WHERE THE BELONG. AND GUNS. AND IF CAPITALISM SAYS YOU CAN WORK FOR $1/HR THEN THATS YOUR WAGE, PLUS ABORTION IS BAD. Honestly none of this shit makes a drop of sense unless you think, Who stands to lose the most money/gain the most money on this issue and who do those rich people support. There, thats why. Rich people who stand to lose money dont give a fuck about the will of the people, the president, congress, or the Supreme Court. They dont give a fuck about Jesus or the Tea Party or Occupy Wall Street. They dont give a fuck about Jon Stewart, Rush Limbaugh, Msnbc, Or Fox News. They give a fuck about their bank account. Take away their ability to control anything with their bank account. The rest means literally nothing."
"Polls show it to be very unpopular. I dont want to federal Govt involved in my health care. This is the same govt that spies on me, taxes me too much, wages wars without my consent, polices the world, and is massively corrupt across party lines. What if we have another Bush running it? I mean do we really want to same govt that runs the USPS to run healthcare? I dont want a bunch of fat politicians bleeding us dry in yet another way. "
"Congress doesnt represent the American people, hence the 11% approval rate. ... and Im not even going to waste my time talking about Obama upholding his position as our leader."
And since when did the extremists in Congress care about the will of the people? Is it the will of the people that government be closed ...sometimes I think at least this part is for the best...:-(
"Instead of the argument being ACA vs Single Payer, we have to constantly hear the false argument ACA vs Govt. shutdown."
"Like water, seeking the easiest path downhill, some of the effects of the ACA will be felt indirectly. - I am hearing of frantic efforts by corporations to offshore jobs (heck, we all are), downsize employee populations, and remove the words full time from all job descriptions. Couple that with the individual mandate to provide insurance. - There are stories of doctors throwing in the towel - apparently, with Medicare-level reimbursements, the overhead associated with larger practices amounts to a negative cash flow. The NP role (and less-trained nurses too) may be the one offering the bulk of care in the future. - While the initial prices I am seeing for the marketplace look to be pretty affordable, I wonder what happens when those who formerly did not have insurance enroll. For an insured group to be successful they have to be healthy, or at least half-way healthy. If you have a uniformly unhealthy population the rates collected do not cover the costs, forcing the rates to increase to cover the costs. I think those rates as initially published will be changing, and I would bet even money that they wont all decrease in price."
"This has absolutely nothing to do with the will of the people. Youre very naive to think that anything thats done in Washington is done with the peoples will in mind. You havent been paying very close attention to recent events. The same government that allowed the NSA to get away with what theyve done and continue doing it, quite apparently does not care about the will of the people."
"Congress always acts according to the will of the people, right? I hadnt been on /r/politics in sometime to read the Obama circle jerk that it is. Time to leave again."
"No no no, see, the will of the people only matters when it doesnt go against the will of the people who own this country."
The sole purpose of the tea bagger party is to oppose any and everything the president wants.. Whether they agree or not.. Even if its beneficial to 99 percent of the country. 
"Obamacare is offering huge perks to those states who agree to cover their poor, and these are the 15 states who will not be expanding their Medicare programs to cover those under the poverty line as a protest against Obamacare: Alabama Alaska Georgia Idaho Kansas Louisiana Maine Mississippi Montana Nebraska North Carolina South Carolina Texas Wisconsin Wyoming And these are the states that say they will probably join them very soon: Florida Missouri New Hampshire South Dakota Tennessee Utah Virginia So if you?re poor in these states, the reason you?re going to have to go without health care is because your state?s politicians find it more important to protest at your expense than get on board with a policy they don?t personally support. Aside from this being super grown-up of them, they won?t feel your pain unless you speak up. And you should."
"It is not the will of the people being usurped, it is the will of the special interest lobbyists who see Obamacare as a hand in their cookie jar...and they dont give a fuck about you or me. I for one, wanted universal health care."

"Representative government and will of the people, ah, thats funny."
Perhaps we should tell Mr. Cruz what we think of him. I did. http://www.cruz.senate.gov/
"Yes, exactly. Because your electoral system gave a clear thumbs up to the guy that campaigned hard for exactly this. You lost. Move along and stop thwarting the will of the people."
"if its so horrible why dont repugs let it get implemented and then use it as a tool to remove all those that appose? you would think that would be an obvious strategy. the fact that it is not tells me even they know its valid reform. Obamacare doesnt go far enough IMO, there will need to be a round 2."
so...Democrats are responsible for the Republicans refusing to fund the Government? I guess you have to be a Bagger to understand that one.
"Some people dont trust the government to handle anything. Also, if you believe the cost they estimated then you are a fool. When they first passed medicare/medicaid the estimated costs were 40x lower than what the cost ended up being. "
Just out of curiosity; do Congress men and woman continue to get payroll checks during a government shutdown?
A lot of people voted Obama just to not vote for Romney.
"Well in regards to Obama being relected, that doesnt mean anything because of our voting system, which is a first past the post system, heres a video that explains it very well and whats so wrong with it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo"
"Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository in Nevada was approved by Congress too, but that didnt stop Harry Reid from defunding it. Whats the difference?"
"As a Canadian, I really dont understand why the average citizen would not want to have far less expensive, if not free, healthcare. We have it up here and I dont know anyone who would ever change the system to make it privatized. The very idea of for-profit medical care is insane to me."
"If the healthcare systems in other countries like Canada work well, why isnt we dont just copy those systems exactly for our use?"
Even the unions dont like it. It exempts federal workers. It doesnt nothing to tackle the real issue. The ridiculous cost of healthcare... there was no reform in the bill in the least.

He was elected in the primary over Clinton by being the one against the mandate (/penalty for not signing up). He also said he wouldnt allow anymore backroom deals and would have the law available ten days before so everyone could vote for it. THAT was the guy the people voted for. This historical revisionism is actually getting kind of scary.
I like the free preventive services. This will benifit you and the taxpayer as the cheapest way to provide health care is to be proactive. There are plenty of examples of this throughout Europe where they get a much better bang for there buck.
Can anyone here give just one example of anything run by this Government that has actually been run well?
"And polling indicates that the American public supports Obamacare at just over a majority, and the Affordable Care Act at like 72% (go figure). So......."
Nice try Obama 
[deleted]
"Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck are people. Apparently, thanks to Tea Party politics, we have sunk so low that we all must suffer whenever the characters those two buffoons play in the media are upset. They get upset a lot."
"Well, the public option was promised, and had majority support, but instead we got a republican-created bill which mandates buying private healthcare, which was their idea in the first place and now theyre pretending it wasnt. So, the lack of a public option and inclusion of the mandate were how the will of the people was disregarded. However, the people who are currently campaigning against Obamacare are the ones who are to blame for that."
"As someone whose job is going to be directly impacted by the government shutdown.... Fuck you, you crazy right-wing idiots. Quit pulling this shit. This aint a game. Peoples lives are being impacted every time you throw one of your temper tantrums. Your party is not responsible enough to sit at the table with the big boys. Spoiled rotten children the lot of you. "
"To play some devils advocate here, Obama being reelected was not because of Obamacare alone. Democracy will work in due time. If the people who elected the current Congress disapprove of the way they are handling this situation, theyll have the opportunity to elect someone else in the next election. Perhaps the law should be changed so such delay would not be permitted? However I feel both Dems and Repubs use any advantages available to them for political posturing. Politics has turned into a game for those in it, not a way to represent the people. Were witnessing the game being played. Too bad our lives hang in the crosshairs."
hes black
"Im having a hard time seeing how the Republicans will gain any ground with this stunt. Who are they appealing to? Are they just so committed to this insanity that they cant turn around now? Really, how is the going to end? Are we going to default on our debt for 15 minutes before a compromise is reached?"
Did the house pass it?
"I personally *hate* ACA, I think that it is economically a very bad move, that the program will be mismanaged, and that the net benefit will be less then the net cost. That being said this article is correct. The People of the United States have voted in the majority to indicate that they liked the bill and wanted it to be law. Since it is a democracy..."
"Most of the Republicans ran on a platform to remove the ACA. They are doing what they promised to do. If every politician put forward as much effort to fulfilling their promises, the world would be a better place."
"The country is divided. As long as conservative voters keep nominating tea party candidates , the divide will just get deeper. "
Because of this bill I have lost my job twice (once at a hospital and another at an insurance agency) and now that I work for myself I will see the brunt of this bill. $539 a month to insure a family of 4 will be closer to $1200 next year.
The problem with posting this on Reddit is that I doubt there are more than 2 redditors in the world who would admit being tea party republicans 
"Congress passed Obamacare: Because we all know that Congress acts in the peoples interest 100% of the time, thats why it has such an astronomical approval rating. The President signed it: The American people elected the President on the promise of Health care reform, making healthcare cheaper and more accessible. Once the President is elected, its not like we have a say in the legislation he drafts, he does what he wants and congress votes on it. The Supreme Court upheld it: The Supreme Court also does not always act in the interest of the American people. Seperate but equal ring a bell? Just because the Supreme Court upheld it, it does not mean the will of the people was taken into consideration. Obama re-election: Slim margin of victory when all things were considered. Near 50/50 split. Plus, there is such a thing as a tyranny of the majority. Also, I think the massive protests of this healthcare law, as well as plenty of people taking to social media is indicative that the people are clearly upset by this law."
"Im going to be honest. I dont even know what Obamacare is. It has been a buzz word. Ive heard it is universal healthcare or something to that effect, but I have absolutely no idea how to get it, sign up for it, buy it, or whatever is were supposed to do with it. As far as the talk about cutting food stamps. I know that a lot of people need them. I also know that a lot of people use them as a crutch and that when faced with going hungry or finding a meal, they will figure out a way to eat. Crisis leads to ingenuity. We are never more creative than when faced with adversity. It is going to suck, but in the long run, it may be a good thing."
Obamacare was passed without 1 republican vote! Who the fuck didnt see this coming? This is what happens when one side is completely left out.
"The government has a history of making bad decisions against the will of the people. Vietnam, patriot act, gay marriage, etc. Even if I agree with the affordable care act, I dont have the pulse of the nation and Im not certain the majority wants obamacare. Representative democracy isnt perfect."
"Maybe somebody here can help me out. My brother makes a little less than 40,000 a year and has a son. My brother gets insurance through his work which is paid for, but adding on his son is 300 dollars. Is he stuck either paying the $300 a month, or paying the penalty for not having health care coverage? (keep in mind, I think he should get health care on his kid no matter what...maybe instead of paying for the car note he can barely afford)"
"Playing devils advocate here: If you are a representative from TN or SC, it is very likely that the people you represent WERE disregarded. A representative is not meant to think **for** their district or state but rather to voice the will of their state. If you are from a place like the former confederacy, where you might see your state as sovereign, you might feel that your will has been disregarded. They arent your average redditors, but they may still exist. Personally, I had been hoping for socialized medicine so I wouldnt have to travel to Costa Rica to get a medical procedure done."
"Ill just throw this little bit in. The healthcare mandate in the Senate was 60 for 39 against. The message was The people have spoken. The April vote for gun control was 60 against, 40 for. The message was we will try again until this is right. The will of the people is thrown around quite a bit. It all depends on whos speaking. "
"The Republicans are the ONLY ones that are altering their positions and compromising. They originally wanted to defund Obamacare. Now they simply want to delay ObamaCare for one year for further studies. And lets not forget that this administration has already issued numerous delays for various parts of ObamaCare AND issued numerous amounts of ObamaCare waivers. Why arent the Democrats willing to further delay implementation for another year to analyze this giant 10,000+ page bundle of regulations?"
obama care is a shit compromise as far as Im concerned. Nothing short of universal will do. 
You have to walk a thin line looking out for your voters to get the votes while also holding out for favors to pass your personal pork barrel bills while also bleeding companies for the highest campaign contributions for passing bills for them that later you will stick your hands into and line your pockets. 
"The will of a tiny minority was subverted because thats how democracy works. That tiny minority has now decided to practice political terrorism. They are convinced that because they didnt get their way, and all their friends agree with them, that democracy was subverted. They have found some technicalities that they can abuse to magnify their influence. The whole thing is fairly tragic. I dont imagine this will become less common. More political minorities will start using these tactics to hold bills up and force new negotiations on settled issues again and again. Welcome to a new level of dysfunctional governance. "
"Republicans really need to defend themselves here. It seems plausible that Republicans are willing to ruin this entire country at this very moment because they dont like Obamacare. Im in my late twenties and what Im saying is that they (may be) willing to basically ruin (at least) the next 5 years if not more of MY life because they dont like Obamacare. You dont like Obamacare? Win the next election. Win the next presidency. Get all three chambers like you had with Bush. But until then, your job is to govern. What that means is that your job is to get stuff done for the American people. Its not perfect and for the next year it may be a bit distasteful, but youre job is to serve your constituents the BEST you can to get stuff done and to keep our way of life, both in terms of physical safety or economic safety, intact. The only thing that Republicans have nowadays is rhetoric. They have no substance. Its all principle this, principle that. Life is much messier than that. This is what happens when you elect people who arent in tune with the real world. Other countries get along. Look at Germany or the Northern European countries."
As an Australian THANKYOU Medicare and PBS!
"Im 20, have a severe mental illness, both parents dead and I cant get insurance for shit, because of health care act, I can get insurence, thanks Obama."
"This article has to be one of the most upfront and sobering articles Ive read about whats going on right now. You can feel the journalists giving up as you read it, and its really sad."
**COOOONNNSSSSPIIIIIORRRAAAACCCCYYYYUY!!!!**
"If the president wanted it, and if congress approved it, the people re-elected him then we need to grow up and accept that its what we need to do. Oh sorry, I was referring to the Iraq war - what was the question?"
"When republicans say they represent the people, they mean it. And by people they mean those who pay us the most. Really, thats the end of the discussion. There really isnt anything to add."
"Moderate Republicans are starting to revolt because they see the Tea Party dragging them down alongside them. Boehner on the other hand is still concerned about his job rather than the party as a whole. He will be royally screwed if he cant muster up the votes to pass his Plan C, he will then have to need Democratic support to get anything done. Then he will lose his job, the question is what is more important to him. His job or his party. If you want a real House of Cards imagine if Ted Cruz approached Cantor, who wants the Speakership, with a plan to oust Boehner while allowing Cruz and his colleagues to continue their purity tests and purges."
"Ill point it out to you. &gt; **Congress** passed Obamacare, the **president** signed it, the **Supreme Court** upheld it, **Obama** campaigned on it a second time and was reelected. So in what manner was the will of the people disregarded? The president campaigned on his just-as-shitty opponents big mouth. Less than half of the entire U.S. population voted in the 2012 election so to say that 21% of the U.S. represents the majority would be asinine. **Bold** represents government, not the people. How the fuck did this post get 3000+ upvotes? Thats right, Im in ~~/r/collegeliberal~~ /r/politics."
The title says it all. 
It passed because nobody read it at first...
"I cant get past the fact that Obama lied to the people in order to get the bill passed. You can keep your doctor, keep your health care plan, your premiums will go down $2,700 per family. None of that was true, and because people voted on false information their votes were stolen and democracy denied. In my opinion, no matter how many good things may lie within it, the ACA does not have legitimacy. Its no wonder to me at all that people feel it is legitimate to use any tactic whatsoever to repeal, delay or subvert it any way they can."
"Yeah, a law gets passed that republicans dont like so they quit doing their jobs and put the country at risk? WTF? Fire em all."
"Since they didnt bother to get any Republican support for ACA. If the argument trying to be made is that the Democrats followed the letter of the law in passing ACA, then the same exact argument applies to what the Republicans are trying to do now. The Democrats rolled the dice in jamming ACA through and now they are having to deal with the consequences."
Obamacare in particular to me always seemed like a case of the: I didnt propose this idea so i must oppose it
wow thats a tremendous oversimplification. 
"Some citizens obviously count more than others, like the Tea Party elite. Clearly they are a better class of humans deserving to have their way based on their angry conspiracies and fever-based facts. They are much closer to God and know his will, whereas the rest of us merely use reasoning and common sense. Could that be it?"
the SCOTUS has only ruled on one challenge to the law so far. They havent even taken up the numerous other challenges on other grounds. Just because they found one provision to be constitutional does not mean they wont find others to be unconstitutional. Just sayin.
Well. Hows your insurance? Is it lower than before they got into office? Is it affordable. I remember those words AFFORDABLE HEALTH care. Where is that? What the people want.
Would have anything to do with Obama lying about how much it will cost ND who it will or wont cover?

Government shut down???? What a fucken joke this country has become WE are better than this Maybe we arent WE THE PEOPLE!
"The people did not vote obamacare through. Taking a look at this: http://www.scribd.com/doc/171715723/TMC-September-2013-Tracking-Poll-Toplines Do you think that the people would have approved it, given a nationwide vote?"
"Because SCOTUS relied on what can only be called tortuous logic to uphold it, and a majority of Americans DONT WANT IT TO BE THE LAW."
"&gt; Congress passed Obamacare The Democratic controlled Congress passed Obamacare along party lines and used every parliamentary trick in the book to get it done. Remember You have to pass it before you will find out whats in it? Remember the backroom deals made to Blue Dog Democrats? Offering their states money, exemptions anything to get their vote? &gt; The Supreme Court upheld it The Supreme Court only upheld it when considered a tax. This would mean that Obamacare is one of the largest tax increases on the middle class in the nations history. Remember Obama claimed that it wasnt a tax? Remember when the Obamalawyers argues in court that it was a tax? &gt;Obama campaigned on it a second time No he didnt. He hardly ever mentioned it on the campaign trail. Only the most liberal Dems in the most liberal areas even whisper it under their breath. "
"For those following the vote, the two things they are arguing about is delaying the individual mandate for one year (denying IRS funding to enforce it) and removing the exemption for medical equipment. As far as I can tell, all the other riders have been removed. Considering this only lasts for 45 days, is it worth the Democrats delaying it for those two reasons?"
"So, about 600 people, of 314 million citizens, is considered the will of the people... Ya I stopped reading after that. "
The poll also found a majority of Americans - 54 percent - disapprove of the health care law Citation: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505267_162-57595225/cbs-news-poll-finds-more-americans-than-ever-want-obamacare-repealed/
Congress represents the completely accurate will of the people? Learned something new.

"If Obamacare is as big a failure as the Republicans say it is, than why not let is pass so they can say I told you so? Instead they want to shutdown the government which is arguably much more destructive than what they claim is wrong with Obamacare. They can always just make it go away at a later date because the will of the people will demand it. Lets get real. Something smells mighty fucking fishy here. I am thinking they are afraid Obamacare, might just work. This is their nightmare. That all the lies and bullshit they make up about Obama on a daily basis will vanish in a poof of smoke. Well you know what... Poof motherfuckers. POOF!"
"No matter what Obama does, people will be pissed. Sadly, its because hes black."
People like me are fucked. I either go on medicare or incur a $130 cost that I cant afford. 
"Quick question because I dont have a real understanding of Obamacare. I heard somewhere that people who dont get insurance will be fined/have their tax returns held by the IRS. I live in a crazy conservative state, so I dont know if this is a lie of not. That being said, assuming it is true, what about those people who already *cant* afford insurance? If theyre forced to buy insurance, but cannot due so because of their current incomes, will the just be penalized more for being poor? Thanks to anyone who answers."
"I dont have a problem affording health insurance. I am healthy and take care of myself. But I have a problem with getting taxed to pay for health care for the less fortunate. I work hard and to have the government take my money and give it to someone else, pisses me off. I understand that some people are denied by insurance and others with insurance still cant afford their meds, but if I wanted to pay for your health care, I would have mailed a check (assuming that I cared if you lived or died). There are many ways to begin addressing the ridiculous health care system in America, taxing the shit out of people is not a good place to start. And... the down votes pour in because I believe differently than you. :-( EDIT; now I get to pay for abortions too? Wonderful. http://drudgegae.iavian.net/r?hop=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtontimes.com%2Fnews%2F2013%2Fsep%2F30%2Fwhite-house-lawmakers-staff-get-abortion-coverage"
"The GOP wants to shut down the government and when they do and the stock market falters, they will buy up everything at discounted values. All of this posturing is just a ruse for hiding their real goals...follow the money."
Some of us are mad that none of those people read the fucking thing before passing/signing/upholding it. 
"As a lawyer who counsels businesses on a variety of issues, the ACA is a nightmarish piece of ineffective and poorly drafted legislation that should be burned and replaced with a simpler, single payer system. As an American, Im sickened by the behavior of these lifelong legislators who come from repeatedly gerrymandered districts."
Dont assume my will was.
"Can I step outside the box here and ask this... Why is a healthcare reform an answer to solving an economic crisis in the first place. Now, its on the table, its relevant, so its whats best. But are there not so many more ways to deal with a crisis than something that is so controversial. I suppose anything will be. But its basic finance. If you dont have any money and youre in debt, dont keep borrowing more and keep putting yourself further in the hole."
Even as a person who is opposed to the ACA I find this to be absolutely ridiculous. If the Republican party wants to do away with the ACA then maybe they should win some fucking elections. 
&gt;So in what manner was the will of the people disregarded? The GOP is talking about the will of the 1% that got them elected.
I would prefer universal healthcare and hope all this silly bs is just the road to it.
"Id be more respectful of congress if they cut their own healthcare out. http://ribble.house.gov/press-release/ribble-introduces-legislation-banning-members-congress-receiving-health-care-benefits &gt;Washington, D.C. - Congressman Reid Ribble introduced the No Health Care for Life for Congress Act of 2013 (H.R. 2894). Should the Affordable Care Act be repealed, this legislation would prevent all members of Congress from receiving taxpayer funded health care benefits when they retire from Congress. &gt;For decades, Americans have given Congress consistently failing grades while Congress has been playing by its own rules. Congress needs to stop giving themselves perks and sweetheart benefits that are not available to American citizens and play by the same rules that hardworking American families do. The founding fathers wanted members of Congress to be citizen legislators, not career politicians. "
"I dont understand how some of the Republicans dont remember high school civics lessons. If, somehow miraculously gets to the Presidents desk, hell veto the bill. Then 2/3 of the senate will be needed to override it. In no scenario are they going to come out on top. Theyll just bury everyone else. "
"amen brother. You left out - it was a major part of his platform when he ran for election in the first place. Seriously wish Obama would lose his cool at this point, march down to the house and school these idiots. Let the ACA run - if it fails then the repubs can roll it back by legislative process if and when they get a majority in the senate or get the executive back. - not by this bullshit."
"I work for a Tea Party Congressman and at the risk of being thrown in the lake of fire/angry-internet-comments, Id just like to present the point of view that I spew each day at the office to angry democratic citizens. So, to give the fox news explanation of things, not a single Republican Congressman voted for this bill. While that may not seem significant to some, it is significant given the back ground of the constitution as a document inspired by Madisons Virginia plan. The Congress was designed by Madison to be hopelessly inefficient. Why? In case (for example) a majority of crazy-right-wing-conservatives were somehow voted in with the mind set that they would remove all taxes and all welfare programs in one fell swoop of legislation, despite how loudly the left clamored for their blood over these changes, these changes would be hindered by discussion, compromise and the effort it takes to get anything done in Congress. Madison wanted to prevent the majority faction from overwhelming the concerns of the minority in the blind quest of a single goal. What happened with the ACA was, to many in the Republican party, an example of this. If I remember correctly, Nancy Pelosi did not allow debate on the house floor, and then called for a vote without any significant compromise. The Republicans felt as if their concerns have not been heard in this matter. Next, you must understand that while Obama was elected in a nation-wide election, the House and the Senate have a more narrow constituency. My Congressman ran on the promise that he would repeal Obama Care shortly after the law was passed when the minority Republicans were feeling particularly insignificant. The people in our district expect our elected official to act this way, if he didnt hed probably be voted out because he would, in the truest sense, be ignoring the peoples will. That being said... This fight is entirely symbolic. We know it, the Republicans know it. The only ones who dont know are the people who are voting for the tea party. Ive found this a little disingenuous on the part of the Republican party. Many of the people who call in support of Obama Care to be de-funded seem to think this is an actual possibility. Its not, but Fox News says it is and so they think it is. Its kind of sad to listen to sometimes... "
"Obama Care I just heard the most interesting idea. The House needs to pass a bill that negates all exclusions, changes, revisions, whatever else has been changed. Congress and big business and the unions have to abide by the law as it was written, passed and signed. Then a sundown clause has to be added. Meaning if this thing is as bad as most Americans think or if its as good as the Democrats believe it will have to be voted on again in 2 years. The Senate will have to vote on this law. Lets see their true colors."
Cant see why people think this a controversial issue. The law says that instead of say Fuck these people. Screw it lets see what happens. you are saying to them Now you dont have a choice on whether or not to get fuck in the ass by a corporation.

"Ya know, back in the 1990s I was appalled when the GOP prosecuted the President over The (cum)Shot Heard Round The World. I really thought they couldnt go any lower than that. Then came the 00s. GOP lies got us into a war that caused the deaths of over a million people (Iraq) and the displacement of God knows how many more. They used the excuse of protecting us from terrorism to drive home the security state that they worked hard to establish through the War on Drugs in the 1980s. Basically they eviscerated the Bill of Rights, and when liberals like myself complained we were called un-American. Just like in the 80s we were disparaged for defending what we held the Constitution to be, all because of their stupidity, or maybe because of their unwillingness to really examine their beliefs and what path those beliefs lead us to. Now we have this. In order to further an ideology, a political agenda, these cocksuckers are more than happy to destroy the economy of the US. They complain about welfare and strip SNAP out of the Farm bill, all while increasing the amount of money that bill puts out to multi-billion dollar industrial agriculture. All in all, I have to say, the GOP is truly a home for disgusting human beings. Its a damned shame they have any say at all in the affairs of our nation. May they rot in a hell that I dont believe in, but that they seem to believe in whole-heartedly. What pigs."
"I just read an article that was discussing what would happen if a person doesnt pay the penalty for not having insurance. According to the article, there are clauses in the ACA that say basically the IRS will have no real power for collecting the penalty. Now, if you had a refund due, they would subtract the difference of the penalty you owe from your refund, but the IRS will not be allowed to garnish wages, seize property and even pursue any sort of criminal action against you if you dont pay the penalty. article --&gt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/13/readers-ask-we-answer-what-happens-if-you-dont-pay-obamacares-tax-penalty/"
"most people i know dont know enough about obamacare to care one way or the other. we just dont like him. and so if he is for it, were against it. "
"What really nips at my nipples is hearing Republicans say that Obamacare is not working, its time to reverse it while the law is not even active yet. Fundamentally, opponents of the ACA are afraid that it will not only work but that this law will go down in history as a major step forward in the history of the US. Cant wait to watch the back pedaling and flip flopping well be seeing then. And when this starts happening, a lot of the opponents will see their political careers and presidential aspirations vanish in a puff of smoke. By 2015, anyone whos still opposing the Affordable Care Act will have no future on the US political scene. "
How is mandating that you maintain health insurance a good thing? All it is doing is guaranteeing that health insurance companies are going to make more money and screw more people over. Good going and NOT the will of all the people.
Were saying the same things over again- Flobots
They have found a new way to enforce cuts in the social programs they hate so much. Even tepid reforms such as Obamacare.
There are people who seriously need elements of this such as the pre-existing conditions clause and the no-lifetime limits. The republicans are fucking with people.
"I was all for it, but the details of the law are just wrong. I got my letter from the insurance company today, I was paying $75 a month for basic health coverage before, and now I will be paying $280 a month. Apparently Im not allowed to benefit from being a healthy young person anymore, and must pay the same as the elderly fat smokers. All I need is basic catastrophe prevention coverage, I take no medicine, have no conditions, and just need something that kicks in if I end up in an ambulance, it is ridiculous that my monthly bill will increase by a factor of 4. I am considering going without insurance and eating the penalty, the affordable health care act has done the exact opposite for me and made it unaffordable. I knew wed all have to do our part and pay a little more for coverage, but I was expecting something like $125 a month instead of 75, not friggin $280 a month. I appreciate that healthcare laws need to change, but this is the wrong change and if Im forced to pay it, Im gonna change my votes over to the red team."
"The same way any unpopular law is the result of the will of the People having been disregarded: The congress elected in 2008 ran, at best, on a platform of health care reform, not the actual Affordable Care Act (a.k.a., Obamacare) itself; the President is not elected by the People directly but by Electors (note: I think this is a good thing but thats a different discussion); the Supreme Court has no role in determining what is the will of the People and only determined the Individual mandate could be interpreted as a use of the taxing power but not a use of the interstate commerce regulation power; Obama campaigned not solely on health reform but also on other issue positions as well the alleged inability of Mitt Romney to govern *as well* as Obama; and, again, the President is not elected by the People directly but by Electors (note: I **still** think this is a good thing but thats a different discussion). With all of these indirections and conditionals applying to any bill which becomes law, scarcely **any** legislation which makes it onto the books could truly be considered as reflecting the will of the People. Whether this result is a good thing or not is a matter of interpretation."
The people werent given a chance comprehend what was in it before it was passed; see Pelosi saying we had to pass it to find out what was in it. The Supreme Courts upheld the individual mandate as a tax after the people were told repeatedly that the bill had nothing to do with taxes. Obama predominantly ran for reelection on convincing people that Romney was cheating the public by only paying several million dollars per year in taxes.
What a silly question. This fundamentally flawed legislation was forced through by a fiercely partisan Democrat congress without a single Republican vote. The Supreme court reconstructed the law and declared a fee a tax and my insurance is going up by over 60% for my family. Once you understand that the will of the people and this government charade are two entirely different things you will be one step closer to being an adult.
Its times like these where I swear were living in some postmodern novel or some shit... Holding our government hostage for their own partisan squabbling. Shits gotten insane yall
Because its all rigged. Thats meant as both serious and sarcastic. 
Can someone explain to me what is going on about the government shutting down? I need some1 to dumb it down. I think its about congress not being able to make a bill to satisfy one another and they are running out of time for the deadline?
"...right, its good for all us little folk, but not good for the big guys and gals on capitol hill. Enjoy, serfs! "
"You misunderstood what the GOP means by Will of the people. Dont feel bad it is easy to do. My father is a rabid, raving republican. I am mildly fluent in batshit crazy. Allow me to help. When a republican says Will of the people what they really mean is The desires of the corporations that own me."
"The people elected a house of representatives. Do you have a problem with representative democracy? The house has followed the rules and expressed its will, passed a CR. This is the process. The representatives are within their rights representing the will of those who put them in office. Those of you who demand that they not represent their constituents but do as you would prefer them to do reveal yourselves as enemies of the democratic process. "
"Look personally I hate Obamacare, I think its an awful idea but it passed through our screwed up government that gets nothing done. D.C. actually got something done may as well try it out for a decade or so hell maybe ill end up liking it idk but i do know i will hate it when my father doesnt get his social security check and he has no way to live. 90% of the time im a diehard conservative but sometimes you just have to be human Really this is our leadership id rather have Obama be president for 8 more years instead of having the republicans throwing a fit everytime they dont get their way. Youre making me look bad!"
"It was not. The extreme right does not care about the peoples will, or democracy. They only care about the power they lost. When the old whites that comprise their party die, the country will be much better off (said as an old person!)"
See PATRIOT Act.
"This really has nothing to do with Obamacare. Tea Party candidates ran on the promise that they would shut down the government, and theyre making good on that promise. Any excuse will do."
"From an outsiders perspective, the biggest danger to America seems to be its information bubbles. Basically you have self contained sources of information that peddle a very specific message to a very specific group of people. Right now you have people who live in two different worlds, they only hear what specific groups want them to so they cant even look at this one issue because it isnt the same issue at all to them. If you want to fix your country you need to take care of this. When they came out last week and said there was a major victory for the Republicans they were only speaking to their own people - everyone else was thinking WTF?"
I dont even support Obama. But this fact made me angry. How the hell are House republicans saying the will of the American people to get rid of ObamaCare when the damn man won reelection. It wasnt even close. 
My toothache is keeping me up because of the pulsing pain running up the side of my head. I really hope this shit passes
They shouldnt have let the health insurance industry [write the bill](http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/03/29/baucus-thanks-wellpoint-vp-liz-fowler-for-writing-health-care-bill/). &gt;*So in what manner was the will of the people disregarded?*
"Boy, lots of astroturfers out today. Lots of fake bloggers making money."
Theres always free cheese in a mouse trap...
"Hey! Hannity, Savage, Levin, Coulter, Limbaugh, Fox News, have all told them, their will has been ignored, the alphabets back it up by repeating the lies as news. Rush says, bla bla. . . etc. They also think Romney won in 2012. "
"Thomas Frank wrote a book about this in 2008. Its called *The Wrecking Crew* and it really lays out how the Grand Old Party rigs government to not work so they can bring in private contractors at twice the price, and other BS. "
"Let?s stop making excuses for the GOP. The GOP is actively engaged in a criminal conspiracy to subvert American democracy, through the use of gerrymandering voter suppression and misinformation this is against both the spirit and the letter of the law. I want the GOP to be ousted for the extremist nut jobs that they are. At this point the GOP just seems like a spiteful child throwing a temper tantrum because they did not get there way. The GOP is a cancer on American democracy and must be stamped out."
"If fucking con filth morons hate America so much, why do they stay? How would they feel if a Dem congress shut down the government, refused to raise the debt limit unless abortion on demand, paid for by taxpayers became law? Or if they defunded the Iraq war? Or raised the minimum wage? God damn Republicans... rot in hell."
"My buddy with a bad back is finally going to be able to do something about it. I couldnt be happier for him, and Im very thankful for Obamacare. "
"Maybe if the congress had the chance to actually read the bill before they voted on it, and maybe make the full text of the bill available to the public for a reasonable amount of time to review, like Obama promised to do before signing any legislation back during his first presidential campaign?"
I have read the whole ACA in full. I am for it. People should not have to worry about paying ridiculous hospital fees or surcharges on medications. I think this is a good thing. 
"So for those of us that havent really been paying attention, whats the current state of obamacare? When do we get it and what do we get?"
"Graph of this posts karma, hot list position in [r/all](http://www.reddit.com/r/all), and comment count: [i.imgur.com/7zu6mgQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/7zu6mgQ.png) This image may update when more data is available. Please note that this data represents what was observed by this bot via the reddit api and is in no way official."
Citizens United is also law of the land. I suppose Dems would be willing to let that law stand?
When House Republicans wiped their ass with the legislative process and representative democracy and resorted to blackmail to achieve what they could could not accomplish though the polls or legislation. 
Other wills of the people... include the PATRIOT Act and the NSA. Id be fine disregarding those.
"I believe that the majority of our people dont want it. Im a single parent with 2 small kids and Im looking at thousands more per year, and Im very happy with my existing coverage."
It is a mistake to assume that the Presidents reelection indicates that a majority of the people support the most controversial provisions of the ACA. Health care was only one of many issues voters had to consider in the last election. There are plenty of ways to evaluate public support for the law without resorting to intellectual dishonesty. This sort of rhetoric from politicians undermines public trust.
"The PATRIOT Act only passed due to the mass hysteria after 9/11. If this same legislation had been introduced shortly before 9/11, it would have been shot down quicky."
"For what I see, Obamacare is crap. I dont even want health care right now. Im healthy and will pay out of pocket if something happens. Let that be my choice! Now on the other hand we did vote him in office, AGAIN, what did we expect? That the Affordable Healthcare Act was magically going to disappear?? I say let the miss-informed America have it on a Government issued gold plate funded by our fake money. "
"Congress passed immigration law. The president signed it, the courts have upheld it, the people who passed it were reelected. So why is the president illegally refusing to enforce it? He is mandated by the constitution to enforce the law. Its no different. Why one standard for him and another for everyone else? "
Its much easier to track when a republican tells the truth vs. lying. 
"Why can Republicans blatantly lie to the American people? Because, and I quote: fool me once, shame on ? shame on you. Fool me ? you cant get fooled again."
For some reason I read that as horse Republicans.
"Its not really a blatant lie, its a difference of economic opinion. [Heres](http://www.politifact.com/ohio/article/2011/dec/06/so-how-you-do-you-define-jobs-bill/) a good politifact article from a few years ago that breaks it down better. "
What is a jobs bill supposed to mean anyway?
Who knew? National economic sabotage/obstruction and anti-abortion legislation is a job creation effort. Republican legislators must be referring to their gerrymandered jobs alone.
"This website is dog shit. They consistently put click bait, such as this article, to generate ad revenue. They link to Boehners speaker.gov page and say here are some of the things Republicans call job bills. Politicususa doesnt say why they arent jobs, it just states as fact that they are not. Top notch journalism! One of the bills was for the pipeline Republicans have been trying to pass for a while. Like the pipeline or not, but its hard to argue that building a HUGE pipeline into the US would not create jobs. "
"In other news, water is wet."
"They said jobs bills, not job creation bills. Job destruction bills are job bills too. Se technically they are right."
its only a matter of time before they rant incoherently in congress and claim that theyre speaking in tongues and have received divine enlightenment
House Republicans blatantly lie **FTFY**
And each one of them had to repeal Obamacare to get passed. No thanks.
A bill will not create jobs it is something you have to pay?
"Headline is a blatant lie, not the the claim of Republicans. The author gives a list of legislation and simply decides on his own that no jobs would come from any of them. By the same logic, well just arbitrarily decide that all Democrat bills will help no one and that all of the claims about wantint to help poor people are just Democrat lies. More /r/politics idiocy."
Theyre probably counting all those Defund Obamacare votes as being jobs bills. Shameless assholes.
What? They helped Chinese citizens get millions of jobs.

"Stopped reading as soon as I saw the subheading for that website... Real Liberal Politics. This is only slightly less laughable than fair and balanced because they at least arent pretending to be fair. The story very well may be based in fact but as an independent, how anyone can treat any news site as the gospel amazes me. The site blatantly has a Liberal swing yet over 1,100 have upvoted this. Does anyone honestly trust ANYONE in the House on either side? It amazes me how people run these articles up the flagpole and everyone jumps in bashing one side or the other. Heres a news flash... Theyre all lying asshats. Think for yourselves people. Dont let some blog masquerading as a news site feed you your facts. "
Thank god credible media outlets like politicususa are spreading the truth in a sea of lies. It is ridiculous how the mainstream media lets the Republicanists get away with these lies. 
"Lets assume that absolutely no jobs would be created from any of those bills what so ever. So can I ask the question of where are the jobs bills from the left, especially the Senate? Has anyone seen that laser like focus that we were told or is that another politically expedient lie?"
"Another democrat myth busted that republicans are the bill blockers. Reid is sitting on jobs bills that would create one million jobs http://naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=366264 Reid blocks vote on jobs bill while Obama blasts House for not voting on it http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/reid-blocks-vote-jobs-bill-while-obama-blasts-193308476.html 15 jobs bills blocked by Reid http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/jborowski/15-real-jobs-bills-stalled-in-the-senate Oh and Obamacare is a job killer. It increased my medical costs by $1,000 this year. Thats a lot of money that could have gone back into the economy to help create jobs elsewhere instead its paying bills that would have been only 350 for the year instead of 1,000"
Not sure about dozens but they have sent several jobs bills to Dirty Harry. He then squashed them all without allowing votes. Reid is the biggest obstructionist in recent American history.
"Unfortunately, most of their jobs bills were geared to cut public employee jobs."
I hard a hard time believing that the House passed jobs bills simply because I cant recall our government simply passing ANY bills at all
"There are other ways of creating jobs than jacking up spending so the government can hire people or give more unearned benefits. For instance, anytime you reduce the tax burden on Americans, or reduce regulatory compliance costs for businesses, you are helping to create jobs. Lowering taxes gives people more disposable income, and lower regulatory compliance costs allow businesses to reinvest more of their profits and grow faster. More small businesses could become medium-sized businesses if they had lower compliance costs. So considering a lot of Republican bills do this, it is just as much of a lie to say that Republicans do nothing to create jobs. It is dangerous to think that the Democrats have a monopoly on job creation."
the only thing theyve passed is wind and their ~~sell~~buy-by-dates
"Dozens-of-jobs bills. see, no lies"
"Last time they claimed theyd sent 30 jobs bills to the senate and insidious Harry Reid wouldnt pass them. Except it wasnt 30 and the CBO looked at them and said none of them would create jobs. Theres a total of six committees investigating Benghazi though, so we have that going for us."

"Its not a lie. Every time they pass their corruption, graft and pork in bills they are creating some jobs. Every time they do it, more crony capitalists find themselves securely in business."
Republicans lying??? [Im SHOCKED!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMIyDf3gBoY)
"Often (mis) quoted, but definitely a case where its true: Make the lie big. Keep it simple. Repeat it over and over, and eventually they will believe you."
"Its very easy to look up the bills they passed that would create jobs. Liberals just dont want to face the truth. Especially here in Reddits groupthink central... 1) H.R. 872?Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act: The bill would amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to clarify that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a state may not require a permit under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for the application of pesticides regulated under FIFRA. By removing duplicative requirements, the bill would reduce overlapping and unnecessary regulation on pesticides that are already regulated, thereby reducing costs to both farmers and small business owners. 2) H.R. 910?Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011: H.R. 910 would prohibit the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases to address climate change under the Clean Air Act. More specifically, the bill would prohibit the EPA from regulating: water vapor; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; and any other substance subject to regulation, action or consideration under the Clean Air Act to address climate change. The bill would prevent a needless increase in energy prices for American households and businesses. 3) H.J.Res. 37?Disapproving the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission with respect to regulating the Internet and broadband industry practices: The bill would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from implementing a net-neutrality rule which would prohibit Internet providers from slowing or blocking legal websites or Internet services because of concerns over bandwidth. In May 2010, seventy-four House Democrats sent a letter to FCC Chairman Genachowski making the case that net-neutrality rules will ?jeopardize jobs? and ?should not be done without additional direction from Congress.? 4) H.R. 1230?Restarting American Offshore Leasing Now Act: H.R. 1230 would require the Department of the Interior (DOI) to auction offshore oil and gas leases in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico, as well as in an area off the coast of Virginia. The bill would help to reduce energy prices and promote job creation by expediting offshore oil and natural gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and the Virginia coast. 5) H.R. 1229?Putting the Gulf of Mexico Back to Work Act: H.R. 1229 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to require that any lessee operating under an approved exploration plan obtain a permit before drilling any well, and obtain a new permit before drilling any well of a design that is significantly different than the design for which an existing permit was issued. The bill would prohibit the Secretary from issuing a permit without ensuring that the proposed drilling operations meet all critical safety system requirements (including blowout prevention), and oil spill response and containment requirements. 6) H.R. 1231?Reversing President Obamas Offshore Moratorium Act: H.R. 1231 would require that each five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program offer leasing in the areas with the most prospective oil and gas resources, and would establish a domestic oil and natural gas production goal. The bill would essentially lift the Presidents ban on new offshore drilling by requiring the Administration to move forward on American energy production in areas estimated to contain the most oil and natural gas resources. 7) H.R. 2021?The Jobs and Energy Permitting Act of 2011: H.R. 2021 would eliminate needless permitting delays that have stalled important energy production opportunities off the coast of Alaska. The bill would also eliminate the permitting back-and-forth that occurs between the EPA and its Environmental Appeals Board. Rather than having exploration air permits repeatedly approved and rescinded by the agency and its review board, the EPA will be required to take final action ? granting or denying a permit?within six months. 8) H.R. 2018?Clean Water Cooperative Federalism Act of 2011: H.R. 2018 would a restrict the EPA ability to issue a revised or new water quality standard for a pollutant whenever a state has adopted and EPA already has approved a water quality standard for that pollutant, unless the state concurs with the EPA Administrator?s determination that the revised or new standard is necessary to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act. The bill would prevent unilateral actions by the EPA that second-guess the decisions of the state regulatory agency. 9) H.R. 1315?Consumer Financial Protection &amp; Soundness Improvement Act: H.R. 1315 would improve consumer protection and provides greater economic stability by allowing the Financial Stability Oversight Council to vote to set aside any harmful federal regulation. 10) H.R. 1938? North American-Made Energy Security Act: H.R. 1938 would direct the President, acting through the Secretary of Energy, to coordinate with all federal agencies responsible for an aspect of the Presidents National Interest Determination and Presidential Permit decision regarding construction and operation of Keystone XL, to ensure that all necessary actions are taken on an expedited schedule. The bill would promote job creation and energy security by ending the needless delay of the construction and operation of the Keystone XL pipeline. 11) H.R. 2587?Protecting Jobs From Government Interference Act: H.R. 2587 would prohibit the National Labor Relations Board (NRLB) from ordering any employer to close, relocate, or transfer employment under any circumstance. 12) H.R. 2401?Transparency In Regulatory Analysis Of Impacts On The Nation: H.R. 2401 would require analyses of the cumulative and incremental impacts of certain rules and actions of the Environmental EPA. Specifically, the bill would require the President to establish the Committee for the Cumulative Analysis of Regulations that Impact Energy and Manufacturing. The Committee would be charged with analyzing and reporting on the cumulative and incremental impacts of covered rules and actions of the EPA concerning air, waste, water, and climate change. The bill would establish the interagency committee to evaluate the economic impacts of EPA regulations and delay the final dates for both the maximum achievable control technology (Utility MACT) standards and the cross-state air pollution rule (CSAPR) until the full impact has been studied. Both regulations would cost consumers and businesses $184 billion from 2011-2030 and would cause electrical prices to skyrocket. 13) H.R. 2681?Cement Sector Regulatory Relief Act: H.R. 2681 would provide a legislative stay of three EPA emissions standards that apply to cement manufacturing plants and are known as the ?Cement MACT rules.? The bill would also provide for the implementation of effective regulation that protects communities both environmentally and economically. 14) H.R. 2250?EPA Regulatory Relief Act: H.R. 2250 would provide a legislative stay of four interrelated EPA rules, commonly referred to as the ?Boiler MACT rules,? that govern emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from approximately 200,000 boilers and incinerators nationwide. The bill would remove this excessive regulatory burden placed on employers by the EPA?s Boiler MACT rules, potentially costing companies $14 billion and 224,000 American jobs, and replace them with sensible, achievable rules that do not destroy jobs. 15) H.R. 2273?Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act: H.R. 2273 would utilize the framework and requirements of an existing federal regulatory program developed by the EPA under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (RCRA) as the basis for enforceable minimum federal standards for the regulation of a waste stream known as coal ash. The bill would include enforceable federal standards, but would leave regulation and enforcement to the states. The bill would also provide consistent, safe management of coal combustion residuals in a way that protects jobs and encourages recycling and beneficial use. "
Wait...Didnt Republicans just SHUT DOWN the whole freaking country (putting millions of Americans out of work for weeks) just a few months ago? Im pretty sure they did.
"Clinton 2016: because blow jobs, are better than no jobs."
Lies? Hmmm... If you like your doctor...
"They have. Ask any of them if theyd like to support a jobs bill and youll surely get the answer of Nah, I think Ill pass."
"Republicans lie, Democrats lie, Independents lie, House Reps lie, Senators lie, Presidents lie, justices lie, they all lie. No reason to point at one when the whole lot are rotten to the core. "
Oh come on. Ive stopped thinking in terms of Rethuglican and Demorat. They are politicians! Of course they lie. Like rugs and big dogs. Its in the job description. 
As opposed to Obama who has refused to look at improving jobs in the US. 
There was 60% public support for single payer at the beginning of the talks.
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/01/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-majority-favor-single-payer-h/ Depends on the poll and how its worded apparently. And support is slowly falling.
"[The number of people receiving food stamps continues at near-record levels.] (http://www.factcheck.org/2013/10/obamas-numbers-october-update/) However, we shouldnt be surprised at such increases. Ever since the collapse of the finance sector during the Bush presidency and the resulting Great Recession, more people have been forced into poverty. There are more long-term unemployed than weve seen since the Great Depression of the late 1920s and 1930s. Furthermore, the tidal wave of money moving from the poor and middle classes to those who already are (by comparison) fabulously wealthy continues. As more and more people are forced into poverty, they require more and more public assistance."
Ha. Funny. Read the post and read the comments. Im far from being part of the tea party.
"I believe it has, but thats because of a little thing called **THE F*CKING RECESSION**, which, ya know, left people needing help."
"&gt;people consider Obamacare welfare How could anyone possibly consider that welfare? People are not being *given* insurance; theyre *buying* insurance. Yes, some people receive subsidies, but that was funded by tax increases. Obamacare is revenue neutral and actually contributes to lowering the deficit."
Im having trouble finding sources but have heard talk that some states have changed the signup process for federal benefits. Basically if you qualify for one program you are automatically enrolled in any other program that you qualify for. While this doesnt change the population of people who deserve benefits it could be changing the number of people and the amount of benefits going out. Obviously the recession has something to do with it but something like this would explain why the total isnt shrinking the farther we get from the recession. Is this simply not true? Does anyone have any information on this?
"I hope its revenue neutral. Its kind of hard to tell as of right now since its in such early stages. I dont consider it welfare at all but Obama did help higher the poverty line for qualifying who can get more subsidies or just getting Medicaid. I dont know if increasing taxes can offset such costs just yet. Regardless, health care is one of the tricky subjects where peoples well-being is more important than money in the end."
" The characterization of what is welfare should be fleshed out...Lets say that I received Social Security since President Obama was elected, am I part of that welfare class. Amazing that someone would be quite incapable of using a search engine to discern for themselves....then they would actually learn something.....as my mom always told me - the dictionary is paid for!"
Republican Administration (Bush) Destroys Economy right before leaving office = more people unemployed = more people on welfare during Obamas Presidency. It has gotten better recently though. http://i.imgur.com/c5sxZhK.png
"This was a very good example thanks. It does look like, from that one program that welfare has gone up. It only represents SNAP but people who get SNAP usually get other from of assistance as well. And I dont really want to create my own definition of welfare. I need some kind of standard with which to go with so I understand how and why things are. There doesnt seem to be such a simple definition though."
"Thats kind of what Im wondering myself. The dictionary will give you a definition for welfare but when you look up statistics on welfare spending, there will be several charts from different groups on the same subject with different projections. And to answer your question, I did find a chart (forgot where) that grouped social security in as welfare spending. "
Tea Party Troll
http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/welfare_spending - long time chart. http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_2004_2019USb_40t - recent spending. 
"As you pointed out, it depends on what you consider welfare. Heres the governments SNAP (food stamp) [budget summary](http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/snapsummary.htm) for every year since it started. Number of participants and benefits/recipient have both gone up significantly from Bushs last year to 2013. Total spending of the program has more than doubled over that time. If you want a straight answer youll need to determine which of the programs you consider to be welfare then go to all the other government budget summary pages for those programs and look for yourself. "
"The way welfare spending usually works is, if a person applies for assistance and they meet the qualifications specified in law, they get it. More people are poor enough to qualify and need it since the recession, which started before Obama took office. Im not aware of any changes to the law or policy making it easier to qualify, only recent cuts to SNAP. Theyre just blaming him on a correlation and ignoring causation, because it doesnt fit their narrative."
"There is no welfare. Everything we get in this country is owed to us from years of sales taxes and payroll taxes. Years of SS and medicare coming out of our pay. We pay into everything and deserve anything we get from the government. Claim your right to the benefits we have at our disposal as Americans. Its your right and you paid for it. Im tired of the demonization of the great society we have built. I say take it a step further: Medicare-for-all, living wage! Public pension to supplement SS. "
"Thanks, this was very helpful, but I dont know what is considered welfare as it pertains to this charts. It seems to be all relative to who your asking. "
"http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/21ow66/can_someone_explain_to_me_whether_or_not_welfare/ Can someone explain to me whether or not welfare spending has really gone up under Obama presidency? Im not sure who or what to believe because I cant really get a straight answer.When I did a little digging, people consider Obamacare welfare (which I dont agree with) which explains why people are saying welfare spending has increased. So aside from Obamacare, has welfare increased under Obamas presidency as dramatically as is claimed?"
Yes it has. Both personal and corporate. What hasnt gone up are the wages of the poor &amp; middle class.
"Yeah, I know the recession hit hard and people will obviously need help. I dont have anything to say about that. Im just trying to verify the claims that I hear in the paper, from friends/family and TV."
On b) http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/26/rich-lowry/were-most-obamacare-sign-ups-people-who-had-insura/ I dont think this talking point of 1/3rd of enrollees is going to hold up over the long haul. 
A) The GOP will continue to pound this issue because thus far it is being predicted as a GOP Senate takeover as long as the current trajectory (bashing Obamacare) continues. B) I wouldnt go so far as to say that it has been a huge success either. Only 1/3 of current enrollees didnt have health insurance prior to Obamacare. It kinda fails at its purpose then...
"I now have health insurance, and can visit my doctor for $25. My monthly premium is going to be about $27, down from $180--what I was quoted last time I checked. I have not been to the doctor in 11 years. I am ecstatic to have a health care option and cannot wait to schedule a check up with my new doctor that the plan even helped me choose. To those people that can now visit the doctor, its a big deal."
"&gt; Only 1/3 of current enrollees didnt have health insurance prior to Obamacare. It kinda fails at its purpose then... 1. Obamacare has insured 9.5 million Americans who previously did not have insurance. You call that failure, I call that helping 9.5 million Americans. And without impacting the deficit, which has been dropping consistently since Obama took office. 2. Obamacare wouldve insured a hell of a lot more people before republicans gutted the shit out of it. Fact is, this is not Obamacare, this is watered-down Romneycare. But its better than nothing, and you cant blame Obama for Boehners choices. 3. Additionally, Republican Governors are refusing to take federal medicaid money, because then theyd have to pass it on to the icky poor people in their state. Thereby further watering-down Obamacare and hurting the people in their states. All Democrats have to do is convey these truths to the public, rather than sticking to Republican talking points, and theyd be able to make some headway popularity-wise."

Are you willing to give up everything for a revolution that may not improve your life? Are you willing to give up everything for the next generation? People are just dumb and sedated enough to not give a fuck about whats happening to them, and theres a strong argument to be made that, why should they? They have food. They have roofs. They have clothes. They have entertainment. They have the facade of happiness. I just dont think enough people (a) give enough of a fuck to cause change or (b) are smart enough to do so without resorting to violence ... and *they* have the guns, not us."

34 years of tax cuts for the wealthy + compound interest =todays billionares
Capitalism.
"Theres nothing wrong with being rich in and of itself. The problem arises when the rich are able to effect laws that suppress and take advantage of the poor, imo"
I suggest reading Nobel Prize Winner Joseph Stiglitz latest book The Price of Inequality. It really details a lot of what is wrong in America today.
[Heres a video link to the interview in case it hasnt been posted.](http://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2013-10-24/russell-brand-lets-rip-on-jeremy-paxman/)
"# #1 Issue - Noone cares about the 85 million poorest including the 85 million poorest. Instead, everyone wants to be one of the 300, and the average American is terrible at math."
"Is it an accident, I am one of the 85 million, or is it just the odds?"
Utilitarian solution: Kill/harm 300 people and double the quality of life of 85 million people. Rational solution: Define P[get past bodyguards/Law - seize assets - redistribute assets]
"Poor people are sheep. Its not coincidence this is so. Yes, both."
"Its maybe important to note that many of the poorest 85 million Americans have no wealth at all...or rather, they have negative net worth. So if you have a positive net worth, *you* have the same amount of wealth as more than 60 million americans."
"could Libertarian Socialism be a thing? see, you get the righties with the first part and the lefties with the second. "
"Eyup. And theyre a very touchy and sensitive bunch, who bristle at the very notion that they ought to be subject to a higher tax rate. Such delicate little flowers."
Have 1 dollar in your pocket? No debt? Congrats your in the top 50%
"I am embarrassed to admit that Russel Brand was the *last* famous person that I expected to rise to the occasion with such a huge bang and defend the little people. Very, very impressed and again, embarrassed to admit that I pre-judged him as some washed out freak. I have learned a very valuable lesson and will never judge someone again. I am delightfully amazed and stand alongside The New Re-Branded Russell Brand."
"I really dont see much difference in our current economic system and Fuedal Serfdom. The common laborer works for a company which gives them in return for said work enough money to subsist (if they are lucky) and the company keeps the rest of the profits generated by that persons labor. If my job results in $150,000 in profit for the company and they only pay me $40,000 well thats no different than a serf giving 2/3 of their crops to the Lord who thinks he is doing him a favor letting him work his land just like companies think they are doing us a favor by giving us a job. We are all still serfs working for the nobleman. "
"Russells tapping into a tragic recurrence of world history and a concern shared by JFK: Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable...JFK, from first anniversary of the Alliance for Progress, March 13, 1962 Update: To the generous soul who shared their gold...Thank you for your kindness!"
"This statistic is probably true, but Im still having a bit of trouble with the fact that its a Russel Brand quote from *voiceofrussia.com*."
"Its gonna start trickling down any day now, guys. Relax."
"This argument is misleading. Lets say you have $1 and no debt. How many millions of Americans do you have more wealth than? As Donald Trump once told his kid back when he was $1B in debt, See that homeless man over there? Technically, he has more net worth than me. A more reasonable stat would be 300 Americans have the same amount of wealth as XXX median-wealth Americans."
http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2013_10_25/Comedian-Russell-Brand-predicts-revolution-in-new-interview-2114/ 300 Americans have the same amount of wealth as their 85 million poorest Americans - Russel Brand

"From the comments here it seems like people are waiting for a complete systemic meltdown involving poverty, food scarcity and water deprivation? Is that really how bad it has to get before anyone is willing to do anything? I really believe that the West is utterly complacent and that (sadly) Brands effort will be completely buried by next week. We bring it on ourselves."
I wonder what the sum of wealth that Hollywood has compares to the poors wealth in America. 
"It isnt just the top 300, it would be everyone in america has more wealth than the bottom 85 Million. [20% of households](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/basics/story/2012-05-12/households-net-worth-university-of-michigan/54912016/1) have owe more money than they currently have. So if you combine that it would be a pretty large negative number. "
Those 85 million in one hand shake their fists and with the second buy the new ipad. 
Really what does anyone expect in the worlds largest plutocracy
[deleted]
So what? What is anyone going to do about this?
Not sure voice of russia is a valid source for anything not russian
Thanks for telling me this but what Im more interested in is a lessons in how to get to the top 300 Americans. 
"Hmm, wondering if voiceofrussia.com also talks about concentration of wealth in ... wait for it ... Russia."
"Lots of people have zero or negative wealth. At least 30 million I am guessing? So were all richer than that group (no human could be that poor). Then you add people with money to outweigh the negative. That brings you to maybe 50 million people to get to zero wealth. I am pretty sure I have more money than the bottom 50 million. But, our richest 1 million people have more money than god."
"* the top 1 percent own 40 percent of U.S. wealth, * the bottom 80 percent own just 7 percent of Americas wealth http://www.businessinsider.com/inequality-is-worse-than-you-think-2013-3 "

"/politics was already dead, but a Russel Brand quote on the front page just skullfucked the decomposing corpse."
Lets start scratching more. 
Brands making some enemies eh? Hes fuckin right tho
Simpsons did it.
Only if they still have their heads. 
"Sorry to interrupt the new Communist revolution, but this is due to many of those people having a net worth of *less than zero*. Chances are *you* have greater worth than the bottom few million poorest people. Not saying that its right or good, or that Brand hasnt made some points I happen to have agreed with for a long time, but this isnt the most useful thing to take away from what he said."
Loses meaning coming from a *multimillionaire British man.* 
"The way I see it, taxes are a kick in the balls/vagina. Every single citizen who earns income over a certain threshold should be kicked in the balls/vagina. The 1% should pay far far more tax than they should so that their kicks to the balls/vaginas feel painful as everybody elses kicks. Same pain for everybody. The end. "
I just hope I can amass enough wealth before then 
Then those 85 million should catch up.
Why did he not mention the UK. Theres only about 20 families with 98% of their wealth. 
Then those 85 million should catch up.

voiceofrussia russel brand lmao
This is funny coming from a Russian website. Wonder if they read the npr article a couple weeks ago where it was shown that 35% of household wealth in Russia is in the hads of only 110 people. Seems legit
"As much as I like Brand, lately all hes been doing is spurting out tired idealistic rhetoric. Everyones going yay Russel! but its no different to what weve heard millions of times before. What we need is action."
"The numbers do not tell the whole story here. The American lower class, by all standards, is significantly better off than the lower class of the rest of the world. A family of 3 making $19,530 or less is considered in poverty in the US, yet that kind of money is several times greater than the salary of the average poor person in most other countries. "
What does Ja think about this? somebody find Ja Tule so I can make sense of this!
Who needs Nobility and Kings when wealth follows in line anyway? These guys have more power than any Emperor or Count of old... 
"Those 300 people were mostly people that started and/or own the biggest companies in America such as Walmart, Microsoft, etc. Are those people not entitled to the shares of their own companies that are making them so wealthy? "
Probably gonna buried ... but doesnt the Walton family (6 people) have as much wealth as 150 million Americans ? We definitely need a revolution. A real revolution. A redistribution of wealth. Everyone plays by the same rules. Education should be free and not for profit. Healthcare should be free and not for profit. Should I keep going ?
"As easy as it is for rich people to get richer, its even easier for poor people to get poorer. "
This is the single worst comment section Ive ever seen.
Cause Russell brand means politics
Poverty is not a zero-sum game. Rich people do not have to become poor for other people to get richer.
Okay Russell Brand is on record. Up next: Mike The Situation on foreign policy. And can somebody please find out [what Ja Rule thinks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo-ddYhXAZc)
"While I agree with his overall sentiment, I dont share his pride in voter apathy. I really hope this revolution doesnt cause the voter turnout to drop (#dontvote? ha.). If your goal is a major paradigm shift in the political landscape, then yes, your vote doesnt make much direct difference. However, voting can make more granular differences - see Elizabeth May in Saanich-Gulf Islands (first elected Green Party Member in Canadian parliament). It can introduce different voices into the political charade. There are smaller, less important policies, laws, and issues that are definitely effected by even a small number of votes -- and to forfeit your obligation to take part in the democratic process, as futile as it might seem when looking at the bigger picture, is just irresponsible. I cant say for certain what will or wont happen if you and I vote. However, I can GUARANTEE you that nothing happens when we all sit on our ass and cite the ineffectiveness of voting as a culprit of democratic corruption. All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing - Burke EDIT: accidentally a word"
Someone explain to the world why I dont care about what Russel Brand says or thinks. Or for that matter why anyone would follow the man.
"This is a typical media device. Show that they are acting upon what the public want but present it in a way that undermines the ideology. They put a hairy idiot on the TV and pressed him on his ideas. Ideas that are sound and justified and that are upheld by the masses. While reinforcing that Russell is correct Paxman legitimises the issues but equally shows that change is futile, irresponsible and not sustainable. The media will never interview a person and broadcast a sound reasoning for any political debate. In the UK we have Question Time. A show that on the face of it looks like were having an open political debate; however, the people on the panel do nothing but squabble. They frequently say things have to change, to loud applause but there are no answers or alternatives on the show. This creates the image that makes the audience think. Hell yes, something is going to be done, the media are our voice! But really its a massive circle jerk. This is why as Glasnostic says we seem to constantly be on the bounds of change but nothing ever happens. Far from the media being a voice for the people they mute are screams with hairy and miss informed idiots. Edit: Spelling"
I read this as 300 Armenians...
And Republicans rush to defend these job creators as people who somehow deserve unlimited untaxed income
"This makes the US look like one big slave plantation with the few occupying the ruling class and the many working having what they produce taken from them by the political/economic system. Wait. If it looks like it is a slave plantation is it. Economic fascism is the collusion of corporations, wealthy individuals, and special interest groups with politicians to rig the economy in their own favor at the expense of everyone else. Why do you think people make big political contributions? Out of the generosity of their own hearts? I think not. They do it so politicians will pass laws that favor them. But the economic advantage they are granted by these laws put everyone else at a disadvantage. It is like one football team having 11 players and the other having 5. Which one always wins? Of course the gullible public falls for the line that these laws are there to protect the public. Protect and serve; bullshit. I know the public is gullible because they cant even figure out that this is not freedom, so they blame the free market. Clue boys; free market economies produce a normal bell curve distribution of wealth with few in poverty, and are not rigged by governments; they are controlled by competition. All the robber barons of the 19th century became so because of laws that protected them and gave them advantage. It is the same today with banks, Wall Street, drug companies, and numerous other segments of the economy scamming the rest of us with their government granted privileged positions. In the whole history of the world there have been very few private organizations that gained a monopoly position by competing, and these only did so because they delivered good products at low prices. When the government steps in, you get poor products at high prices. Wake up. If you want to eliminate this skewed distribution of wealth, demand that government remove itself from the economy except to punish fraud, theft, and collusion to rig markets. Demand freedom. Otherwise you will have slavery, and the big slave plantation on which you now live will only make your life worse, and deservedly so if you are foolish enough to clamor for more government control."
"Thanks for the update on Russel Brand and Steve Buscemis views in the past week, r/politics."
Not all wealthy people are bad. Stop being a dick because youre poorer. 
"I literally had an argument with my roommates trying to explain to them how the wealth disparity in America is terrible and that a lot of people dont even get a living wage while people like Donald Trump have billions and only help people with it for tax and PR purposes. Their response? The poor people didnt try hard enough, and they dont deserve to earn a living wage for working 40 hours a week. One of them kept trying to convince me that if anyone tries hard enough, they could even play professional basketball. I mean, really? I couldnt shake them from this idea that people shouldnt make a living wage if they didnt get an education or dont try hard enough. I tried to explain different circumstances that would lead to someone not being able to pursue an education. (or a sports dream, which can be shattered with a broken bone) They countered with an argument that 40 hours isnt even half of the time they are awake in a week. Then stuff about their economics classes explaining to them that if the minimum wage was increased and everyone was employed, our entire economy would collapse. Obviously there always needs to be a small pool of unemployment for hiring reasons, but come on. Anyone have any idea what I could say to them that might change their minds?"
"So, instead of the story being about what Russell Brand said, the story is that Russell Brand said something. Fantastic. "
"I dont see the problem? Most of them have worked hard and reaped the rewards from the free market. Good for them. I really hate the whole rich people are cunts attitude this place has. Im poor as dirt btw. Maybe we should be looking at why is everyone so poor? rather than that guy has more money than me, fuck him"
"Youll always be able to say, *X* Americans have the same amount of wealth as the *Y* million poorest Americans. Its just a matter of math. "
"I dont get why this crap keeps coming to the front page... some people are rich, some arent... its America, if you dont like your situation, change it and stop complaining. "

Funny I post the actual YouTube interview yesterday and get 8 upvotes and someone posts excerpts of the interview on an an obscure Web site and it gets on the front page. I give up on Reddit. 
So strip the 300 of their wealth and rights will even everything out
kill them :) 
My issue with him is his idea of redistribution of wealth. No free society can take forcefully take money from another and give to another based on the idea that they make to much. Everything else I totally agree with him on.
I never understood why we started taking political advice from Hollywood.
The question no one is asking... How Are they Continuing to Make Trillions of Dollars for THEMSELVES?
Is Russell the new messiah? Im cool with that just wanna make sure
"As an American with 0 dollars in a room full of Americans with 0 dollars, it doesnt seem surprising, if you have change in your pocket your doing better then millions of us. "
The article itself is poorly written and the message is terrible too. Complains but doesnt vote to help change the status quo and pines for a revolution in which he surely would not be on the side of the poor. Mass commercialization is part of the reason anyone even pays attention to this clown.
"The interview is from the BBC, so dont say things like Like Im going to trust voiceofrussia!, it was posted from around 4 different UK sources yesterday. Thats fine if you dont trust the original sources, lets just not try make this an Russia vs the world thing."
is it just me or the reporter is kinda laughing at him because what he says doesnt make sense
Voiceofrussia.com Now do the same for russia
"Is there any publicly available data to substantiate this claim that 300=85,000,000, or put differently that 300 Americans are as wealthy as close to 25% of total US population? If there is, Russell is right. "
I surprised to see the rise of Communism in the US in the past few years. 
And them being rich made you poor how? If your of the type sitting around waiting for the Government to Tax the working class more to give it to the none working class you deserve what you have and in actuality you are stealing the money that could increase the amount the truly needy could be receiving. Living off the tax payers generation after generation is not a safety net its a hammock!!

Brand underestimates the general apathy of the people.
"Heres my take... I dont mind our government catering to corporations. That is, if it is done wisely....and its not being done that way. For instance, they claim that we need to cater to corporations because they create jobs. And when people have jobs, they have money. And when they have money, they can spend it. Which necessitates more jobs and stimulates the economy. However, they currently give breaks to large corporations and those additional dollars go directly into their pockets. So why dont they make these big breaks available to large corporations IN EXCHANGE for the effect they are desiring? Instead of assuming that giving them loads of tax breaks will make them create jobs....how about we give them tax breaks FOR CREATING JOBS? If your median employee makes 10% of your CEOs salary...tax break. If you provide healthcare and PTO to your employees...tax break. If you have a net increase of jobs...tax break. etc. Instead of just handing them money and saying Now you go do some good in the community with this money, why dont we just say Do some good in the community, and youll get a tax break."
"The new thinly disguise aristocratic class. Wealth is inherited. Strike down wealth inheritance, thats all Im advocating."
Fuck yea!

TIL Russel Brands economic and historical opinion is important. /r/politics circlejerk is going hard today.
"Is this a bad thing? I could see if this was income - but weve discussed and struck down a wealth tax many times. Weve accepted that though those who make more should pay more, they also should see long-term results of their perceived success. "
"Listen to everyone, follow no one. Remember this guy has more money than all of us combined. There have been countless intelligent conversations that convey what he is saying, yet hes the one we see on interviews that make national headlines."
"Isnt this exactly what the whole I am the 99% thing came from? ..... why is this news again, I thought we had already learned this/had loads of protests"
"The problem here is that so many people are convinced that people pointing out these inequalities consider the arguments to be in favor of a redistribution of wealth. That is not the case for most. The issue isnt that they make lots of money, it is that theyve stacked the deck to KEEP their money at the cost of the lower income people. We dont need redistribution, we need equal costs across the board. Tax the rich as you tax the poor. No loopholes, no offshoring, no breaks."
Thats a pretty safe comment given that the 85 million poorest are likely at $0. 
Plutocracy
"I wouldnt want the nations wealth with the poorest, no more then the rich"
You people make him sound so intelligent
that pretty much sums up how Ive been feeling with the current political atmosphere.
"I would have loved to read the article, but that website is unusable on mobile. "
"Has anyone seen the full interview this is quoted from? Russell Brand is a comedian trying his hand at BRITISH politics with his typical psychotic dog and pony show. The facts arent wrong, but I certainly wouldnt want Russell Brand as my figurehead."
"Holy shit, /r/politics once again proves it is the dumbest subreddit on this website. Its a fucking transcript from a TV interview with a guy who has literally no expertise on economics or the United States or solutions to poverty. I really cant believe you upvote this stupid shit...I just cant."

"&gt;voiceofrussia.com Okay, so if the Russians wanna take a swing at our inequality of wealth, how is theirs? "
"I take it voiceofrussia.com has begun spamming reddit today? Never heard of them before, make it to my front page twice in two hours this morning."
Would anyone mind posting the video to Vimeo? I cant access YouTube from work...
"I have given up on the state of our government. I have nothing to offer in help, and have decided to sit by and watch the consequences of what the leaders of this country have sewn. I am simply a bystander. "
"My God, Brand is so incredibly quick and articulate. His arguments - albeit general - certainly make you think about the status quo."
"Dudes worth $15 Million, and he thinks profits are filthy?"
Lets Robin Hood these guys
"Im so sick of this false argument appearing over and over here. If those 300 people never existed, those 85 million would have NO MORE money than they already do. This argument assumes that wealth is a fixed and finite resource, which it just isnt. "
THIS. IS. SPARTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
[deleted]
can someone tell me why there is so much recent propaganda making it negative to have money? communist propaganda 101... 
shits stirring up. i can feel it
[deleted]
This isnt Sparta... this IS madness.
"Rich people are richer than poor people. Its not fair, we get it."
Link to [interview](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24648651)
"Dear Mr. Brand, When the uprising you call for actually occurs, the rabble will be coming for YOUR head, too. Youre like *rich*, and stuff. Love, The Rabble, Inc."
"I think a better way to phrase this tiny group has as much money as this huge group of people would be to say it like Imagine the 300 richest people in America have an average of $85 million each, while the poorest 85 million Americans have an average of $300 to their name. Maybe thats more complicated than the former."
Has this really changed in the past 4000 years? What makes people think things would be different in our times?
"So can we get a list of these 300 people and get started? I mean theyve all got access to us, so why dont get get some access to them?"
Oh thank goodness that bipolar drug addicted alcoholic comedians from England are now weighing in on Americas financial situation. 
"This revolution has been going on for years, and its a little sad to know that the first time the world sees it is when a celebrity brings it to light. Dont get me wrong, he did an incredible thing. But maybe you should think twice before you dismiss activist journalists as conspiracy nuts."
Why is this statistic in the form of a Russel Brand quote? What difference does it make that he said it? 
"If you havent seen it, [I Am (2010)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1741225/) is highly recommended. Its a documentary by Tom Shadyac, the director of such hits as Bruce Almighty and Nutty Professor, about his own awakening."
Could someone please explain this to me? Im not sure if Im reading it wrong or I just dont know what hes talking about.
Is there something wrong with fact?
Is this supposed to make me feel bad? Because it doesnt. There will always be rich &amp; poor; haves and have-nots.
"Wow, that was horribly written..."
"Russell Brand is an actor, stand up comedian, and radio host with a net worth of $15 million. Something about glass houses and stones or pots and kettles. I dont remember exactly."
"If Russell Brand says, that, were not quite as egalitarian as he thinks... the bottom 60% have maybe 5% of the wealth."
Is this news because some British dude said it? We all knew this.
Thanks again voiceofrussia for this informative and non-biased Article!!
"Funny to see this headline from a Russian news outlet, considering they have the largest divide between the rich and the poor, with 100 people representing &gt;35% of the nations wealth (richest 100 people in most other countries represent 1-2% or their nations wealth)."
"Yeah, and theres plenty of people that make over 100k per year that have no wealth, and are included in that bucket, because they spend every dime they make."
I really wish we would quit focusing on the wealth of others.
"Can we stop glamorising russel brand now please? Hes right of course, but he has no solutions at all. Its infantile."
Yawn. Why does anyone care what Russel Brand thinks?
So glad someone finally said this.
"I dont know if its been posted in here, but [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk) is the interview (10:46) its pretty good."
Why do so many people on this thread think that some ridiculous actor is viewed by the US government as a threat? Nice try FSB. 
"But of course, if you were to suggest those 300 might use the cash to influence politics its suddenly a Kooky Conspiracy Theory. I mean, obviously people with that kind of cash and world view wouldnt want to influence their own tax code in any way..."
"I think if you look at revolutions, the rich or those in control of the revolutions will benefit from them monetarily. The average person will be the one to suffer. Violent revolutions are only sometimes good in the long run. "
did anyone read the side stories linked to the voice of Russia... I think someone is rooting for Americas downfall. 
"However the knee jerk policies and movements people always propose as the result if articles such as this never effect those three hundred, only the 10-20 million trapped between the rich and the poor working their asses off."
"You know, I actually dont care that these 300 people eat 95% of the potluck. I really dont. However, I demand that they bring 95% of the potluck next time. They currently only bring something like 35-40% of it."
"Its not the political system ? its the monetary system that causes this. And its not Republican or Democrat ? its far bigger than that. Its global, and its a monetary system designed to siphon wealth from the working class to the banks and governments who designed the system. In the end, it doesnt matter who you vote for, we have a monetary system that is built to enrich the banking class and the government at the expense of the working class. You cannot change this without changing the monetary system."
"One thing Ive always wondered though is how does this compare to history on a per capita basis. Also, can some of it be attributed to exponential population growth? I mean in the 20s there were basically like 10 guys who literally owned all supply chains, and in medieval times kings probably did have a similar level of wealth."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk#t=306 Source. I am sure its here somewhere but I didnt see it 
This is a big disingenuous seeing as about 4.2million american households have a negative net worth that is negative. So if I have $0.25 in my pocket I already have a net worth greater then about 11million people. I cant find the statistic anymore but I remember reading something that 1/3 of the country has a net worth of less then $100k
"No doubt that society isnt as just as it should be, but framing revolution as inevitable because the global situation has been steadily deteriorating for generations is simply not true. Though it doesnt feel like it because we are in it, current society is going through an unprecedented time of peace and prosperity. Does that mean everything is perfect? No. But it also doesnt mean that things are on a steady path of deterioration that current political systems cannot possibly rectify. His main concerns of income inequality and climate change could be fixed in the US with a simple change: altering campaign finance. If moneyed interest didnt have so much influence, these things would be solved already. Is campaign finance change impossible? Absolutely not. It was already done by McCain-Fiengold. The SCOTUS struck a lot of that down. Does that mean it could never pass again? Absolutely not. If there were popular support, we could amend the Constitution to fix this. Thats not easy, but easy isnt the point. The point is the system can in fact handle these problems. The people (citizens who dont participate in democracy to help their own situation) are the broken ones. The problems arent fixed because they arent smart enough or working hard enough to fix them. "
Russell came back hard from that drug binge to be a pretty enlightened individual.
"The title is exactly the same situation as Louis XVI and the Court of Versailles. All you need is a serious financial crunch where mothers cant feed their babies and people will come with torches to the homes of those 300 demanding they pay. Im just saying history. If the rich do not learn from the past and realize they need the poor to have a basic level of living, and that they actually profit more from a strong middle class, they are bound to repeat it. Now do I foresee guillotines? No. Do I see them being dragged out of their beds at midnight by groups and forced to walk miles to the local jail? Maybe. Do I see hackers stripping their offshore and local bank accounts down to zero, selling their investments and giving it to everyone else? Maybe. Could I see a group collectively destroying all college debt records at sallie mae, down to the tape backups? Maybe. Theres this thing in nature. If an equilibrium between an entity and its environmental is not obtained on its own, the environment will destroy the entity in order to create the equilibrium itself. Its been throughout history, from a microscopic level, to the largest animals in the world. But without addressing the poor, and things constantly getting worse for them while they continue to play money games on who has the bigger bank account and the largest yacht WILL eventually provoke a reaction. Im just reciting history. Maybe theyll get smart, fix things and prevent it from happening, but I seriously doubt it."
my question to that fact is....so what?
Cant we all just be happy with what we have? Dam
"Ok Russell, lets start with you. Begin re-distributing your massive wealth to the poorest in the US right now. Youre only allowed to keep 1% of . Get started, I dont have all day"
All the money in the US is either spent pacifying the populous or collecting money into giant economically useless piles. This is why even people who exclusively subsist off of food stamps almost all have smart phones.
Why is Russel Brand getting credit for quoting statistics used in popular social science books? And why is he everywhere on reddit today?
"What an extreme contrast of ideas and generations, Paxman seems like he honestly doesnt get it. Russell Brand explains it all so well and these are the same issues Kanye West has been talking about, too. There is no reason not to take these people seriously because we label them as entertainers, our current constructs on where authority and power come from are extremely outdated and narrow-minded. People can literally be and do ANYTHING. There is no reason to continue to promote the current systems in place throughout the world when we have the massive amount of tools, knowledge and resources to make it all so much better. The only thing holding us back is the fact that a select elite are holding onto their ability to gouge the majority of the population for their time and money, granting them power."
THIS. IS. [**THE ONE PERCENT!**](http://i.imgur.com/VIsrPgJ.jpg)
"Just a quick note, there are 63 million registered democrats and 45 million registered republicans. The 2016 vote, as it has been the past few elections, will be about voter turnout. "
"What percentage of his money has he given away? Curious as he may not be in the top 300, but he is more wealthy than the average person for sure."
"Youre all a bunch of dirty commies. Now get a friggin job and obey the rules. With love, -Your beloved corporate overlords. "
Its just money. If you go through life full of envy youll never enjoy what you have.

X-axis plots percentile of the American population and the area under the graph between two x-values shows how large portion of the total wealth that portion of the population hold. Both fractions mentioned owns 0.0014% of the total American wealth. 
How much of his salaries from movies has Russel Brand donated to the underclass. How about Kanye?

We wouldnt have enterprising individuals such as Elon Musk (co-founder of Tesla and Paypal when it was good) if we didnt allow people to become rich. Even very rich. Hes gonna help save the planet for crying out loud.
I wonder what that figure would be in Russia
"20% of Americans have negative net worth. This isnt about how much money the top has, its about how 60 million Americans are in net debt, and frankly I think this is a more powerful statistic. I, some schmuck whos doing pretty well but no way near the top 1% or top 500, has more wealth than the 85 million poorest combined in the US. And you could spin this all you want, the poorest in the U.S. are worse off than the poorest in India, because no one loans money to the poorest in India. Some homeless dude on the street in the U.S. has more wealth than 80 million Americans combined. Lesson: statistics quoted in headlines with no context mean very little. But you do learn a lot if you dig past the spin. "

what if Russel Brand was really the 2nd coming of jesus. What if god was one of us? Just a slob like one of us?
"When war happens, are these 300 going to defend us? Or we are going defend them?"
How many poor Americans is Russel Brands net worth equal to?
"Personally, I think revolution will take the form of prison breaks. If the USA cannot reliably lock people away as it currently can, then changes must be addressed. Saint Leonard brings hope to all imprisoned souls! Hope that they may be freed."
"voiceofrussia again reddit? Really? I knew this shit 2 years ago before occupy happened. 85 million / 300 = 283,333 So for each person of the top 300, they effectively own 283,333 human beings. Each one of them has 283,333 human beings in the United States working to produce wealth for them."
"Why is this quote even needed here? Didnt we already go over this in the Occupy movement? I agree with what he says, but the 300 Americans have same wealth stuff isnt news unless youve been living under a rock."

ITT people talk about tax rates and how different policies could fix the issues. But the people deciding on the tax rates make more money than us and dont want to tax themselves or those that are more rich than them who pay to lobby for different causes. Its all money. Its all greed. Its all fucked. Its just corporate America dancing off beat to the rhythm. 
"Uh...so lets take it from them. Its not really theirs to horde in such unnecessary quantity, and there is like 85 million of us to 300 of them. They are fucked..."

"As measured by amount of what, cash, bonds, real estate? How are we measuring wealth. I dont have much money, but a home family and advanced degree, happiness. I think I am pretty wealthy. Seems only political folks and materialistic people see wealth as money. "
"This issue is one of the ones I am most passionate about. We have finally reached that point where there is too much derived capital in the world. The simplest explanation is this: Capital is a finite resource. Think of all the money in a certain economy as a slices of a pie, every time you add more money to the system the individual slice of pie shrinks in its overall % (value). Corporations that grow billions of dollars in financial products do so at the expense of the purchasing power of the dollar. We as a nation must start taxing derived wealth at a higher rate to give more equity to the dollar. Money as a rule generally travels up the SES chain. if you think about how you spend your money, youre usually paying for something from an entity with a higher net worth than yourself. If we make it harder for people to conjure money from derivatives we simultaneously increase the purchasing power of the dollar. Its time to tax the shit out of capital gains or at least make the capital gains definition less broad. Doing this and reinstating the payroll tax holiday on a permanent basis would do more for the economy than anything weve done to date. "
"This quote may very well contain a true fact but **why not cite the source Russell Brand used instead of his direct quote???** This is /r/politics, not /r/celebrities, and I highly doubt Brand conducted the research himself"

Providing commentary on world issues is easy. Actually doing something about it is HARD.
I feel like that would be true to a certain extent anywhere. So rich as fuck ppl ( millions pushing billions) have he same amount of money as a whole lot more of poor people. 
"I enjoyed this article. Just one thing to say thats not necessarily related to the article. If you vote for either of the 2 most popular parties in the upcoming elections in 2016, you will be voting for a person that puts corporations ahead of citizens. We must have a real, honest person that is willing to do what is right for America. The two dominant parties answer to corporations and work for them first and foremost. The idea of voting for the lesser of 2 evils will not help us. A revolution is absolutely necessary. As George Carlin said so succinctly: They got us by the balls! (this is coming from someone who has voted in the past 3 elections Ive been eligible for and at this point, Im fed up and wont be complicit in this corporate political system)."
Dig what hes saying? Then stop over at /r/socialism lets get some ideas rolling around.
if only we could get them all in the same dark alley and mug them :)
"If you have 0 debt, you have more wealth than 30some% of americans."
"Hes twisting things a bit, but thats his persona. If you have $10 in your pocket and no debt, you also have more than the poorest 85 million americans combined."
"While this might seem callous but it may eventually come down to this. People have killed for much much less than a million and we are talking about the most powerful and influential people in the US, if not the world. The collective wealth of the top 1% can buy countries. Except for the few who made their wealth in their lifetime, and understand what it means to be poor, the majority of the top 1% are far removed from normal peoples lives. Such wealth are not usually accumulated in one lifetime, as such these people simply cannot possibly imagine what it means to be poor, middle class. So lets top pretending that these people are like regular joes. They are not. What they do know is their lifestyle and the power they command. They create this system to benefit them and as a collective will work to maintain the status quo, if not, skewed it even more to their advantage. They will not give up their privilege without a fight and they have a lot of weapons in their arsenal. But what about the rest of us? The middle class is disappearing, the poor becomes poorer and jobs are getting harder to come by. Work become more stressful. Raising a family is getting harder and more expensive. You are living paycheck to paycheck, if you have a job. You look into your bank account and realized you have not enough money to even pay off the mortgage next month, much less saving for retirement, even less for college fund for your kids. You realized the dire situation you are in but there pretty much nothing you can do. Everyone around just keep saying to suck it up, rich people deserve their wealth blah blah as you see your government just keep kowtowing to special interests, the powerful and the wealthy. Eventually, possibly in the near future, the wealth distribution will get to a point that no one can ignore the obvious. Most of us will be living in hovels while across the grass divide are grand mansions. There is something wrong with this country. People becomes desperate, crimes soar as organized crimes ravaged the cities and police are less about serving the public and more about keeping the masses from the vandalizing the ten feet tall glided fence of the mansions. Entire neighborhood falls into lawlessness. Votings are rigged. Politicians are bought off. Corruptions reach new dizzying heights. Nothing really gets done in the government. All the while, the wealthy and powerful keep chugging along, oblivious to the disaster brewing around them. Let them eat cake. Then something happened, its probably very small; a botched robbery on a rich guys daughter, a protest turned violent as the a riot policeman misfired into the crowd. The poor goes wild as the sheer indignity and hopelessness translated into a real symbol and the wealthy and powerful reacted with typical ignorance, fear and brutality. So what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. An explosion. Lynching on the streets, walls are scaled, rich people are dragged out of their beds and burned alive while their daughters and wives are raped. Everything falls into anarchy as criminals took advantage of the chaos to crave themselves private kingdoms. The nation military was used to suppress the revolt. As central command falls, some commanders too, used this time to crave out their little countries as warlords. Some continue to fight for the government, some abandon the chains of command and declare the illegality of the government. All hell broke loose. One thing the wealthy and powerful and the rest of us have to understand is that such scenarios happened all time throughout history. It happened usually when there was such a skewed distribution of power, not just wealth. The wealthy became so insular and shielded to the problems of the wider world and continue to make things worse as they take and take to a point where the rest of population simply could not tolerate it anymore. Granted, to make people actually died for a cause like a revolution, you have to make people have nothing to lose and we are far from that point. However, we are at the point of the first part of this scenario. Our voting power keeps getting evaporated. The government is in stasis, unable to solve even the simplest problems because any measure that hurts the wealthy and powerful in the slightest never gets pass in the legislative. More and more people are losing their wealth and social mobility upwards grinds to a halt as people are unable to save and invest, much less putting their kids through college."
"What are we gonna do about it, comrades?"
Lets go baby 
Hes probably one of the 300. 
"He also said he beleives in a complete redistribution of wealth. It doesnt work. source: See USSR. When will stupid rich fucks like him realize the only way to counter that shit is too get more people working, pulling ourselves out of debt, its not to redistribute the tops money. Know why? Rich people dissapear, and you have even less jobs. Everyones poor. Illogical to think redistribution could ever work, long term. "
"Viva La Revolucion, Baby! Seriously looking forward to this. Maybe we can get back to where we were before Reagan and Bush destroyed the middle class at the behest of corporate America by undermining our unions. The worst thing that ever happened to this country was the Republicans and their racist pseudo Christian majority feeling threatened by a minority that was starting to make money through unions. Why should Blacks (dont call them African Americans because that would mean we admit that slavery was a bad thing) and Hispanics be paid the same as white people the republicans ask? Seriously, this was a discussion in church when I was a kid. The Christian Conservative Right is no more than a thinly veiled KKK offshoot."
who knew the poor people had so much money
"Rich people arent the problem (i hate saying rich people because thats a meaningless generalization), money is the problem... and money isnt going anywhere. Money can buy anything; votes, laws, armies... Hell in america, money is used to brainwash so many people into voting against their own interests. Money buys power, its always been this way and we can all wish for utopian societies but that aint gonna happen. The best we can do is look at countries where people seem the happiest, where things like a free education and universal healthcare arent even up for debate, and do the best we can to adapt that model to our respective countries. PS: forgive my english, its not exactly my first language."
Americans even outsource their reloutionary leaders. 
Quite the circle jerk
"Consider though, that an extremely wealthy philanthopist such as Bill Gates, will do far more to improve the quality of life for humankind than if such wealth was distributed evenly throughout society. Say you suddenly made 5% more money. Would you funnel most of that to charity or other social causes? Unlikely. And even if you did, it wouldnt be in an efficient, goal-directed manner, you would have to go through existing charities, regardless of their performance. So the problem is not that there are extremely wealthy people. Its that most of them are not using that wealth to help society. One could even argue that it is better to have a fewer number of people with wealth, so it is clear who is not doing good for society. Add in too many layers of indirection, like government, and no one has a clue who is really at fault for our slow decline. "
"I find it amazing how quickly you all turn to violent means of revolution. Its like an unaccounted fantasy...American identity is so contingent on violence and conquest, its interesting to see the thoughts on this, although I know none of it will be acted out. Maybe we should be focusing our efforts on different agents of change which will spark off real political discussion in the wider community (as opposed to just reddit) - protests are the first steps to any real change. "
"But unless Ive misread op doesnt say revolution is coming. He is replying to a comment that suggests revolution happens just as often as the second coming. Point is the first is frequent, the second is not so much."
"Im of the firm opinion that a revolt is not possible at least in the US and that the only way we will see change is marginally. The only way to improve the current system is by active participation. By that I mean governmental participation. A large, progressive wing of the Congress as stubborn as the Tea Party is necessary to push it in the right direction. Unfortunately, many smart liberal types opt for simpler lives in the private sector and do not have as much ambition for power. Thats my theory anyway. Happy to see Brand voice his opinion. "
An oligarchy of plutocrats. Degradation of Regimes anyone? 
Did he make this comment from inside his multimillion dollar home?
"2/3 of all wealth in America comes directly from inheritance. Most wealthy people, that is, did absolutely nothing to earn their wealth. If you adjust business success rate by existing wealth, the earned wealth comes almost entirely from inherited advantage."
Brand seems like a good guy but cant we get a better representative for our cause...Elizabeth Warren perhaps?
Well ya. People with mortgages and student loans have negative worth. This isnt shocking.
Probably doesnt change too much if you take 300 middle class individuals combined income and compare it to all the homeless in the United states.
"In all fairness, anyone with a thousand bucks in the bank has more wealth than a a few million of the poorest Americans... simply because they have absolutely nothing..."
Why would this need to be quoted? Its either a fact or it isnt 
85 million vs 300 I like those odds. Surely theres a handful of ex-marines among the 85 million that could handle this situation cleanly?
Give them nothing! But take from them...EVERYTHING!
Common people are starting to feel more in touch with Russell Brands views than they do with their politicians. And there are billions of common people.
"Thats nice, too bad no one is gonna do shit about it."
"i dont see a problem with this, plebs"
How can you have violent revolution if drones can strike you down so easily?
"Theres nothing to discredit or shame, guys. He has no concept of economics. While hes eloquent and well-spoken, his argument hold little value. Massive wealth redistribution and heavy taxation of corporations would destroy any sort of living comfort anybody has. We would all be living in government housing projects surviving on food rations. Profits should be eliminated? Thats the icing on the cake in this uninformed rant. No profits = no business = no jobs = extreme poverty. Please, for all of our sakes, read a little bit and get a firm understanding of economics before hailing this man as a revolutionary. Try to get past the fancy words and pleasing speech patterns."
The solution is Bitcoin.
We need to get the money out of politics. When the uber rich cant manipulate government to favour themselves then real reform is possible.

It wouldnt have helped. Democrats couldnt even pass a budget when they had control of the house and the senate and the white house. 
[deleted]
"Democrats passed a budget April 29th, 2009. ([source](http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/apr/26/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-senate-dems-havent-passed-budget/)) And budget resolutions arent important when Republicans are just going to manufacture a new crisis every time an appropriations bill needs to be passed. Things dont work the same way under a total breakdown of procedural norms."
Paris Hilton? Is that you?
"Ya know.. When we walk into a Super Walmart and go shop throughout the store, I say to myself, Self, whoever put this thing together deserves to make a lot more money then just about ummmm... Anyone I know? What type of genius created a retail jackpot like Walmart. Such intelligence. Then theres people who dont see it from that angle, just holding up picket signs, I hate wealthy families, they are the cause of our Countrys problems. Bitch, go buy some pots and pans, a bike, and some socks. I know where all three are sold at the cheapest price in EVERY town in America. "
"Who wouldnt do the exact same thing in their position? Blame politicians who have created the climate where this is possible, not people who are taking steps to protect their wealth. Any sane person would do the same."
"The problem is they exploit tax loop holes they lobbied for, pay far less income tax as a percentage of income than their workers, and rely on the government to pay for most of their work force health care costs, food stamps, child care and affordable housing. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/31/bernie-s/sanders-says-walmart-heirs-own-more-wealth-bottom-/ http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-12/how-wal-mart-s-waltons-maintain-their-billionaire-fortune-taxes.html http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/dec/06/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-more-walmart-employees-medicaid-/ They abuse the capitalist system, buy off politicians, and then rely on socialism to maximize profits."
This doesnt mean they own more than what 40% of us make. They own more than 40% of us combined and they have never worked a day and depend on us to pay to keep their workers alive via Medicaid and food stamps.
"the waltons didnt create that, the millions of people who worked for them did."
The bottom 40 percent dont have a family member who created a store that millions of people around the world shop at. What is the problem here?
"You mean a store whose employees get paid so little they have to take out government assistance, paid for by taxpayers. Yeah, no problem there. I guess you dont mind paying taxes into the pockets of the Walton family, then."
This ^. You want vast wealth? Create something that is used globally by millions. Pissing and moaning never generated a penny.
"Politifacts primary problem is that it creates very imaginative interpretations of the comments it rates. Then, any rating is achievable; a generous reinterpretation leads to True ratings and an absurdly restricted interpretation leads to False ratings for the original comment. And as a general rule this bias breaks down along partisan lines. The site does backflips to forgive Republican statements and closes its eyes while condemning Democrats. They especially love to say of Democrats that their statements are _factually true_ but then observe some other truth outside the scope of that statement. So you see, their totally true statement was not the whole truth because it did not mention that the sky is blue, so it is therefore false/less-than-true. The wiki article on politifact has some good examples. Some of my favorites: Democrats claimed Republicans want to end Medicare __as we know it__ (emphasis added) Despite some of their articles discussing [what as we know it means](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/aug/23/did-republicans-vote-end-medicare-we-know-it/), Politifact concludes that because Republicans are not ending Medicare--it will survive in some form new and better--the Democratic claim is [False](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/20/lie-year-democrats-claims-republicans-voted-end-me/). [2012 state of the union](http://www.politifact.com/obamajobs/): Obama is correct on both counts... So we rate the statement Half True. in 29 states you can be fired for being gay is only [half true](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/07/martina-navratilova/martina-navratilova-says-you-can-be-fired-being-ga/) because even though that is legal (the only thing the claim described), your employer still might choose not to fire you. Romney called for $5 trillion in tax cuts, but claimed he would not put it in place if he could not find a way to pay for it. Thus Politifact concludes it is onlny [Half-True](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-says-romneys-plan-5-trillion-tax-cut/) to claim Romney called for $5 trillion in tax cuts but hadnt offered any specifics on how hed pay for it. Obama claimed his budget plans saved $4 trillion. But to reach that conclusion you have to count money Obama has already saved on top of what his future proposals would save. So [half-true](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-says-he-will-cut-deficits-4-trillion/). "
"Interesting, Ive not spent a lot of time on politifact, but I had the impression that it was a more reliable source for fact checking. If not there, where is there that does the same kind of work more honestly?"
Whats wrong with politifact?
&gt;over keeping the promises that he ran on in 2008 and 2012. You mean after his party lost more seats in 2010 they had even less power to do anything? And the appointment of the FCC people talked about here was done to appease Republicans who blocked all nominations? Oh and about those promises... http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/ You are full of shit!
"Youre the one thats full of shit. Obama broke his campaign promise right out of the gate in early 2009: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/mar/17/obamas-lobbyist-rules-promise-broken/ No one forced Obama to appoint Monsanto VP Michael Taylor to the FDA, or the multitude of other lobbyist appointments. Obama has and will continue to be a corporate sycophant."
So you dont like how people in the industry also work in regulation? That was his only campaign promise?

"http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/20j6dl/the_future_of_america/ The Future of America... Got this forwarded to me in an email, thought it was an interesting view towards whats occurring in America right now. Let me know what you think of it In 1887 Alexander Tyler, a Scottish history professor at the University of Edinburgh , had this to say about the fall of the Athenian Republic some 2,000 years prior: A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse over loose fiscal policy, (which is) always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the worlds greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to complacency; From complacency to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage. The Obituary follows: Born 1776, Died 2012 It doesnt hurt to read this several times. Professor Joseph Olson of Hamline University School of Law in St. Paul , Minnesota , points out some interesting facts concerning the last Presidential election: Number of States won by: Obama: 19 Romney: 29 Square miles of land won by: Obama: 580,000 Romney: 2,427,000 Population of counties won by: Obama: 127 million Romney: 143 million Murder rate per 100,000 residents in counties won by: Obama: 13.2 Romney: 2.1 Professor Olson adds: In aggregate, the map of the .territory Romney won was mostly the land owned by the taxpaying citizens of the country. Obama territory mostly encompassed those citizens living in low income tenements and living off various forms of government welfare... Olson believes the United States is now somewhere between the complacency and apathy phase of Professor Tylers definition of democracy, with some forty percent of the nations population already having reached the governmental dependency phase.. If Congress grants amnesty and citizenship to twenty million criminal invaders called illegal?s - and they vote - then we can say goodbye to the USA in fewer than five years. "
"this is basically the same thing but for 2000 election is that correct? and basically its switch around now, Obama = Gore? Are there speculations or ideas on how to fix this?"

No. I do remember congress blocking his attempts to close it though :(

Thank you for the information. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/177/close-the-guantanamo-bay-detention-center/ &gt;Even if Obama could close the prison before leaving office, Waxman noted that he is bound to leave his successor with a host of legal battles. Closing Guantanamo would bring up many more debates about armed conflict with al-Qaida and when the war on terror should be declared over. &gt;Its not that Obama has given up on the issue. Far from it. But for serious Guantanamo progress, he would need some unlikely help from Congress. Well keep our eye on the issue throughout his presidency, but for now the meter stays at Broken."
"Medicare spends a higher % of their money on providing healthcare and less on administrative costs than their private counterparts, so, yes."
"Huh. [Politifact rates that statement as true](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/30/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-medicare-overhead-far-lower-pri/) (but Barbara Boxers private-industry-at-20% figure as squishy), which blows my mind."

But I know [facts dont matter to your side](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-provided-90-billion/). &gt;Of the $90 billion handed out, less than $1 billion has been lost, even counting two other failures Romney didnt mention: Beacon Power and Abound Solar. Thats less than the $2.4 billion Congress has set aside for losses, The New York Times points out. If Romney had that kind of record at Bain Capital, hed be a proud member of the billionaires club right now."
"I know people say that voter ID laws disenfranchise minorities. But I dont understand how? I am genuinely naive on this subject. I grew up really poor. For a while I lived inside a station wagon with my mom. When I turned 18, I went to the DMV and took a test, and they just gave me a license. It really wasnt that hard. They also hand out state IDs there too, if you dont want the privilege of driving. I am not defending any side of this argument, but how is it more difficult for a minority to get an ID? "
"I agree it may be hard to imagine the difficulty getting an id card. But, Texas is a minority-majority state, there are some counties that do not have a DMV. Or the county is so big you might need to travel 100 miles (round trip) to visit the DMV. There are no DMV offices in 81 of 254 counties in Texas. Its mainly due to an amendment introduced by democrats in TX, voters are allowed to sign affidavits instead of being required to submit a provisional ballot. All that aside, lets talk about your questions. First, lets define Voting Rights.

not to mention that Warren Buffetts middle-class secretary pays a much higher effective tax rate than he does. But shes the one getting goodies and giveaways apparently. 
"This is such a stupid statement thats spouted all the time. Sure, Buffetts secretary might be paying a higher rate. But Im sure Buffett has enough cash on hand to be able to go without income for at least a year. He would then pay 0%. Is that somehow a meaningful statistic?"
"Theres actually no way to prove that because the info isnt publicly available. What we *can* evaluate, though, is a similar statement by Barack Obama. He said: &gt;I shouldn?t be paying a lower effective rate than a teacher, or a firefighter, or a construction worker. And they sure shouldn?t be paying a higher tax rate than somebody pulling in $50 million a year. It?s not fair, and it?s not right. And it?s got to change. - &gt; Somebody who?s making $50,000 a year as a teacher shouldn?t be paying a higher effective tax rate than somebody like myself or Jeff [Weiner, CEO of Linkdin], who?ve been incredibly blessed. Unfortunately for the President, he cant make blanked statements like Buffet because his data *is* publicly available! So FactCheck.org ran the numbers, and it turns out Obama [was lying.](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/09/obamas-teacher-tax-whopper/) He didnt pay lower tax rates than a teacher. Or even similar tax rates. Heres the federal income tax rates: Obama: 25.3% (his lowest year.) If Obama were a teacher earning $50k / year: 0%. In fact, he would *receive* a $37 refund while contributing nothing in income taxes. Even when you factor in all federal taxes, Obama still paid 12.4% more than the teacher. (26.5% vs. 14.1%) &gt;Any way we figure it, the $50,000-a-year teacher (or firefighter, or construction worker) paid a lower rate than Obama last year. What?s more, the teacher will pay an even lower overall rate on this year?s income. The ?Making Work Pay? credit has expired, which will push up the effective income tax rate a bit (though still nothing close to Obama?s). But that loss is more than offset by this year?s ?payroll tax holiday,? which has cut the worker portion of Social Security taxes by 2 percentage points ? which is worth $1,000 to workers (including teachers) making $50,000."
So the oracle of Omaha is stupid? Because he made this exact point in a full-time ad in the NY times.
"To whit I reply: But part of the problem is that his secretarys tax bill also went up since a partial payroll tax holiday ended, raising what she pays for social security by 2 percentage points. Ill be a fair amount higher, 8 or 9 points higher, Buffett said of his own tax rate in an appearance on CNBC Monday. But the differential between me and the rest of the office, not just my secretary but the rest of the office, was greater than that. Itll be closer, but Ill probably be the lowest paying taxpayer in the office. -Warren Buffett http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/index.html"

Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was talking about the full gamut of these offenses on Face the Nation on June 9, 2013. **While much of the focus has been on women, Gillibrand emphasized that this is not just a womans issue. More than half of the victims are men.** &gt; &gt; The large disparity between the total number of men who responded in the survey that they had been victims and the relatively small number who sought treatment or made an official complaint is likely due in part to the greater reluctance of men to report unwanted sexual contact."
"Rape is not just a womens issue, especially in the military."
"While true, I think most of the publicized cases have female victims. I hope that changing the way these procedures are handled dramatically increases reporting and prosecutions for male victims, too, though."
"Ted Nugent, cool hard-workin dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces. Im gonna play their own game, and Im gonna destroy em. Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss. Euuuh, i think you lost! But you know the funny thing about it? Id make an incredible army man. Id be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and Id have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin killers youd ever seen in my platoon. But I just wasnt into it. I was too busy doin my own thing, you know? And i could be a millionare, i just dont want to... What a wanker!"
"It was a cool story until he turned into a douche later on. In the 90s this story was told and liberal people loved it, thought he was cool. He deserves to take a lot of flak, but its interesting to see how a shifting perspective changes peoples interpretation. &gt;And i could be a millionare, i just dont want to... The difference is, he actually could, and did. He didnt want to be drafted into a bullshit war and throw away his music career."
"Saying you could do something and be the best, but you dont because you dont want to means you are not the best. He is not and never will be a good colonel, because he rather shits his pants than defend/go to war for his counrty. Evlis had a carreer, he went. "

Bet he has a killer k/d ratio. Army man indeed. What a cunt.
"So, you are *okay* with 11000 gun deaths a year? Nothing to be done? I hope you never have a loved one killed by someone with a gun, but if you do, remember this conversation."
Dont forget that 2/3 of gun deaths are suicides. 
"Of course deaths are not ok. But youre trying to be an alarmist and make a mountain out of a mole hill. Gun deaths didnt even make it in the top ten. Heck, deaths caused by all classifications of violence didnt even make it in that list. So dont pretend that gun violence is an emergency national epidemic. Its tragic, but its not an epidemic. If you werent acting so disingenuously, youd run along to address the real mortality issues. Issues such as heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, Alzheimer, and all other forms of cancer. Those beat out gun deaths by an incredibly wide margin."
"Noted, but well ignore it and give the anti gun loonies another advantage. Even still, they fall far short."
"Lets do the math on this. Itll put the article in proper perspective. The article claims 30 people per day die due to guns. Lets assume that its true for arguments sake. 30 x 365 = 11,000 (rounding up for a clean number and to give the anti gun loonies an advantage). Then we take the population count of this country which is roughly 313,000,000 people (rounding down to again give the anti gun loonies an advantage) So what percentage is the 11k out of the 313 million? 0.004% (rounding up again to give the anti gun loonies an advantage). Really people, even with this sensationalist headline,uncertified claim and giving the anti gun loonies a slight mathematical advantage, it still comes out to 0.004% of the population. "
"Many of the same conservative politicians who consider gun violence in America is too statistically insignificant to bother with, have passed laws to prevent voter fraud, which has claimed exactly zero lives per year. In 2011 alone, 14 states passed new restrictions on the right to vote. To my knowledge, none of these states passed new restrictions on guns. Here are some statistics on the number of voter fraud cases: &amp;nbsp; * [**Iowa: 0.001%**](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/16/iowa-voter-fraud_n_4455110.html) * [**Ohio: 0.0003%**](http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20131218/NEWS010801/312180099/Husted-17-non-citizens-voted-2012-election-Ohio) * [**Minnesota: 0.0003%**](http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2012/08/cases-voter-id-election-fraud-found-virtually-non-existent) * [**Texas: 0.00003%**](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/sep/13/eddie-bernice-johnson/voter-fraud-occurs-texas-though-convictions-and-gu/) &amp;nbsp; Special Mention: **[South Carolina: 0](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-case-of-zombie-voters-in-south-carolina/2013/07/24/86de3c64-f403-11e2-aa2e-4088616498b4_blog.html)** State officials claimed on [Fox News](http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/01/23/report-more-than-900-dead-people-voted-in-south-carolina-elections) that 900 dead people had voted. After a year-long state investigation, the actual number of dead people voting turned out to be **ZERO**. Fox has not retracted or corrected the story. 0 out of 1.3 MILLION South Carolina only made the study public after being forced to by a FOI request from the media. *They went on to pass one of the countrys strictest voter ID laws to prevent dead people from voting.* &amp;nbsp; OK... since like yesterday, Ive dared offer facts in a post about guns, I will expect as usual to be brigaded into obscurity. **Note - due to Reddits gun brigade all comments below here will self destruct.

"Is this an episode of the Twilight Zone where nobody ever said anything about Halliburton? Even for TZ, it just seems far too surreal."
I feel like Im taking crazy pills
"On the contrary, people have been vocal on the Halliburton no-bid contracts thing for years. The only problem is, here on Reddit, in which naive views on capitalistic infallibility/perfection are utterly rampant, every time Ive seen this discussed, the voices of he was FORMER CEO, you idiot, do you know what former means? and, Just because he worked for that company at one time doesnt mean he still has connections to it. and no dude, thats impossible cause its ILLEGAL, man. drown out everyone else. Ive personally been informed of my own idiocy for assuming Cheney would retain business ties to Haliburton after leaving the company. He LEFT man. Do you know what that means? Do you still talk to the people from your first job, bro? Didnt think so. Alright, I added some bros. But you get the point. I agree with your sentiment, but I think its more a matter of opinions being quashed rather than certain brigades being silent."
&gt;literally hundreds of billions Politifact says it was [about $31 billion](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/09/arianna-huffington/halliburton-kbr-and-iraq-war-contracting-history-s/). 
I wasnt silent. Im only half wingnut though.
"Pointing out what Chaney did does not excuse what Feistein has/is doing. Im a California Democrat. We should hold all politicians accountable, not just the guys on the other team. "
"Two non-wrongs make a non-right? One non-wrong and non-right, make a right-wrong? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME IM SO CONFUSED."
"I think youd be naive to believe that a US Senator couldnt exert influence on these transactions. Who knows if she did or didnt, but this should raise a red flag. That said, this may be an overreaction if its shown that this deal was an arms length transaction and that this firm had the same opportunity as any other would have had to sell those properties."
"If i remember correctly, he has a very small stake in the company too. It isnt like he is getting bags full of money from this kind of transaction. "
"Yeah, bro, Reddit never once mentioned Halliburtons oil field service contracts. In fact, I hadnt even heard of Halliburton until your post. Damn /r/politics, you need to be less partisan. You really should talk about Halliburton when Halliburton is doing shady shit. How could you let this slip through the cracks?"
"The company that the husband of an old non-liberal democrat works for gets the contract to sell post offices. His wife, the Senator, who does not sit on any government committee that decides who get the contracts to sell old post offices, has no actual mechanism or overt authority to influence government contracting. The Wing-Nut brigade goes ballistic. Halliburton gets literally hundreds of billions in direct government contracts for a massive, unfinanced war in the middle east presided over by the Vice-President of the country, and former secretary of defense, and former CEO of Halliburton. The Wing-Nut brigade is silent."
"IIRC, silence is about the opposite of what happened when that news broke."

The fact remains that the reason for the attack was an extremely provocative rightwing reactionary conservative fundamentalist Republican youtube video attacking muslims, that went viral on the anniversary of 9/11...which, you will recall, was done by reactionary conservative fundamentalist medieval throwback elements originally sponsored, trained and funded by US rightwing reactionary conservative fundamentalist Republicans, as client terrorists to harass the flanks of Russia and the oil fields, but are now lumbering across the landscape like a zombie Frankenstein monster, running amok. So...yes, Libya, and Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan...are a serious clusterfk, still moar or less driven by the momentum of a sordid legacy. Ima just glad teh Prez is holding his fire, on Iran and Syria, and resorting to diplomacy instead, to some good effect, so far...consistent with the will of the American peoples, I might add, rather than bombing the shit out of them, like McCain et al keep demanding, against the peoples will.

Wait. Ollie North is still relevant? 
"I wonder how he signed up for all those... it would be interesting to receive that sort of stuff and post them online, so theres more of a record of the crazy shit these folks spew. I bet he gave ten bucks here and there to a bunch of tea party orgs and his address got shopped around."
I desperately want to believe this is not true. 
"Theres bans saying people cannot shout fire in a public area because it could/would cause panic. That this is not covered by the 1st amendment. But having national media industries outright lie saying the President is going to ban christianity in the military, that he is a islam worshipping commie who let the muslim brotherhood into the whitehouse and will be the ultimate downfall of Americans is rediculous. Granted I believe the President is doing shitty stuff and open media is 100% needed. But if we cannot shout fire what makes it ok to shout death and destruction to millions. Its basically fear-mongering on made up facts. Now if you have facts to support what you are saying then by all means go with it. "
"This isnt even unusual. My 86-year-old stepfather had a stroke so my mother started opening the many solicitations for money that come from rather mainstream conservatives. Out of the three I read (all arrived on the same day) Alan Wests was the most normal, only accusing Obama of being a Socialist Muslim who hated white people. Oliver Norths said that Obama was a Muslim who had a plan to make it illegal to practice Christianity in the military and destroy our defenses so he can turn the country over to the Arabs. The worst was from some rightwing talk show host whom I had never heard of who said Obama was a Muslim Socialist Communist racist who should be legally dragged out of the White House and hung from a lamppost. The mail was sponsored by World Net Daily. He receives *at least* four pieces of mail like this every single day, usually many more. Every day."
"Wow. This probably explains my uncle. Not so bright, and tons of stuff like this on Facebook."
"No, I think he hid them, or at least he did from my mother. She had no idea how much he spent, but in any case it is his money (they married as older widowed people and have separate finances). Only since the stroke when she took over reading his mail did she realized how much he got."
"There is too much of it to catalog, literally. I assume he got on the lists from being a lifelong Republican donor since before they went crazy. I want to emphasize that many arent fringe people, Ive previously seen appeals to him from Mitch McConnell, Boehner, etc. that are only slightly less over-the-top. Thirty years ago they would have been considered bat shit insane, and now this comes from the leadership of the party. As for the money he gave it aint 10 dollars here and there, its *tens of thousands* of dollars. Most of them start out Dear Mr. X we appreciate your donation of Y dollars. The first one (the West group) he had given $2,000 to alone."
I hope someone somewhere is collecting and saving all these mailers. Years from now our grandchildren will look at them in awe.
"As much as any 86-year-old does. He worked for 30 years. Fortunately he is also well off from investments, etc. and so he isnt spending his rent or food money."
/r/politics is leaking again
"&gt;Oliver Norths said that Obama was a Muslim who had a plan to make it illegal to practice Christianity in the military and destroy our defenses so he can turn the country over to the Arabs. This doesnt even make sense. If youre going to give the US to the Arabs, you do it by gradually converting the Christians into Muslims and you do it while preserving the strength of the military so that you can use it to convert the rest of the world. If you do it the way described by North then you create an underground religious militia strong enough to resist anything the Arabs can send over. "
"What I dont get about these allegations that the wing nuts keep making: were like 6 years into his presidency now. It seems like if this was his master plan, to attack Christianity, he would have at least started by now. But.....nothing. So, what do they think hes waiting for?"
How much a month does your stepfather collect in Social Security and Medicare? 
"Oliver North, Americas most trusted former political leader. Its okay if he commits treason I guess, as long as it was under Reagan."
Does he hoard them? AMA?
When I hear hanging and Obama in the same sentence I think its pretty safe to say the person making the comment is racist or at the very least racially insensitive. And its always hanging as the method for these people never firing squad or electric chair or any of the numerous methods of execution. Always hanging... it makes me cringe.

"Lets expand on that a bit: he **intentionally** blew the cover of an under cover CIA operative, who was working to **prevent Iran from getting nukes**, both endangering her life, her contacts, and destroying all the work she had built up over years, so that he could get payback against her husband, for being a whistle-blower against their **knowingly-false** claims to the public that Saddam was trying to get nuke material, in an attempt to start a war with Iraq, where a company he had millions in stock options would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of said war. The hubris is overflowing. Update: Factcheck says that Cheney assigned his stock options to a trust to benefit 3 charities of his choosing before he took office."
what company was it?

"IIRC Armitage was the primary source for one of the articles, but had no knowledge of Plames undercover status, and was not outing anyone intentionally. Cheneys chief of staff Libby on the other hand, intentionally discussed Plame with multiple reporters, including Judith Miller and Matt Cooper, to pave the way for an attack on Joe Wilsons credibility by claiming that Plame arranged for the trip as a vacation for her husband and other nonsense that might stick. Libby avoided prosecution on the leak by technicality because Armitage had already independently leaked the information first, but of course he was convicted of felony obstruction/perjury etc."
I am literally gritting my teeth right now...
Search google for Valerie Plame and Scooter Libby (Cheneys chief of staff) or their Wikipedia entries.

So I guess I hope they enjoy it."
"None of the bosses (Im one of them) is getting a raise either, and with sharp increases in our healthcare premiums, were effectively getting a pay cut. As far as someone high up, like the CEO, taking a pay cut, you have ABSOLUTELY no idea of the scale of the direct labor budget for a corporation and no idea what you are talking about. We have about 300 minimum wage employees per plant (varies seasonally). We have 3 plants in NJ. A 40-hour week equals 2080 hours per year per person. so 900 x $1 x 2080 hours = 1.872 MILLION DOLLARS.

Ive lived in 4 different countries and had to pay for an ID in all of them... Sure would be nice if they were free but the most common forms of ID - passports and drivers licences arent free anywhere as far as I know. Even the new ID card system in the UK is not free - [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_Cards_Act_2006#Costs).
"I dont drive but I have a provisional drivers licence that works as an ID, all I had to do for that was pass the theory test which was incredibly easy compared to my home country. Im a legal immigrant so I cant vote anyway but the process of getting an ID in USA was simple. &gt;Keep in mind that no one is saying that voter ID laws make it impossible for most people to vote. Instead, the laws suppress the turnout of certain groups by making voting inconvenient for them. These groups (women, the poor, etc) tend to vote Democratic, which makes the whole thing somewhat suspicious. To be honest if someone cant be bothered with something simple like getting an ID to vote can they be bothered to even research the candidates/laws that are being voted on? I think voting is a serious thing which shouldnt be approached lightly. We recently had a voting here in CO and even though I cant vote I did a lot of research about the proposed new laws. &gt;Of course, the other thing to remember is that these laws are combating a non-existent problem. [Other sources say otherwise](http://www.truethevote.org/news/the-reality-of-voter-fraud), also why talk about evil Republicans when the Democrats do plenty of shady stuff as well? Neither party is trustworthy in my opinion. All in all I think requiring a current ID in order to vote is a very basic thing that most countries do, there is absolutely nothing outrageous about it. "
[deleted]
I never had a free ID and Ive lived in 4...
"Having a legal ID in order to vote seems to be an extremely basic thing... most countries require it. You cant just wander into a poll and vote, you may not be in the country legally, be a genuine voter etc. "
How many of those countries give free IDs to every citizen and have a national holiday on election day?
"The difference is that most countries have a national ID, and no such thing exists in the US. Getting an ID can actually be fairly difficult, especially if one doesnt drive, doesnt live close to a DMV, or cant make it to the DMV during the (sometimes extremely limited) open hours. Plus, as the link says, even having an ID isnt always enough. In Texas, for example, it needs to show your current name, which is often not the case on married womens drivers licenses. The net result is that **34% of voting-age women do not have the required ID**--which shows that it is definitely not a basic thing that everyone has. Keep in mind that no one is saying that voter ID laws make it impossible for most people to vote. Instead, the laws suppress the turnout of certain groups by making voting inconvenient for them. These groups (women, the poor, etc) tend to vote Democratic, which makes the whole thing somewhat suspicious. Especially when Republican politicians have out-and-out stated that the purpose of voter ID laws is to [win elections for Republicans](http://www.post-gazette.com/state/2012/06/26/Turzai-s-voter-ID-remark-draws-criticism/stories/201206260143). Of course, the other thing to remember is that these laws are combating a [non-existent problem](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/sep/19/naacp/-person-voter-fraud-very-rare-phenomenon/). **TL;DR: Voter ID laws have no real benefit and suppress turnout in a partisan way.**"
how many poor and uneducated people have you adopted lately? i imagine your success ratio for saving the poor and uneducated from a life of GOP hating and raping must be very fulfilling. why dont you share some storys and pictures of you and your extended progressive educated adopted family
"their aid? like anyone has a right to something that is gifted to them? their aid is what is making them fat, stupid and complacent. who you going to blame for this segment of the obese retarded lazy voting populace? at least they can get free birth control"

Its not unlabeled. Read the [snopes article](http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/aspartamemilk.asp) about it.
"I know, I was just making a general statement. In general, I dont want anything in my food that I dont know about."
"While I dont buy into the anti-aspartame hysteria, I definitely dont like hidden, unlabeled additives in my food."
"how so? dont hospitals make money when people go to them? besides a couple more preventative care visits (which are rather inexpensive), how are hospitals making more money?"
because they dont have to cover random dude strolling through the er with their bonus checks...
"i was asking an honest question, as im not sure if hospitals benefit a whole lot from the ACA (not like the insurance companies do). but there is no way of knowing if premiums are up until after 3/31 when the real deadline to sign up is. premiums go up every year and from what i have read and seen, the raise in premiums has slowed down. it makes sense that health care costs go up though, as demand is increasing"
"People keep making the argument that preventative care lowers healthcare costs by preventing catastrophic illnesses, but I think that?s only actually true for a few types of preventative care. Some preventative care measures prevent illness that is rare enough that it actually raises costs to screen a bunch of people for the illness instead of waiting for the illness to arise: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money/"
its true for some people. but the most basic preventative care that nearly everyone takes advantage of is the annual or semi-annual checkup where you piss into a cup and do a blood test. those 2 tests can catch a lot of catastrophic illnesses before they are serious and save a lot of future costs. same goes for tests like prostate exams and mammograms when you are older.
"The cost of services themselves arent being affected so much as the cost of insurance. What that means is more people will (hopefully) be able to afford care easier, but the hospitals will still get the same amount per service themselves. Aside more people can afford care, more will GO for care. More customers at the same old rates equals more money for the hospital. "
"&gt; Those costs have prompted financially strapped hospitals to rely on a complex system of shifting costs. Most of the burden falls on taxpayers, with the government providing tens of billions of dollars annually to help hospitals care for the uninsured. Privately insured Americans also pay a price as insurers raise premiums to reflect higher charges from hospitals. doesnt sound like the hospital covers much of, if at all, the cost of covering uninsured people who stroll through the ER [source](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/18/nation/la-na-emergency-care-20120619/2)"
&gt; dont hospitals make money when people go to them? premiums went up as well as health care costs.pay attention to something other than John Stewart.
"premiums go up every year. ACA is actually slowing down the increases in many places. http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-health-care-laws-success-story-slowing-down-medical-costs/2013/11/08/e08cc52a-47c1-11e3-b6f8-3782ff6cb769_story.html http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-will-health-costs-continue-slowing/2014/01/08/c79a7c3e-7885-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/08/20/2498391/growth-in-health-care-costs-continues-to-decrease-since-passage-of-obamacare/ also, premiums are going up because people are getting a higher quality product. prices will ultimately go down in the long-run. compare it to getting regular maintenance on your car. yeah, you have to drop some dough every year, but your avoiding the huge costs in the long run (surgery, cancer, etc.)."
how are people getting a worse product? plans that were already up to standards didnt change. the ones that werent got better.
Premiums were going down until the ACA passed and then they started skyrocketing after passage and now are slowing down again. With the low turnout of youth it is highly possible they will go up again a significant amount again next year. http://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2011/10/premium-growth.png http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottgottlieb/2013/10/28/obamacare-faces-a-death-spiral-but-it-turns-on-the-declining-participation-of-health-plans-and-not-just-their-rising-premiums/ Some people are getting a better product some people worse. 
"&gt; It doesnt solve any other problem. you simply making that system doesnt change the fact that the ACA provides insurance to people who couldnt get it or afford it before. just b/c you are pointing out silly problems that it solves doesnt mean the ACA is pointless. it solves problems. you are choosing to ignore them or deflect from them. &gt; Sadly, thats not true either. Yet, another problem not solved by forcing people to buy comprehensive community rated insurance. nice right-winged source right there. how about these sources: http://www.cnbc.com/id/100840148 http://www.today.com/money/biggest-cause-personal-bankruptcy-medical-bills-6C10442408 http://www.clearbankruptcy.com/financial-literacy/10-leading-causes-of-bankruptcy.aspx http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/05/bankruptcy.medical.bills/ &gt; Sadly, that isnt true. oh, ok. ill take your word for it. think of this like a car. what costs less in the long run? getting annual, routine maintenance every year where no major problems come up in 10 years? or getting no maintenance at all and having to replace a major part of the car every 3-5 years? &gt; Further, a doctor visit already is cheap for that sort of thing. you would think that about cars too right? oil changes and tire rotations are cheap. but they dont do it. in terms of health insurance, it costs everyone when people dont do it. make it free and people will do it which brings down the cost for everyone. &gt; Do you know who has one of the best healthcare systems in the world? Singapore. in singapore, the govt requires you to contribute a certain % of income. then the govt provides a safety net for everything that the personal savings cant cover (includes both catastrophic and non-catastrophic). also, everyone pretty much still has private insurance. but its the public form that drives healthcare coverage. [more info here from a conservative friend of yours](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/28/conservatives-love-obamacare-when-it-s-singaporecare.html) but guess who else has some of the most efficient health care: hong kong, japan, israel, spain, italy, australia, switzerland, sweeden. and guess what? they all have govt run healthcare systems. so again i ask, what do they know about healthcare that we dont. for every system like singapore, there are 10 govt run systems that work just as well, if not better..."
[well here is the republican plan from Sen. John Chafee in 1993](http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2010/february/23/gop-1993-health-reform-bill.aspx). looks pretty similar to the PPACA
"Gee, I wonder why the Republican Party didnt put forth more of an effort to debate it? And I wonder if youd find that the co-sponsors of that bill were all RINOs anyways. Chuck Grassley? Richard Lugar? Not exactly conservative stalwarts, eh? Even [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/15/ellen-qualls/aca-gop-health-care-plan-1993/) had problems twisting this into a true comparison: &gt;However, to call it the Republican plan, as though a majority of Republicans endorsed it, goes too far. The House Republicans took a different path, and there was opposition from more hard-line members of the Republican coalition. It is telling that the Chafee bill never became a full blown bill and never came up for a vote. Nice try. "

What part of Patsy do you not understand? He was probably told what he presented was the truth. Keep in mind that Powell had been out of any type of intelligence loop for years prior to his time as Secretary of State. Only later did he find out what he was given to present was bullshit. 
:/ I expect leaders to have some moral conviction not to lead us into a war on false pretenses against a regime who posed no threat to anybody.
I expect Powell was forcibly manipulated... He was an upright man for a long time before the Bush fiasco.
It SEEMS possible that Powell played along with Cheneys BS because he thought he could do more good from the inside than resigning in disgust - but it DOES seem like he got played.
"Yeah. Youre right, those evil Republican must have just tricked all of these people: http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/wmdquotes.asp It is beyond absurd to say that the regime of Saddam Hussein posed no threat to anybody. At the very least he posed a threat to his own people, not only from direct persecution and torture of perceived dissidents, but also from forcing the UN to apply sanctions on the country, which was hurting the populace far more than it was hurting Saddam and his inner circle. Thats to say nothing of the potential actions that Saddam himself could have inflicted on his neighboring countries as his situation grew more desperate, with or without WMDs (and there is some evidence he was pursuing them, even if he didnt have any at the time). On top of that, the potential turmoil caused by a collapse of Saddams regime was a very real threat to the entire area as Iraq stands between a lot of countries who genuinely hate each other (before even factoring Israel into the mix). Reasonable people can disagree on whether war was the correct action. And only the most blind Neo-Con loyalists will say that the execution of the war has been anything other than horribly inept. But to say that the regime posed no threat to anyone is simply idiotically ahistorical.

"First off, dont use yall to lump me in with any particular group. Second, from factcheck.org A majority of federal spending is exempt from the sequester cuts, so the parts that are not will be cut much more deeply than that. For example, defense spending (other than for military personnel) will be cut by 8 percent across the board, and nondefense discretionary spending will be cut by between 5 percent and 6 percent. So defense spending was cut the hardest, most of the government is exempt, and those that arent are cut by 5 - 6 %. How is this so horrible? "

Off topic but Im actually interested in seeing a comparison of the rates of reported cancer in both countries 
[This](http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/ssabullets.asp) was largely debunked by all fact checking sites. Most experts think any ammo shortages are actually caused by people thinking like you and going out and buying all available stock up.
"They only bought (yet as far as I know, havent received), .40. That doesnt explain why all .22, 9mm, .40, .45, .223, 7.62x39, etc are not in stock, that lies in with the potential bans that were going through the house/senate, and they just finally started to catch up. This is just going to make the supply dwindle again. "
&gt; Most experts think any ammo shortages are actually caused by people thinking like you and going out and buying all available stock up. I have no need for ammo as I find most current hand held weaponry to be outdated and inefficient. But thanks for the assumption on my purchasing habits and paranoia.
"Ive seen a few professional and many non-professional people discuss this. If I can average the collective opinions and arguments made that Ive seen into the most likely cause, average citizens buying all they can. A couple that Ive read go into pretty good detail about how they came to that conclusion. Citing the publicly available numbers from various government agencies and it seems to average that they bought 1,000-1,500 rounds per agent that has a firearm per year. Which is close to their normal purchasing amounts. Sure there is speculation about purchases off the books or at least kept secret from public documents, but the lack of ammo still heavily points towards citizens buying them all. Personally, I know several people that make their weekly rounds to places that sell ammo and buy pretty much as much as they can every time. And they are regularly saying that shelves are bare, or at least the caliber they are looking for. In my preferred caliber, Ive not been able to purchase any in a good 3 months or more. Shelves are just bare, Ive seen a few here and there but for other calibers. I could order online some fancy ones that are $1+ per round, I choose not to spend that much. "
I thought that ammo was scarce because the federal government (TSA) bought up a huge amount of the US ammo supply and the market has yet to be able to recover. A short while ago people were concerned that they were purchasing so much ammo and I think this may have been the ultimate goal of that. No one seems to care anymore about that they have these huge ammo stockpiles.

Look, Ive already pointed out that said promise needs to be put in the context of Obama pushing a Universal Health Care law that was grossly different than the one that got passed. He was making that pledge before he was even the official nominee, for Petes sake. **Of course** we have to take into account the reality of the widespread opposition to his plan and how that shaped the final ACA bill. But to attempt to reframe the campaign promise or act like its taken out of context is just ridiculous and revisionist. "
"Ok youre talking about a different save 2500 quote than Im familiar with. As you say, that quote was way back when he was a nominee, talking about a much different plan than the ultimate ACA. Also its very possible Obama misspoke during that debate. Im having trouble finding details on exactly what this catastrophic reinsurance plan consists of, but the closest I could find was [this document](http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/politics/factsheet_healthcare.pdf) which again states Under the Obama plan, the typical family will save up to $2,500 every year with no mention of average. The quote Im familiar with people citing is detailed here http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/521/cut-cost-typical-familys-health-insurance-premium-/ ... and again the quote says cut the cost of a typical familys premium by **up to** $2,500 a year (emphasis mine). That quote from the democratic primary debate seems like the anomaly."
"Ted Nugent is a hero to many for being patriotic, and yet he was a coward when it came time to serve. Thats the story with a lot of people. They claim to be patriotic but when it comes down to help their country they just turn around and go the opposite way. I have serve with some of the best Marines Ive ever met. Many of them were resident aliens with a green card. They where the most patriotic. Some became Naturalized while many didnt. Now Im at a trade school and I hear the same shit I was going to but _______. ( Insert random excuse). "
Refusing a draft != not serving your country. A war that requires conscription to prosecute it does not deserve to be held up as a measure of patriotism.
"I believe our nation is great because its a volunteer army. I wouldnt want to be pushed around and treated like shit, because my government tells me too. as much respect I have for all service members, Fuck that shit it aint for me "
Has it occurred to anyone that you can love your country while despising its draft policies? 
ITT: [Ad Hominem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem)
"Feelings about the nuge aside, **FUCK ANYONE** that says draft dodging is cowardly."
The talentless fucktard was suppose to leave if Obama got re-elected? His word is as shitty as his music.
"Oh, you mean during Vietnam? Yes, Id certainly call killing impoverished people thousands of miles away serving your country. I dont give a good god damn what you think of Ted Nugent, but claiming that people are cowards for refusing to let their government ship them to foreign lands to die for geopolitical bullshit is, in itself, bullshit, and goes against everything Ive ever been told by people who actually served their. You want to make a point about how insane a conservative nut who has threatened the life of the president is? Dont do it by making the assertion that anyone who does not wish do die at the hands of ignorant and corrupt politicians is a coward."
"This is such a ridiculously stupid argument. I see nothing wrong with being a draft dodger. Vietnam was not an ethical military action. Also, not having served doesnt mean you cant have an opinion on soldier suicides. Being a daft dodger wouldnt mean you cant care about soldiers. Edit: its not like it hard to show how much I an idiot Ted Nugent is without making fallacious arguments. "
"Still waiting for Nugent to commit suicide because of Obama...come on Ted, any day now"
Ted Nugent is an embarrassment to the Great State of Michigan.
&gt;Veterans ... return home ... living with the knowledge their sacrifice was predicated on a vicious lie. The lie was uncovered long ago. Most of them knew when they signed up that their service was predicated on a lie.
"So the guy thought the war Vietnam was evil and immoral and did everything he could to avoid becoming a military slave to fight in said evil war. Couple of decades later, he believes the current wars that the US are engaged in now are also are evil and immoral. And he further believes because soldiers are permanently physically and mental scared because of these war many of them turn to suicide as a way to end their pain. "
"Arent you supposed to be dead or in jail, Ted? "
...beats PTSD any day.
"I wouldnt say this makes Ted Nugent a coward. I hate war, I would never join the army unless there was a direct threat of invasion to my country, does that make me a coward? The only thing you can accuse him of is hypocrisy - Im not sure which is worse. "
[85% of soldiers who commit suicide have never seen combat.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/foreign-affairs-defense/why-soldiers-keep-losing-to-suicide/)
http://www.politicususa.com/ted-nugent-cowardly-serve-blames-obama-veterans-suicides.html Ted Nugent Was Too Cowardly to Serve But He Blames Obama For Veterans Suicides: Nugent has never had to experience actively hunting and killing another human being because when he was called to serve he urinated and defecated in his pants for a week to avoid serving the nation he claims to love. 
"Come on guys you can do better than this. Ted Nugent is a distraction, lets talk about wealth inequality."
"As a conservative, with a father who is a Tea Party Conservative, very few people give a fuck about what Ted Nugent has to say. My dad always told me he was a phony and ignorant piece of shit and from what I can tell hes right. Dont even give this fool the time of day. "
I dont really get the title. Why would it be necessary to server in an army to be qualified to criticize policies set in place by current administration? 
Shouldnt this guy be dead or in prison by now? Do the world a favor Ted and live by your own words.
"Too cowardly to serve? Give me a fucking break. It was Vietnam, an absolute bullshit maneuver that will forever mar American history. We werent defending ourselves, we were raining wholesale destruction on Vietnam and causing it to spill into Cambodia. Refusing to participate in the military industrial complex is exactly what President Eisenhower warned our oblivious grandparents to do. They failed our country, and so did our apparently equally blind parents. Ted Nugent doesnt need to go to war to tell you how fucking stupid it is for America to continue waging them. EDIT: Many of you make very excellent points. However, I think some of you might mistake my issue with the glorification of serving in Vietnam as defending the immense douche that is the Nuge. I understand many of you have relatives that risked their lives in Vietnam, and did so honorably, but it was a phony cause with terrible ramifications for innocent people, that is why the war effort fell apart after all. Rather than thanking these men for being taken advantage of, we should apologize for forcing them to participate in such a horrific waste of human life and potential. Not be fucking Gung-ho about it. Ted Nugent is pointing out that the troops get fucked over and forgotten, and presently they are killing themselves at a high rate. Regardless of Ted Nugents hypocrisy, hes not wrong in this instance, hes just an asshole."
 I couldnt have said it better myself!!! Chenney and romney too......pussies!!
"This man embarrasses most legitimate 2nd amendment advocates and indeed, most Americans."
"Im not going to call any draft resister a coward, no matter how they managed to get out of the military, even Ted Nugent. Nor can I argue with the fact that the military is causing suicides, and that the commander in chief, while not entirely responsible, is obliged to create a solution. That being said I cant stand Ted, and as little support I have for the president, it is just moronic when people blame him for something that isnt really his fault. The only reason they do this is because to come to terms with the reason why everything sucks right now is to betray their own ethos."
"Im no fan of Nugent, but why is his claim damaged by his refusal to go to war, rather than the fact that its probably not true? If I avoided the draft for Vietnam, would I have forfeited my right to say hey, LBJ, conditions over there are pretty bad?"
This subject is number one on project censoreds list about subjects that media dont want to talk about. [1. More US Soldiers Committed Suicide Than Died in Combat](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/1-more-us-soldiers-committed-suicide-than-died-in-combat/) 
"Nugent sucks, so does this blog."
Being a soldier does not serve the countrys interests. It serves the leaders interests. 
Dont forget about the crystal meth he claims to have done to help him fail. The irony of his act compared to this interview speaks volumes.
This is out and out *ad hominem*. 
"Like Cheney, hes a Chicken Hawk. Heres some others: http://www.awolbush.com/whoserved.html"
"Im no fan of Nugent, but you can love your country and be against conscription. Especially when its used like the USA has used it."
"Its projection. People like Nugent and Limbaugh - who both refused to serve in Vietnam and now support all these needless wars in the ME - know theyre complete and utter cowards. Theyre ashamed and feel the need to make up for it, particularly by seeming all macho and shit, like Nugent does with his tough-guy attitude and his scary-looking guns. So they project these feelings onto Obama, a guy who never served at all in the military (much less chickened out and dodged a draft), and call HIM the coward. To me, you lose the right to say we should go to war the second you dodge a draft. You also lose the right to call yourself a patriot who loves his country when you threaten to leave it if the democratically-elected leader you dont like gets into office. You had the chance to fight for your country and blew it, so accept that youre a goddamn pussy and just stop being an asshole."
"Ted Nugent, Hero Patriot. From *High Times* magazine, October 1977. High Times: How did you get out of the draft? Ted Nugent: Ted was a young boy, appearing to be a hippie but quite opposite in fact, working hard and playing hard, playing rock and roll like a deviant. People would question my sanity, I played so much. So I got my notice to be in the draft. Do you think I was gonna lay down my guitar and go play army? Give me a break! I was busy doin it to it. I had a career Jack. If I was walkin around, hippying down, getting loaded and pickin my ass like your common curs, Id say Hey yeah, go in the army. Beats the poop out of scuffin around in the gutters. But I wasnt a gutter dog. I was a hard workin, motherfuckin rock and roll musician. I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and Id drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up. See, I approached the whole thing like, Ted Nugent, cool hard-workin dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces. Im gonna play their own game, and Im gonna destroy em. Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss. I was ill. And three or four days before, I started stayin awake. I was close to death, but I was in control. I was extremely antidrug as Ive always been, but I snorted some crystal methedrine. Talk about one wounded motherfucker. A guy put up four lines, and it was for all four of us, but I didnt know and Im vacuuming that poop right up. I was a walking, talking hunk of human poop. I was six-foot-three of sin. So the guys took me down to the physical, and my nerves, my emotions were distraught. I was not a good person. I was wounded. But as painful and nauseous as it was -- cause I was really into bein clean and on the ball -- I made gutter swine hippies look like football players. I was deviano. So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldnt believe the smell. They were ridiculin me and pushin me around and I was cryin, but all the time I was laughin to myself. When they stuck the needle in my arm for the blood test I passed out, and when I came to they were kicking me into the wall. Then they made everybody take off their pants, and I did, and this sergeant says, Oh my God, put those back on! You fuckin swine you! Then they had a urine test and I couldnt piss, But my poop was just like ooze, man, so I poop in the cup and put it on the counter. I had poop on my hand and my arm. The guy almost puked. I was so proud. I knew I had these chumps beat. The last thing I remember was wakin up in the ear test booth and they were sweepin up. So I went home and cleaned up. They took a putty knife to me. I got the street rats out of my hair, ate some good steaks, beans, potatoes, cottage cheese, milk. A couple of days and I was ready to kick ass. And in the mail I got this big juicy 4-F. Theyd call dead people before theyd call my ass. But you know the funny thing about it? Id make an incredible army man. Id be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and Id have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin killers youd ever seen in my platoon. But I just wasnt into it. I was too busy doin my own thing, you know? "
so this is what were upvoting today? excuse me while I unsubscribe.
"I would do that to avoid the draft too. A nation that would sacrifice freedom for the sake of security deserves neither. All that said, Ted Nugent is still douche. Hes not a douche because hes a draft dodger though, hes a douche for lots of other reasons."
"I hate how politics are on the front page of reddit. Stupid two party system, always pointing fingers at the other. "
Wasnt this bloviating fuckbag supposed to be dead or in jail by now?
Now he makes a living urinating and defecating out of his mouth on stage.
Why does anyone care what a washed-up has-been guitarist from the 70s thinks or says about anything?
"Fuck you, Ted Nugent"
"Sometimes I feel like the only person who recognized that military service and patriotism arent the same thing, and that the draft was pretty horrible and shouldnt have existed in the first place. I dont really care if someone dodged it or not, the same way I dont care if people smoke weed or not. As long as the person who dodged the draft isnt advocating the use of said draft, or otherwise indicating a distaste for draft dodgers, then who cares?"
I like how the title for this post remains impartial.
How does shitting ones pants for a week let you not serve the army?
ted nugent is a world class asshole.
 If he did not believe in the war he should have gone CO status. Crapping his pants is disgusting and low life. That is who he is. He craps on the airwaves every chance he gets.
Having Ted represent arms bearing soldiers is like having Hannibal Lecter represent vegans
"Whatever the case, more could be being done to help combat vets."
"Nugent constantly reminds of an very well known poverb/saying he who speaks the most, says the least I have a friend who finished with the Canadian Forces as a Warrant Officer. As he says it Ive heard tons of shit of how so and so would be awesome in the Army. How theyd be the meanest, hardest killers. Theyd lead their men to hell and back, if they were in. But their not, are they. Theyre at home, drinking every night and sleeping in every morning. Being a soldier isnt about death, killing or war; its about service. Helping your fellow soldier stay the fuck alive, its not fucking easy and no one notices your effort. Ever. Celebrities get praises for every fucking thing they do, soldiers just keep working. Thats why Muhammad Ali didnt join, thats why all these hollywood pricks dont join. Its hard, and no one notices. He lost 7 soldiers under his watch in Afgan, in his career. None of which are famous, none of which will have statues in their names. Yet Ted Nugent gets to act like he knows anything about service. What a tosser"
As a Marine that served thru the afghan and iraq wars....there is nothing cowardly about fighting to avoid participating in a senseless war that we should never have been in.
His music reflects a week long festival of shitting and pissing himself
"I always assumed that was why he was such a hyper-patriot now: horrified shame at what he did, and disgust with himself."

Is anyone else bothered that the link to the source of this claim in the article is very broken? Does anyone have a source?
Against war. Criticises a man for avoiding going to war.

I would do the same. Screw getting killed in a pointless war. Sending teenagers and young men to slaughter for what?
"Ill share a little experience a friend of mine had. He was on protection detail for some of the celebrities that came through Iraq, and as part of their briefing to the the teams coming through, they have to tell them where the hot spots are, including potential roadside attacks, etc. After this briefing, Nugent and his people refused to leave the base they flew into. Anderson Cooper, on the other hand, wanted to go straight into the hottest spots they would let him."
"...Actively hunting and killing another human being. Dude, you have a mental issue."
How is not wanting to get shot at or blown up cowardly? I think its pretty damn smart. 
"Teds a really talented and moral guy. Also, ponies can fly."
"If we could just somehow make people understand that the guy who wrote Wango Tango has simplistic and ignorant political views, we could really make a difference! - you guys "
If everyone avoided the draft the world would be in peace.
"Nugent is a redneck ass. Hes had a single song that anyone has ever heard of, and even that is a piece of shit. Fuck that guy."
I have a resolve: We will respect them for their job when they let others do theirs. 
I never get tired of seeing this reposted! Upvote!
The 70s were really rough on some people...
"You mean the rational, calling out the bullshit, non-ideologically based circle jerk that is /r/politics continues?"
"And the liberal circle jerk that is /r/politics continues... Edit: Fine, Ill give my opinion. Whether or not Ted Nugent is a coward has no bearing on his opinion on Barack Obamas responsibility in his role as President to help stem soldiers suicides. Barack Obama is partially responsible, in his role as President, for the suicides of soldiers because among other reasons he oversees Veterans Administration hospitals which are basically giving a big fuck you to soldiers. Its the same story that it ever was."
"Piers Morgan was also a Brit who lied about his own countrys involvement in Iraq, knowing retribution attacks against English troops for his *faked* information would happen. He then fled to America, and is widely disliked in both countries. My point is, people on both sides of the aisle can be shitheads. Though, Stranglehold is a fucking great song. Nugent should stick to music, and leave the pro-2nd Amendment stuff to others."

No offense to Canada but I thought he was from Canada.

nothing will be done by anyone. 
"Oh come on, shut the fuck up. The vietnam war was not a war in the nations interest, it was all the way on the other side of the world, and we were not allowed to do what it took to win it, so many soldiers died.

"An article full of moronic vitriol without any substance or objectivity. Another gem, Reddit."
"The fact that Nugent didnt serve, while making him a hypocrite in some ways, has absolute fuck-nothing to do with his criticisms of this administrations handling of veterans mental health."
Avoiding serving in the genocide of Vietnamese is nothing but a good thing. 
I really dont think he did that to avoid the draft: http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/nugent.asp
"Criticizing someone for not going to Vietnam to kill asian people who have done nothing to you is kinda ridiculous. If more people refused to fight (or found a way around it), there would be less war. Im sure you all love Obama and war and hate gun rights on this thread, so Im probably talking to deaf ears, but listen kids - war is bad and is best avoided."
Ted Nugent is an asshole.
The fact that you bash nugent for blaming Obama and then turn around and do the same thing he did by blaming it on the republicians is funny to me. When you understand that it is our Government as a whole that has sent our troops to a strange country to get killed over money and power then you will be qualified to write an article. Look at other countries and how the leaders get into physical altercations over what they are trying to do or get passed. Then look at our scumbags in suits voting themselves raises and making themselves exempt from crap healthcare. We have become Rome we just need a gladiator show on occasion to make us happy. 
"I wish I still had my bot running. It would rack up a shitload of karma just reposing comments from the other 100 time this same story has been posted. You all have been trolled by me reddit bots thousands of times, and even up-voted them. I should release the source code on github, but I am afraid that /r/politics would never notice."
"Nugent is a reactionary dunce, but hes right to get out of military service for the USA. Why should he be part of USAs genocidal imperialism? Kind of hypocritical of liberals to get all jingoistic and patriotic in this case."
Good guitar player but its hard to deny that hes a hypocrite. 
"The Chickenshit, Chickenhawk Pants-Shitter, Keyboard Kommando Koward Draft-Dodging TeaBag Child Rapist needs to stand by his word. Why isnt he dead or in jail yet? Maybe he can go for a Pay-Per-View event: Sean Hannity gets waterboarded for the troops while Ted Nugent sucks on his machine gun for the good of humanity. If hes serious hell auction off the rights to man the trigger."
Why should he have gone to Vietnam?
"Not trying to defend Ted, but was Vietnam really serving the nation?"
"Actively hunting and killing another human being?for some megacorporate oligarchs profit, no less?is not my idea of serving the United States. Find something better to criticize him for. If hes as evil as this article is supposed to imply, Im sure youll have no trouble."
Or he didnt believe in the Vietnam war.
Turd Nugget
"THIS gets left in r/politics, but many great articles about income disparity, political corruption, and the abject failures of government agencies get bumped/booted to r/POLITIC? What gives?"
"Ted is an idiot. He, and the people like him, (and this is not limited to one political party...it goes both ways) spout off and run their mouth about the other side and thing theyre being patriotic or blazing a trail or something. What they fail to realize that what they are doing is the exact reason our country is in the state its in. A conservative president/senate/house isnt going to solve our problems. Just like a liberal president/senate/house isnt gong to solve our problems. Whats going to solve our problems is the people washington to acting like adults and working with one another, and leaving their political parties at the door. Worry about whats best for the country, and not just your particular party/constituents. It also wouldnt hurt for people like Ted to shut their yappers. If he can do it better, then run for office. Edit: Grammar/Typos...got a little carried away"
[EDIT] Does anyone here ACTUALLY believe that the military is in place to protect and serve our nation?? 
"Does refusing to serve on principle make you cowardly? If so, count me in. Fuck war. Fuck that shit."
"As far as im concerned, OP is a jackass.. AND, Ted Nugent was saving himself from being turned into the tyrant, warmonger type of person the military brain washes all of its recruits into. I guarantee Ted would have been front row for the civil war! "
"Pretty sure Ted Nugent has probably hunted a human being at some point, given he is both rich and a maniac. I am sure they were helpless and unable to defend themselves, though, unlike in most actual combat situations."
"This is a bad idea to post in politics but. My friend who is a marine, going into recon, said killing feels bad at first, you ended a life in a split second, but after a while, seeing your buddys get shot, killed, blown apart, whatever. It feels right, your doing this for you, your family, someone elses family, your country, your friends. I once saw a man take 2, 12 gauge buckshot rounds to the chest, and i didnt think nothing of it. I slept great that night because it was him, not one of us. "
"I neither know nor care whom this this Ted Nugent idiot is. That said, I must say; your title is very obviously negative therefore making me doubt the veracity of your claims. Indubitably."
It wasnt interesting the first 5 times this story was posted...
Is it bad that when I read this all I could think of was the Always Sunny episode Man Hunters.
I love this country. No way in hell would I ever serve in the military to defend it. 
So its cowardly not to serve when you are drafted? Seems quite ad hominem to me also &gt;urinated and defecated in his pants really ....?
"Sorry to break it to some of you, but going to kill 3rd world peasants in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan does not mean that you dont love your country. All it means is that you dont feel like shooting 3rd world peasants in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan for some random politicians. The pentagon spends BILLIONS each year on promoting the virtue of being a soldier and serving, but maybe you should think about it a bit more and determine for yourself whether you are helping or hurting, and who you are actually serving. "
Someone should read the results of [this study](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/articles/rogers-political-extremism-psychological-science) to Ted Nugent.
"While he is wrong, that is a terrible attack on him. Why should people be unable to comment on things they have never done? Ive never been president so does that mean I shouldnt be able to comment on how the president is doing his job?"
I think shitting your pants is a symptom of cat scratch fever.
"Liberals are mad that Kerry tried to get out of the draft and wasnt half as smart about it as Nugent was, and thus failed. "
"I know Ted Nugent isnt the best and brightest of folks and that his opinions are often stupid. However, I am not one to continually bring up and chastise someone because they were an asshole when they were 18. People change, thats life. That, and Stranglehold is goddamn badass."
Yeah who is Ted to call out Obama? How can he be patriotic and anti-war at the same time?
"Some random person is bad, therefore Obama is good? Look, Im fairly neutral on both Obama and Ted Nugent, but the logic of this article is seriously flawed. "
I dont understand why anyone cares what a draft dodging chicken hawk pussy has to say about anything
But if he dodged the Vietnam draft and supported Obama hed be a hero for following his conscience &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
I take it everyone here is against the 2nd amendment?
"So you need to have participated in the worst side of humanity to have an opinion? I believe your argument is flawed. Fuck war, and fuck out of touch conservatives equally."
Fuck Ted Nugent.
Ad hominem. 
Im one Ted Nugent front page from unfollowing r/politics. 
"Not a Nugent fan but people are allowed to change as the grow older or at least they should be and if heck Bill Ayers a known bomb using Communist terrorist (someone we would give life or execute in 2013 BTW) is allowed to have close contact and advise the President or heck is allowed to be a professor instead of a convict or an executed conviction , Nungent whose worst offense was maybe cowardice and petty draft dodging ought to be allowed his opinions as well. "
"This is the worst double standard from liberals Ive ever seen. It was Vietnam. Lots of people did crazy shit not to go to Vietnam. Dont hold it against someone who dodged the draft to avoid going to Vietnam. Its was a reasonable thing to do, and it doesnt make you a traitor or a coward, nor does it make it hypocritical to stand up for the country. Hate Nugent because hes a tool, not because he avoided going to one of the worst and most senseless conflicts in the 20th century."
so you are too cowardly not to serve the government special interests and kill yourself in a rich mans war? I think the Nuge is appreciative of the poor fools who think they are serving their country- but was smart enough not to do it himself. 
"I would do anything to avoid going to war. Not that I dont love and respect those who do, but Im too cowardly to go to war."
"Its true, Ted Nugent hasnt killed anyone - unlike that great hero of the Left [Bernardine Dohrn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardine_Dohrn), who was responsible for the deaths of cops and occasionally their own whacko lefties (out of incompetence). Brave, brave Bernadine. If only Ted could be more like her, and build bombs to blow up the innocent, the Left would love him."
TL;DR: Ted Nugent is a hypocrite pussy.
I dont agree with most of Ted Nugents opinions but because of Stranglehold I will always believe he is a badass. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQowAJAZgoU
He gave us Stranglehold. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c3d7QgZr7g Thats a good song. That is my only comment on the matter.
TIL fuck Ted Nugent
"This article is appalling. Nugent was against the Vietnam war. Are we really going to go ahead and call every conscientious objector to that embarrassing and revolting episode a coward, or just when its somebody we dont like? In general the article is a piece of childish vitriol, littered with just random and poorly articulated potshots at republicans over thing irrellevant to its main argument. Im no fan of Nugent or his party in general, but stuff like this isnt helping the case against them."
"Nugent is a huge douche, and a molester."
He is a proud member of the [Chickenhawk Hall of Fame] (http://www.nhgazette.com/display/?id=74)
Wait...so all you had to do to avoid the draft was shit and piss yourself for a week and they let you off the hook?? How does that work!?
Aaaaaaaannnnnddddddd...... I hate this subreddit. 
And the worst title of the year award goes to...
But? How is this a but sentence? He was too cowardly to serve (which is a bullshit way to phrase that) /and/ he blames Obama for their suicides. If he believes that government is responsible in some way for soldier suicides then it is perfectly consistent that he wouldnt want to serve.
"He did serve the nation he loved by not getting suckered into that waste of lives known as the Vietnam War, to be called a baby killer and spat upon by the leftards of the time. If you downvote, I assume you thought the Vietnam War was a good idea."
you can be against war but for the soldiers and victims of that war... just sayin. maybe motherfucker didnt wanna hunt humans... either way i could give a fuck less if he died tomorrow.
"Am I the only one here who can love this country, support the Constitution, and feel that objecting to foreign interventionism can all be done simultaniously? TL;DR: How does calling Ted Nugent a pussy make your argument any better than anyone elses argument?"
"Ted nugent is a smart motherfucker, only a fucking retard would fight in a war. Ted isnt defending war, hes defending the people who dont know any better and get their arms blown off."
I dont think his dodging the draft means he cant be critical or want to fight for better care for veterans. His putting all the blame on Obama though is fucked up. 
"terribly written article, his points arent bad, but horribly conveyed "
"If a soldier commits suicide because he realizes the graveness of his actions, why should it be discouraged rather than hailed as honorable?"
"title translation: i disagree with your point of view, so im going to resort to name calling. this is why we cant have nice things."
"Im not a fan of a man, but lets be serious for second. Which war was he called to serve in that was in service of the country and not merely economic interests?"
how do such biased journals make it to the front page of reddit? oh this is politics not journalism nvm.
I dont see how his actions lessen his argument. I also think this is a good example of how headlines create upvotes. 
"Lol OP might not know, but... Vietnam was kinda.. Universally panned"
"Oh look! Ad Hominem, *and* Appeal to Authority logical fallacies in the same article! Its like playing Shitty Journalism Bingo, and getting 3 out of 5 (middle square is a freebie)."
Im here for the Poop stories.
This article is slanted to absurd levels. Lets not forget that Bush was blamed for a Hurricane and 9/11. Who cares what some musician has to say about the president. This shouldnt be news. 
Refreshingly unbiased source.
Avoiding the draft doesnt make anyone less of a patriot. The United States military stopped being about defense a *long* time ago.
Got you in a stranglehold baby!
Only cowards cozy up to cowards he might get a dose of reality if he visited a Army hospital. Just shows how far batshit republicanism has gone.
Ted Nugent is a dick. 
"Regarding the post title, saying ted is cowardly because he wouldnt enlist. Well, you may call us cowardly, but those of us who would refuse to sacrifice our one only life for a body of land, but maybe we are the only ones thinking intelligently."
"Of course Ted Nugent is an idiot, but judging his arguments by his actions is just plain stupid. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#Tu_quoque"
How are these two things related?
Twas a long time ago.
AMA The Nooooge
Anybody criticizing or judging Nugent for draft dodging is about as intelligent as Nugent calling Obama a nazi or born America hater.
Nobody should ever have to justify their decision to not be part of a killing machine.
"From wikipedia: &gt;In 2006, an interviewer from the British newspaper The Independent questioned Nugent about a 1977 interview in High Times magazine in which Nugent admitted taking steps to avoid the Vietnam draft. In the interview Nugent says, contrary to the story in High Times, that I had a 1Y [student deferment]. I enrolled at Oakland Community College. Nugent also stated he made up the story because the High Times reporter was gullible."
"Hes a typical good-for-nothing, right wing chicken hawk. Act tough, talk tough but when its his time to serve he reveals how much of a pussy he really is. Id love to see people throw Depends adult diapers at him whenever he performs in concert."
"Yeah, yeah, Ted Nugent (whoever that is) is a nutjob, but I think the real question for everyone reading this is why havent I unsubscribed from r/politics?"
How many years have you served OP?
Dodging a draft is brave no matter how you do it.
"If I was in the service and obama was my commander in chief, Id kill myself too."
"Seriously, just fuck everything about Ted Nugent. In the world of politics hes irrelevent."
Whatever. Fuck murica.. Fuck Obama. And whatever it takes to stay out of war! The people who go to war are the reason wars still continue. Nugent speaks the truth. Wake up.
Shouldnt this read Ted Nugent was too cowardly to serve **and** he blames Obama for Veterans suicides? Those positions seem pretty consistent; I dont want to fight and I feel sorry for those that have.
"This is no different than plucking any other anonymous hillbilly out of the Ozarks and asking him what he thinks of the Ay-rab in the Presidents office. If Nugent hadnt enjoyed some modest fame from writing a few mediocre rock tunes 30+ years ago, we wouldnt even know who this guy is. Box him up with the other Good Old Boys and focus on commentary that matters."
ted should just STFU and play stranglehold. they didnt call him the madman of motor city for no apparent reason. this article acts like we all should be surprised.
umm...so what? Obama was too cowardly to serve as well. Nugent spends a lot of his free time associating with troops and getting to know them. Obama just sends them to die in pointless wars or marches them on stage for photo ops or to sell stupid people on more legislation. Fuck liberal hypocrites!
"A real tough guy. Dont forget self-admitting to being a pedophile, adopting his under age girlfriend, and chewing gum with his mouth open."
He should do commercials for depends.
Annnnnd your point is!?
Aaaaannnd Fuck Ted Nugent.
Who gives a shit about what this draft dodging chicken hawk thinks?
"On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, I give this article 10 crossbows. "
You mean old poop and pee pants nugent? Lets make that a thing now.
I would do the same. Smart guy.
Id rather urinate and defecate in my pants for the rest of my fucking life than hunt and kill another human being you sociopaths. Edit: Nugent is a sociopath too. 
This was actually false. I saw on 20/20 that he was allowed to miss military service because he was going to college. This is just some bullshit Dee Snider made up on his radio show.
So he weaseled his way out of being a military dog and being a cog is a worthless war? Good on him.
All I came here to say is that you can both love a country and be too scared to serve it.
"Never had to experience actively hunting and killing another human being? More than half of troop suicides are done before the person has gone off to combat. Im not saying its Obamas fault in any way, but the title is misleading."
Did Obama ever serve?
"What Ive learned from this title: * Avoiding an order from strangers to slaughter strangers for no cause of the American people is bad. * If you havent blindly answered the call of your masters, you cant complain about soldiers killing themselves."

"Ted Nugents an idiot, sure, but this woefully written article harms the authors case . . . if he/she has one. Very hard to tell amid the canopy jungle of generalities and run-on sentences."
Rubbish. Its not cowardly to avoid serving. Its quite stupid to put yourself into a position where you will be brainwashed and trained to kill and be killed. 
"you stupid fucks, do you not understand he was a fucking teenager when he was drafted? how would you react? i mean grow the FUCK up and try and understand why someone would do something like this. and i hope youll be mature enough to realize that people change, what a fucking surprise someone can change their tune over a 10 year period.../r/politics is the a safe haven for some of the stupidest fucking people in the world."
"&gt;When a person holds another person responsible for actions that are socially or morally irresponsible, and makes negative statements about the person that have no basis in fact, their blame is nothing more than sheer vitriol with the intent to incite opposition against the blameless party. Are they describing Alan Grayson? This sounds like Alan Grayson? Its Alan Grayson, isnt it? &gt;The effects and harm the Iraq War has caused this nation will plague Americans for generations Not as much as progressive welfare policies are plaguing black families in this country. These PoliticusUSA articles are hilarious. The writers should work for the Onion."
Obama hasnt had to do any of those things either. And he ignores it when other people doing it for him need his help.
I think we can all agree that Great White Buffalo was a good enough song to overlook all that nonsense 
"I went to high school with a guy who emulated Ted Nugent: played electric guitar, covered Nuges songs, hunted, etc. His girlfriend would regularly come to school with bruises on her body or concealed on her face. Not making it up and it doesnt prove anything; just thought Id share."
"typical left wing hack job without a name. If you cant attack the message, attack the messenger. Hey author....you want to hold someone responsible for a past indiscretion? What did you write about Robert Byrd. Dem senator for 51 years! Ex KKK member? "
That argument is weak and stupid.
Why compare Ted Nugent to Obama. Obama didnt serve either? lol..
"I wish we could make this a thing and see of we can troll Ted Nugent at speaking events and pressers with this question Ted, thanks for taking the question, huge fan of yours, is it true that you urinated and defecated yourself in order to avoid the draft? I want to force a recursive circle jerk among his audience using this talking point and liberal media conspiracy. "
Im sure this same argument could be made for someone hating goerge w bushs war time endeavors. But because its obama people dont care. 
[deleted]
Pant shat fever?
"Yeah he made up that story and admitted that years ago, he was in college and had student deferment like a lot of other kids. "
"Ted needs to be hanging out with the other draft dodgers, Muhammad Ali and Bill Clinton. "
Ted Nugent would rather fight against the US military than fight with the US military. 
New name? Ted Nugget? Ted Newpants? 
And heres where R/politics jumped the shark. 647 comments about Ted Nugent showing up on my front page. 
"What a fucking dusty, crusty puss Ted is."
That does it. Im going to chuck out my Ted Nugent Best of C-30 cassette. 
Dear Ted Nugent and Rush Lim (I dont care how its spelled) - Kindly fuck off- or each other. That is all. 
"No idea who ted nugget is but you dont have to join the army to ove your country, some people just arent cut it for it"
"The Nudge is a total dingleberry, you should flush turds, not hold them in your hands and say look at how much of a turd this is. Also LOTS of people dodged the draft in vietnam. Nobody will talk about it, except for the celebrities. Youre probably related to one. It certainly dosent mean they shouldnt have a politial opinion. Im a veteran and I for one do not Lord that fact over other people as if I have an heir of superiority. Hate because hes a moron, but dont convolute the argument with a decision he made 50 fucking years ago. I think this issue with the Obama Administration and veteran suicides is being made by alot of Liberal and Conservatives alike. And to make this a devisive issue, they wheel out bow and arrow draft dodger and do a story about him. And not the Dean veterans and their surviving families. Real classy. "
Going to war isnt serving your country. Do something useful instead.
Ted Nugent has done more good than Obama. Saying that Obama was the reason could be a drastic measure but dont talk like Ted Nugent is the coward of the world because hes not. We have others things to do than sit here and point fingers
"Nugent says that he made up the stuff about soiling himself to get a medical deferment. He does, however, admit that he went to college instead of going to serve his country. He is a typical example of someone bellowing from the sidelines to whom no-one would pay any attention were it not for his rock star status. All my life I have been baffled by the idea that we should listen to a sportsman or pop star or other celebrity on matters not related to their experience and expertise. The correct response to ol Ted, it seems to me, is Yeah, whatever. Make some more fucking music, or retire already. But *shut the fuck up* about politics."

The current Republican Party consists of three words: NO. BLAME OBAMA.
"discussion on right wing politics is fucking pointless, discussion about left ideas is important. what the fuck is wrong with never having experienced actively hunting and killing human beings? whats wrong with reacting the way he did to the possibility of going to a war and dieing? why is it so bad to protest killing other humans?"
"&gt; Ted Nugent Was Too Cowardly to Serve... That was one of the few *smart* and *honorable* things Nugent has done! Going like a sheep to the slaughter to fight in Vietnam was in itself not bravery. Once in Vietnam, some soldiers did brave things, thats true. But the acts of getting a physical and going into the military was not bravery, it was just fulfilling social expectations. The people that refused to fight in Vietnam were also brave -- they were risking being locked up in a cage by a brutal govt who wanted to wage war and kill people of another country, all because the US govt broke an intl agreement to hold elections in Vietnam because the CIA correctly reported that the communist leader and Vietnamese natl hero Ho Chi Minh would easily win any free and fair election. So the US backed a Catholic dictator in a Buddhist country and waged war to keep the puppet govt in power. As another brave man, Muhammad Ali, said when he gave up the heavyweight championship of the world and refused to fight in Vietnam, I will not go 10,000 miles from here to help murder and kill another poor people simply to continue the domination of white slave masters over the darker people of the earth. And fighting in Vietnam was not serving the American people! Fighting in Vietnam was merely serving a corrupt and brutal govt -- the war *impoverished* the American people and cost the US govt so much money that Richard Nixon had to detach the US dollar from the gold standard to cause inflation it inflate away the massive costs/debt of the war. &gt; I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class thug for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. -- USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, winner of 2 Congressional Medals of Honor."
"He served his nation in the capacity of entertainer. Its not cowardly, in my opinion, to avoid harming human beings at the behest of another. It is the opposite. Heroic. "
"This is a stupid headline and a stupid argument. Avoiding service is in no way related to veterans advocacy. In fact, theyre arguably consistent: if you think soldiers have it rough then youd be more likely to advocate for soldiers interests and youd also do everything you damned could in order to avoid becoming one."
Dodging an unjust war by refusing to become a slave is bad?
What the fuck does this have to do with politics?
"Wait, so Nugent doesnt die in a bullshit war initiated by the US by a bullshit incident that didnt even happen (Gulf of Tonkin) and continues to do his own thing. But hes not allowed to criticize how soldiers today have to deal with mental problems brought on by (what the majority of people claim) is an unnecessary war. Im not enlisted am I allowed to criticize? Can we find out the names of some average Joes who dodged as well? Oh yea, thats not a fucking news story. Why dont we help the Veterans? And everyone else affected by mental illness?"
"Its not just Obamas fault. He is presiding over and perpetuating a state of futile and useless war, started by Bush. Furthermore, we call these men and women heroes when we send them over there to fight so our corporations can acquire natural resources, aka liberation. Once they come back, we forget about them. If we are a democracy or a republic, then we the people are to blame more than anyone. This bullshit wont stop until we undergo a mass transformation. Everyone should watch the documentary Ghetto Physics."
"&gt;I disagree with current policy but anyone who actually avoids enforcing that policy when called in a draft is a bad person. How dare he simultaneously disagree with policy AND do everything in his power to avoid enforcing it. What a disgusting human being, right guys? "
I hate when people act like being drafted into vietnam was some kind of noble calling and every american male should be honored to serve his country in such a way. Fuck that. Id shit my pants too. Its just annoying to see people act high and mighty when it serves their argument--trying to make a proponent of guns look bad--when in reality they dont even support the thing he attempted to escape from 40-50 years ago
In no way was the Vietnam War a service to America. Avoiding the draft was the patriotic thing to do. There is nothing more unamerican than conscription. 
"I know a guy who is a reserve in the Marines but he has never seen combat because he is a suicide risk. Yet he talks shit and thinks hes better than everyone else because he has the title of Marine. No respect for those types of people. Its fucking cowardly IMO. Ill admit that Im a pussy and I would never put my life on the line for this country. But if youre gonna join the service, man the fuck up or get the fuck out."
"Dodging the draft doesnt make you a coward, but Ted Nugent is definitely a coward."

Umm wouldnt you try to dodge the draft if you had to serve in the bullshit war known as Vietnam? 
This is just a distraction from the real issues. Like Nugents pedophilia.
Why cant this guy die already...
"sooo lemme get this straight, a guy with enough sense to avoid being a pawn for morons, who want people to go commit acts of unthinking murderous violence, is getting a bad rap because he has pointed out that soldiers are committing suicide in ever growing numbers. That these soldiers have been made through orders to commit egregious acts of criminal violence against other humans in illegal wars to support a bunch of psychopathic greedy shit stains, and he is the one in the wrong?. i fucking despair. "
"I cant go to war, the enemy will fire back at me. I only shoot at things that are unable to defend themselves. - Ted Nugent"
"The author is quick to judge Ted Nugent. As a veteran who never saw combat, Ill tell you that a very low percentage of us see any combat at all. That a deployment doesnt necessarily mean combat. And that just a deployment in itself can present all the stress and hardship needed to drive people/families on this route. Military families know this. Its the separation, and all the millions of problems that stem from it. Theres nothing wrong with advocating and trying to help. If I were him and dodged the draft, Id feel bad too."
And what branch of the armed services did Obama serve in?
Its funny because there were liberals in charge in Bush Government as well... Both parties are equally as crooked.
hypocrisy of the messenger does not make the message untrue. 
God bless this long title
99% of the country is in the same boat as Ted.
1) He was too cowardly to serve. BUT 2) He blames Obama for Veterans suicide. How the fuck are these two statements related...? How is the fact that he was too cowardly to serve in the army related in any way or relevant to the fact that he thinks Obama is responsible for veterans who commit suicide? Am I just thick or does this title make very little sense?
"I have never seen such a biased website. Theres a link for the GOPS War on women Obama ads everywhere, and Ted Nugent is also a horrible horrible NRA member. Hard to give this website credidation when theyre as blindingly left wing as they are. Couldnt even finish the article. Not defending Ted Nugent though, what he did was cowardly"
Wait so youre telling me a rock star from the 70s made some questionable character choices? 
My friends and I call him little teddie pee pee pants.
Third-person talking shithead. 
"[This](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/wtf/did_ted_nugent_puke_on_himself_to_avoid_draft.html) is fucking gold: High Times: How did you get out of the draft? Nugent: ?Ted was a young boy, appearing to be a hippie but quite opposite in fact, working hard and playing hard, playing rock and roll like a deviant. People would question my sanity, I played so much. So I got my notice to be in the draft. Do you think I was gonna lay down my guitar and go play army? Give me a break! I was busy doin? it to it. I had a career Jack. If I was walkin? around, hippying down, getting? loaded and pickin? my ass like your common curs, I?d say ?Hey yeah, go in the army. Beats the poop out of scuffin? around in the gutters.? But I wasn?t a gutter dog. I was a hard workin?, mother****in? rock and roll musician. I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin? and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin? kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and I?d drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up. See, I approached the whole thing like, Ted Nugent, cool hard-workin? dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces. I?m gonna play their own game, and I?m gonna destroy ?em. Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss. I was ill. And three or four days before, I started stayin? awake. I was close to death, but I was in control. I was extremely antidrug as I?ve always been, but I snorted some crystal methedrine. Talk about one wounded mother fucker. A guy put up four lines, and it was for all four of us, but I didn?t know and I?m vacuuming that poop right up. I was a walking, talking hunk of human poop. I was six-foot-three of sin. So the guys took me down to the physical, and my nerves, my emotions were distraught. I was not a good person. I was wounded. But as painful and nauseous as it was ? ?cause I was really into bein? clean and on the ball ? I made gutter swine hippies look like football players. I was deviano. So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldn?t believe the smell. They were ridiculin? me and pushin? me around and I was cryin?, but all the time I was laughin? to myself. When they stuck the needle in my arm for the blood test I passed out, and when I came to they were kicking me into the wall. Then they made everybody take off their pants, and I did, and this sergeant says, ?Oh my God, put those back on! You [expletive]? swine you!? Then they had a urine test and I couldn?t piss, But my poop was just like ooze, man, so I poop in the cup and put it on the counter. I had poop on my hand and my arm. The guy almost puked. I was so proud. I knew I had these chumps beat. The last thing I remember was wakin? up in the ear test booth and they were sweepin? up. So I went home and cleaned up. They took a putty knife to me. I got the street rats out of my hair, ate some good steaks, beans, potatoes, cottage cheese, milk. A couple of days and I was ready to kick ass. And in the mail I got this big juicy 4-F. They?d call dead people before they?d call my ass. But you know the funny thing about it? I?d make an incredible army man. I?d be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and I?d have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin? killers you?d ever seen in my platoon. But I just wasn?t into it. I was too busy doin? my own thing, you know??"

Still a great fucking guitar player.The Nuge lives to play and provoke.
"If Ted Nugent were born a man, she would have served in the military. Instead, we have to hear her talk about how she would have been some kind of super soldier. If I ever met that piece of shit, Id try to take his manhood, but it wouldnt work because he has none to take. Shes probably a secret vegetarian. "
"So the fuck what? Liberal darling Bill Clinton played the education deferment card and Chevy Chase pretended he was gay. A lot of people were draft dodgers in the 60s and 70s. Some became famous, some didnt. "
"If you look at most assholes the right way, you can at least imagine some good, some contribution to society. Not Ted Nugent. Everyone needs to know about his past. "
One of the very very few posts in this shithole sub I can get behind
"Please upvote for visibility to avoid misinformation I absolutely despise Ted Nugent but this story isnt actually true. Ted made up this story himself as a joke and then recanted years later. However, you cant blame OP because Its such a well known story and Nugent was the idiot that started it. He actually had a 1Y classification (student deferment) that allowed him to avoid the war, but when he was being interviewed in 1977 by High Times, he decided that he didnt like the reporter and thought he would be gullible enough to bite on a fake story. The rest is history. Tl;dr- This isnt a true story but Nugent is still an asshole and is the one who started the story in the first place."
This is the stupidest article ever. Liberal pussies. 
"Theres a problem when an entire country starts calling citizens cowards and discrediting them for not wanting to pick up a gun and start hunting and killing other human beings. If thats what it means to serve a nation, then maybe that nation isnt worth serving."
"Dude, Obama hasnt served either. "
"Wow. Im from Australia so I dont know who or what this guy is, but I know for sure that he seems like the biggest cunt on Earth."
"He basically just admitted to dodging the draft by acting like he had a mental disease only to profit immensely, while real Americans who also probably could have had a future were drafted to be killed serving their country and the constitution. Im utterly disgusted by this coward."
This article is so biased it hurts my eyes to read. (PS: not an american so I dont have much knowledge about what is being said but articles like this sure dont help)
"Muhammed Ali also didnt join the army when he was told to, is he a coward? Can he not have a political opinion now? You people disgust me. I commend any person that would rather shit their pants for a week than kill another human being. "
"Oh Americans, youre so dumb :3"
[deleted]
"Yes, I hate a lot of his political views. Im sure Ill get downvoted for this, but the Ted Nugent (1975) album is one of the best rock albums ever made. "
I am not a Ted Nugent fan but I dont see the correlation here. Do you have to have been a part of something to criticize its leadership? I would hope not. Otherwise everyone that has never been a republican can criticize them. If people didnt have opinions about shit they havent taken part in then reddit would be pretty dead.
"I dont any r/guns/ nutcases arguing for their long time board member of the NRA..... when children are killed they get up in everyones grill.... but I dont see any of them in this thread supporting their fellow mental defected piece of human garbage..... hey, gunnuts.... over here....."
You clearly know nothing about Ted Nugent.
"The story is not entirely true, he recanted the draft dodging story saying he was screwing with the interviewer. The official records show he had a student deferment for 2 years and was reclassified then rejected as a result of a medical exam, and reclassified as a 1Y. As medical records are protected it is unknown why the exam rejected him. But then so many news organizations these days seem to love run half truth stories with inflammatory titles for hits or ratings. "
"God what an angry, blatantly biased blog."
So anyone who hasnt went to war cant love their country? Im confused on what this title is trying to say other than to bash nugent
Great... Now can we have a real article deserving of the top spot on r/politics?
"Because to love your borders means to follow superiors blindly, and kill innocent humans, for a war most didnt believe in."
What a shit argument 
"Remember when Teddy said he would be either dead or in jail if Obama got re-elected? Yeah. Coward, through and through."
"to say im not a fan of nugent would be an understatement, but id say the commander in chief of the armed forces of the united states is a bit more responsible for how veterans are cared for than some asshole singer."
Well then fuck him
"I also blame obama for vet suicides only because he continues needless wars, being the commander-in-chief. I also think ted is a total dingbat. On a similar note, I cant wait until GenX-Y starts running things and we can move past this false left-right paradigm."
Fag.
How is this political?
"A. Now that the Pentagon itself has said a national draft is a Bad Idea and only wants volunteers for the forces (volunteers consisting of poor kids with minimal ability to go upward in economic class) people feel safe in mocking those who would avoid the draft. Make no mistake. Many would be copying his technique if a draft came up. Ive heard worse stories from my mom, who watched some friends get drafted out of high school. B. If we dont do something to alieviate climate change, well all be suffering like this guy. "
"ITT: People who believe being too dirty and stinky got you out of the Vietnam draft. LOL. OMFG Reddit, youre fucking priceless... Fucking cannot stop laughing...XD"
This post is stupid. You are stupid. PoliticusUSA is stupid. 
"Well, he can make the pussy purr with the stroke of his hand."
"And thats wrong with refusing to kill people who did nothing to you? Fucking finicky reddit. Oh, thats right - he identifies with the right so everything he does is a bullshit selfish act."
Nugent 2016
They make it seem like no one has ever dodged the draft before....
Yeah well Obama didnt serve either...so I guess theyre both assholes..
"People who live in glass houses... This is coming from the side that opposed the war in Vietnam. Uncle Ted served by rocking! Rocking aint no walk in the park, lady!"
This is as true a comentary as there ever was one. I cant upvote enough.
"Im amazed hes not dead or in jail like he said he would be. Wait never mind, No Im not."
Ted Nugent could be a hypocrite and might be less of a patriot than he claims to be? Get outta here...
His thinking was ahead of his time. Just like Mohammad Ali refused to kill people he dosnt know. Its fucked up that you can try link in killing Korean people that have nothing to do with you into how much you love your country. If anything he loves his country more by how upset he is that Veterans come back not able to integrate back into society. From a war that was never even won. In the words of Smedley Butler Americas most decorated general - If the people who enacted the wars had to be in the trenches themselves there would be a lot less wars https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3_EXqJ8f-0 
"Ive always wondered why entertainment celebrities deserve the credit for being a spokesperson for our society? Regardless if a person can act, sing, or tell jokes, what credibility do they earn as a political pundit. I cant even stand 90% of the political pundits, who generally are just journalist with no or little real background in politics. Have any of these so call experts, sources, etc. ever ran for elected office? Been forced to chose between raising taxes or cutting services? Been responsible for protecting citizens by supporting or Police, Fire, EMS, Military, or cutting them when they become a onerous tax burden? Anyone one of these celebrities or journalists would be the first one to file a lawsuit against a government, when they slipped on dog poop left on the city sidewalk left by their own dog, and then complain about the cost of running government because insurance costs are so high!

"Oh the old only military members can make decisions about the military fallacy. Pacifists are citizens too and have as much say as those who have hunted humans. Lets do the reverse and see how well it flies with you Those who have been in the military, indoctrinated in it, and hunted humans should have NO SAY in military decisions! They are all warmongers and bloodthirsty dickbags who joined just to slaughter folks and want to perpetuate global war! Only those who havent been brain damaged by that shit are worth listening to! See how that is fucked up? "
Neither has Obama. 
Yeah this is true. All his music sucked shit too.
"Im sorry, is this an /r/circlejerk post?"
"Dont care at all about Ted Nugent. Not even a little. I dont even agree with him here. But the fact that Obama has decimated the right to privacy of Americans (as did Bush before him), and increased our risk of more war in the Middle East, has sided coming and going with the Bankers over the people, has watched without comment or reaction as the Income Gap continues to grow... All of that is fact. Ted is scum. Okay. But that is no defense of Obama, unjust wars, and sending people to die for corporate interests."
We should see if we can get North Korea to trade us Kenneth Bae for Ted Nugent. It would be an excellent deal for both parties.
"Quick, people are talking about Guantanamo, we need a distraction!!"
"What is your point, he seems pretty consistent to me. He was against military service then and hes against it now. Who says it is about cowardice either? I wouldnt join our military either because I dont believe in killing people, not because Im a coward but because it is wrong."
Have none of you people seen the cover of Weekend Warriors? Nugent is a warrior and a God damned national treasure. 
All hair; no balls.
too cowardly? just smart imo..why would u go in the fucking army?
"Wow, this article could not have been more blatant about the writers Democratic fanaticism. Every sentence was worked to be anti-Republican in some way. Calling Nugent a gun fanatic as if it matters to the topic and making claims about how the Iraq War was solely for oil without presenting proof and worst of all, making implications that a Democratic Administration and President have never fucked the country over. Regardless of truth or fiction, regardless of Nugent being a draft dodging shit-talker, the article wasnt very credible or professional because of the way it was written. For clarification, I have no political party affiliation; I think both groups are idiotic."
i hate that this idiot is considered a spokesman for my rights
"Ted Nugent wasnt scared, nothing was going in 1977 why would he serve? Its not like the Jews declared war on Germany for a 3rd time."

The Nuge is a Stooge
"Snopes claims that this story is not true, as does Nugent. But, this story does show up in an interview with Nugent in 1977. Nugent claims he was just bullshitting a gullible reporter. But, Nugent also claimed that he would be dead or in jail by spring if Obama won re-election. He isnt. Which, considering what kind of idiot Nugent really is, is unfortunate."

"What a fucking smear campaign, no need to read this shit. Are we really concerned about fucking Ted Nugent not servering his military term in full? Holy hell, talk about a distraction."
Cool. Where did Obama serve? Where did he learn about commanding a military and sending men to die?
Cowardly is hiding when you should be fighting for something you believe in. Why would anyone in their right mind fight for something they dont believe in?
"Ted Nugent annoys me almost as much as anyone, but since when do we conflate fighting in Vietnam as serving our country? Our country would have been better served if everyone told the politicians to fuck themselves and fight their own damn war -- as this country was intended."
"He also got a mother of a minor to sign her parental rights away to her daughter so that he could legally fuck the daughter without any recourse. Yep, hes a real scumbag. "
"TIL because of Ted Nugent, the Left no longer idolizes Vietnam-era draft dodgers. I guess we better stop calling Muhammed Ali an American Hero."
"I am so glad that Ted Nugent never served, he would have got people killed."
"Well, no one should have to serve in the army if they choose not to, so i cant blame the guy for not wanting to die for a cause that few believed in for a country that he loves. No man should have to die for boundaries, when you stop to think about it, it is an insane concept."
Such an unbiased title.
Liberals
"Obama had the privilege of growing upin an era, like most of is, when the government did not come to make kids fight in die against their will. Not enough training, not enough equipment, and a war fought on false pretext, would you go because the government told you you had to?"
"The key thing I hate about the gun debate is that people who are anti-control tends to be extremes in the debate. Ted is probably the worse possible person to put in as a front man for the gun debate. My opinion is that they should show the millions of normal people who own firearms, who served, and so fort as the real front people. The American public isnt like Ted who screams rhetoric at the president. We just want to own firearms, and do not believe that gun owners should be criminalized by something someone else did. Sort of like saying taking away cars because anyone can drive drunk."
"As an infantry veteran with a purple heart, I feel both Obama and Nugent are steaming piles of shit."
An NRA card does not a veteran make. Anybody who wants to blame the President can write their own damn suicide note.
Pics or it didnt happen. I better seem some shi-stains if you are going to make this kind of claim. Back it up you pompous OP!
"First off, theres nothing wrong with avoiding the draft. The Vietnam War was bullshit and the draft for it was bullshit. Draft dodging isnt unpatriotic or cowardly. Second, what the hell does him dodging the draft have to do with his opinion on veteran suicides? Having an opinion on veteran suicides makes you an asshole now if you havent fought in a war? How does that make any sense? Third, his opinion on veteran suicides is retarded, but who gives a fuck? This thread/article is just as stupid. "
"Ted Nugent is such an idiot, why does this even matter?"
I cant really fault Nugent for avoiding Vietnam. I would have done the exact same thing. What I do fault Nugent for is that while he seems to have been pretty clear headed when he was young he has since become a fool. And not only a fool but a very cruel man.
[/r/politics](/r/politics) Pro-war now?
I wouldnt call Vietnam serving the nation that he loves. Id call Vietnam serving the war mongering/profiteering military industrial complex. And I applaud anyone that did whatever it took to get out of going to that war and any if the many other unconstitutional wars weve been in since WWII.
Ted Nugent is as insane as Mark Sullivan. To hell with them both.
"so now you must be pro-war to be pro-america? lol, this cognitively-dissonant circle-jerk is pathetic."
i think from now on whenever someone shits themselves they should call it the ted nugent
The only thing that surprises me more than how often this story gets posted on Reddit is how often it actually makes the front page.
Ted Nugent is a shitbird. Fuck that guy.
Nugent is a crazy assholr. Always has been.
"Not wanting to support the military industrial complex, or kill anyone for that matter. Isnt a bad thing imo. The pioneers of a warless world are the youth who refuse military service - Ya boy Albert Einstein "
"Hypocracy is underrated. Dodging the draft is braver and more noble, no matter who you are."
"The only reason this is news is because Ted doesnt lean towards the Left. There were a ton of draft dodgers back in the day, including Hendrix. Some people just arent fit to serve, and if theyre forced to, theyre just going to get someone killed. Been serving for almost 6 years now and you need to be sure that you have your buddys back and that they have yours. Its scary out there and you cant afford compromise. I dont blame Ted for blaming Obama. The majority of the people on the civilian side have no clue how the VA is these days. People not getting paid/treatment/etc. Vets are treated horribly these days, I see and hear it quite often."
"I thought the whole thing about him shitting on himself was just a story for a radio show, Im pretty sure he avoided the draft because he was a student. Draft dodger or not hes still an idiot."
"Seriously, WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THIS. The rate of suicide in the military is not any higher than it is in the regular civilian population. So lets stop fucking talking about it. The majority of the soldiers committing suicide HAVE NOT served in a combat role. A small minority of the suicides have been in combat. The main reasons for suicide in the military are the main reasons for suicide of a civilian. Money troubles, family troubles, wife troubles. Source? - My M-I-L is a suicide prevention coordinator for the US Army in Germany. "
He is a fucking ass-wipe. Pure and simple. It is far past time for him to shut his mouth.
"&gt; ...has never had to experience actively hunting and killing another human being... wow OP, not helping your argument there. nugent is scum, but he is right in this instance. obama is the commander-in-chief, and were still in two foreign countries (officially) for 10 years; half of it during his term. how can he not be as responsible as bush ii for the soldiers who have been killing themselves--almost one a day--because of the mental scars they have? "
Hes so gay
Trolls. 
"Im no Ted Nugent fan, but this is a terrible argument, the kind neo conservatives use. They cant criticize the war, theyre not giving their life for the country!"
Ha if you think the war in Afghanistan was about protecting US citizens you are sadly mistaken. I prob wouldve gone either
Whats the big deal dodging a war that everyone knew was a dead end. Nugents an asshole but not because he dodged the draft. 
Fuck Ted Nugent. 
"The left on reddit &amp; IRL constantly bitch about useless wars, especially Vietnam. If Nugent were a lib, hed be a fucking hero to the same people calling him out here. While I agree that his actions are shameful and cowardly - the hypocrisy here is worth mentioning."
"This entire thread is an ad hominem attack on Nugent. I challenge the OP to actually rebut the fact that Obama is responsible for vererans suicides. I dont blame Nugent or anyone else one bit for not wanting to get killed for a completely useless, immoral, unjustified, and illegal war like Vietnam. The left are so rabid in their defense of Obama that theyre willing to stoop to a completely fascist conservative pro-war position like this just to make a point of smearing someone who dislikes Obama."
"OPs title reads as because Nugent is a shithead, Obama must be innocent. This is a cut and dry fallacy. How about this: Nugent is a terrible person. And Obama is also indirectly responsible for veteran suicides."
Killing someone because someone else toled you to. Thats what it all boils down to 
More people need to know this about him. He is the worst kind of chicken-hawk
"I couldnt give two shits about Ted Nugent. However as I read this, I thought, here we have an 18 year old in a time when attitudes toward the draft and war were maybe different than now. People do change too, and I decided to cut the guy some slack. Not that I really care about him one way or the other - not really worth the brain cell exercise."
"Ah, chickenhawks. If you respect them, youre probably an idiot."
"http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/nugent.asp Ted is a trip, here is an old but interesting article peeking into some context for his mindset: http://web.archive.org/web/20091115001316/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/ted-nugent-off-his-rocker-479556.html Rising suicide rates in the military is a problem though, for those in active service and for veterans of service.

Ted Nugent is a piece of shit douchebag who should be hunted for sport. Hes too old and stringy to eat. 
"This is stupid, r/politics should have higher quality stuff than garbage like this."
"Although I dont care if he decided not to fight in a bullshit war (I have fought both in Iraq and Afghanistan so I know the meaning of the term). What I mind is how absolutely insane he is. In one sentence he will claim to love America and everything that it is, how its gods gift to the world, and how the rest of the world should be like America, and then he goes on to quote European history incorrectly. Then with the next sentence hes demonizing people who dont have the same religious or political beliefs that he has even though they are what makes up the American system..."
I recently heard him in an interview and he said he made all that up for high times because he hated pot smoking hippies. It also explains it a bit on wikipedia.
Ted is a douche! But a hard rockin douche!
[A logical fallacy that this subreddit loves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem)
I didnt realize it was better to be a dead hero than a living coward.
"Can someone help me out, Im a little confused. How does avoiding the Vietnam war diminish how much a person loves their country? I can possibly see the argument work for WWII, but the Vietnam War? What does that have to do with loving the USA? How does standing up and saying, No, I wont go murder innocent people make you a coward?"

"Heres another ground breaking statement: unless they make it mandatory for *all* workers, instead of just those working full-time, it wont matter. Businesses will just cut more peoples hours in half, and hire on others because itll be cheaper. Just like how they stupidly react to Obama care."
"part time employees are covered too... anyone working 25 hours a week whos been there for 1 year would get the same benefit. what i find TRULY sad is that our corporations want to take over running the country, but they dont want the responsibility of actually taking care of the people. if you cant do the second, you sure as hell shouldnt be trying to do the first."
"You can call them selfish or mean, but theyre hardly stupid -- it was Obama and the bill authors who were stupid to think if they said, You have to pay a lot more money to have a full time worker than a part time one that business owners werent going to get rid of full time workers and make them all part time."
"Its **extremely** stupid of them. The vast majority of American jobs are service based, and those services arent needed to survive. Do you know what happens when every American worker is put on half hours? They stop spending money. Thats **REAL** Trickledown Economic. Shit Trickles down hill. You take away a workers spending power and our economy is fucked. Well, *more* fucked. "
Shitty job creators are shitty. 
What middle class?
"At lower levels sure, but for middle class jobs this will be a help. Im so shocked how many people expect McDonalds/Walmart/Papa Johns etc to be the supplier of middle class jobs, theyre not. No one is going to cut the hours of a middle class worker because of this. "
"Yea, if it werent for those stupid companies doing exactly what **they and everyone else said theyd fucking do** Obamacare would have been much more successful. People do *exactly* what theyre incentives have them do. "
"Thats possibly the goal of this, half workers time, no vacation days, twice the number of workers, half the unemployment rate without coating the business profit and bragging rights of low unemployment. It its been said before I apologise for not feeding down the thread to see it."
"Which is why we need federal regulations that eliminate the entire concept of full-time and part-time and just require that business owners offer a minimum level of benefits to their employees regardless of how many or how few hours they work, or else pay the financial penalty come tax time which will help fund the public exchanges. The whole full-time/part-time system exists solely to abuse workers. What other reason is there for it even to exist? To a job creator that hires hourly workers, whether they work 20 hours or 40 hours a week is immaterial to his bottom line in terms of the amount of work theyre doing, since hes paying them by the hour, its solely a matter of the ancillary benefits that weve rightly come to expect due to hundreds of years of history showing us that these things are required in first-world society. Either that, or peg the threshold between part- and full-time to something really low, like 8 hours per week. That way, scumbag Walmart *can* hire 5 times more people and employ them all for a single day if they want to push the matter to the absurd...but the required infrastructure the company would have to fund (just processing the payroll alone would take enormous amounts of manpower, they already have over a million employees, not to mention the logistical necessities of hiring more support personnel just to handle those employees) would far outweigh the financial benefit to them playing this stupid game in the first place."
"As long as anyone other then the government is paying for health care, the private sector will do all it can to divest itself of responsibility for paying for it."

"Actually in many countries even the part time workers get paid leave, the accumilate it with the amount of days they worl so 1 day might equal 1/30th of a day due by the company, 1 days paid leave a month or 12 days a year. When an employee has worked for more than 3 years it is increased and then at 10 years increased again until it is three weeks or 21 days in total, they holiday can be accrued over no more than 5 years and if you resign or are fired for any reason then they have to pay you for the days you are due.In the Uk this is even relevant for those people that work contract jobs."
"The number of hours of paid holidays should be linked to number of hours worked, mandatory for all workers, so a person on 10 hours per week gets 1/4 the holidays of a person on 40 hours per week."
"Theyll have to make it mandatory for all workers and end all right-to-work laws at the same time, or employers will just fire those who use their mandated vacation time instead of picking up an extra weeks pay on their fee-laden USBank pay card."
Ive worked 39hr weeks at plenty of jobs. They wont let you touch 40 or you get benefits.
"It should be set up based on hours worked. For instance, for every 40 hours worked, someone has to accrue 1 hour of vacation time. If thats split among 2 people, they each get a half hour."
Unemployment would plummet!
"Your normal wage will be reduced to compensate for the increased costs of the paid vacation. In other words, this will only help those who are currently recieving minimum wage (and who wont have their hours cut)."
I fully agree.
There really isnt any evidence a substantial amount of employers are doing anything because of ObamaCare. [Thats just right wing noise.](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/07/gop-mistweets-obamacare-survey-results/) 
"Im not saying these are definitely good things especially in the short term, but over the long term I think reducing hours may be necessary and desirable. Thats only true if compensation and the safety net make reduced hours a livable situation. Contracting the labor market through reduced availability in time just might put upward pressure on wages as available domestic labor hours fall by 25% or more. Thats only true if people can live at those reduced hours though, which right now many cannot. Part-time at near minimum wage with a weak safety net wont cut it. Something sneakingly within the ACA situation though is that putting hour pressure on employers while still providing access to healthcare through subsidy may end up helpful. This puts people into the exchanges. The exchange insurance is subsidzed based on income. Effectively, it moves people away from employer health care towards a portability arrangement. The big flaws are if people are unable to live on their wages, they may fail to acquire coverage, the safety net may fail to adequately tax to cover costs and private ensurers are still in the mix taking too big a piece of the pie. However, in the here and now Im sure a lot of people will feel the pain of reduced hours. I think we shouldnt have tied hours to coverage by employers, but instead raised an insurance fund from hour 1 giving employees choice in how that fund was allocated to their health insurance. If they wanted to buy into the employer plan, an exchange plan, a state plan or whatever I think that would have been much better. Still, I think we have to withdraw hours from the labor market so long as there is one."
Bye bye small businesses.
Yeah well they Have a feduciary responsibility to the shareholders to maximize profits.
"Or do what my employer does, and hire me as a part time employee but require me to work over 40 hours a week fairly often. I would have to reapply as a full time employee to get any benefits, despite actually working full-time hours."
welp can only work 23 hours now instead of 35+
"But then theyll have more time with their families, improve their mental and physical health, and be ultimately more productive in the workplace. "
"Think of it this way, those workers who had their hours cut will now be able to spend more time with their families and improve their mental health."
"I have several friends who went from full time to part recently and then received letters from their employers about their insurance being discontinued, citing Obamacare as the reason. "
Yup. Can confirm. My girlfriends hours just got cut from 40 to 29 . Lost her insurance so now she is going to apply for access for her and het two kids here in AZ. 
Are there really no laws that prevent a company from having tons of part time employees to get out of paying for benefits?
Im fine with this. If citizens are rebelling the military should stop them.

"Look at Egypt though. Two times the army has stepped in on the side of the people. Seeing ass the army is there to serve and protect the people, not the government, why would it be hard to believe that theyd do the same here?"
"Funnily enough, recently here in the uk, a copy of an Eton exam paper was released/leaked, and one of the excercises asked the student to pretend he was the PM, and write a speech to the public justifying the moral grounds of using military force on the general population. Quite incredible. "
I love the new German model for soldiers which states that their primary and overriding order is to ignore all other orders that they feel are morally wrong or will cause harm. They are actively encouraged to ignore orders that they feel may cause harm or hurt someone.
GTFO - whos this top military veteran.
"Very good question, the attitude around the time it turned out Iraq didnt have weapons was Im a soldier not a politician, I dont have any reason to believe its changed. Just look at what the attitude of the police force is, most have served in some branch of the military. Although some of reddit knows whats happening in Egypt a large percentage of Americans are in the dark. The biggest news corporations call it a coup so theres no reason for anyone who relies on them to think differently. We are slowly becoming more aware but theres no need to question anything as long as things are well. Edit: Grammar"

"&gt;Unlike in previous major wars, the United States has **cut taxes** at the same time it has increased military spending. Its fair to say all of the money spent on the war has been borrowed, says Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank in Washington. But eventually [everything has to be paid for.](http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0116/p01s01-usfp.html) Its even worse than you propose. Not only were none of the costs of the wars in the budget, they cut taxes to insure none of the costs could be paid at the time. It all went on the credit card so the next generation can pay for it. So not only will this generation get to pay their outrageous student loans, they can pay for two wars they only read about in history books. "
"&gt; Not only were none of the costs of the wars in the budget, they cut taxes to insure none of the costs could be paid at the time. It all went on the credit card so the next generation can pay for it. That infuriates me. If Republicans were really as fiscally responsible as they claim, they would have raised taxes temporarily to pay for the wars. Not only did they never raise taxes, they even made sure that none of the spending for the wars even went into the normal budget (because that would make the deficit look worse at their hands), instead choosing to fund it solely through emergency appropriations measures, year after year. And whats sad is that the average citizen wasnt outraged. In fact, they were completely disengaged. "
"And when they read about them, they read about them as a terrible GOP move that will cost the party a generation. And that generation will always be extremely skeptical of Republicans and diving into wars headfirst. Its already happening. Since 2008, the young voters have been significantly more left than the other ages, in the first time in at least 40 years. The young voters always used to track with the older votes fairly closely. Now it diverges. "
"It is bad enough that the government had to borrow the money to pay for the wars, but what is worse imho, is that the Pentagon can not even complete an audit at all. [(source)](http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/apr/13/peter-defazio/defazio-says-pentagon-cant-track-its-budget-we-aud/) So how do we even know that all that borrowed money can be accounted for?

dont forget we wont have medicare or social security! hooray for debt!
"&gt;So not only will this generation get to pay their outrageous student loans I wouldnt be too optimistic about those loans getting repaid: there just isnt enough money to go around. As the statutes of limitation pass on more and more of these loans and banks start to realize that money is gone, look for more aggressive legislation being enacted to allow them to continue pursuing collection efforts. That money still isnt going to be there, though, and the ensuing write-off isnt going to be pretty. Itll be the home loans crisis all over again. "

Actually, that would be 41.5%. I see math is not your strong suit. Now, your real issue is that youre making up numbers. Your claim of $5.97 trillion is fallacious.

"Either way, the schools wind up wasting tons of money in court instead of spending it on education."
Why do you think the mainstream would flip out? According to this site (http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/godpoll.asp) something like 90% of people like the phrase in the pledge of allegiance and on money.
"Yeah, bollocks. Slapping the phrase on schools effectively instructs students to trust God. Thats nakedly theological. Even this precedent that putting it on every piece of currency nationwide is not theological is a bullshit dodge. Spiritual value is a purely theological concept. Its not inspirational unless you are religious. Personally I think the problem of evil makes trust in any monotheistic deity abhorrent. If this is the best world an omnipotent omniscience could build then I want a refund. "

The court finds that In God We Trust respects an establishment of religion and violates the [Lemon test.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman) Precedent about the phrases supposedly secular presence on money becomes worthless. 2. The court finds it perfectly kosher to plaster religious phrases all over government buildings, including places of learning, and red states proceed to do so with reckless abandon. The liberal mainstream *flips the fuck out* and the ensuing backlash is both sweet and swift. As a result, In God We Trust is finally recognized in general as a naked endorsement of religion and a violation of the first amendment."

In addition, the Postal Service is no longer controlled by Congress. Who they enter into contract with is their business, and Feinstein has no influence over that.

The problem is that Congress is exempt from Obamacare. Which is so hypocritical and unconstitutional. The Congress should be subject to the rules they pass for other citizens. Shame on the Democrats for forcing this asinine bill through.
Obamacare is about getting poor and middle class health insurance. Congress members are neither poor or middle class. Plus they also get the best health insurance in America already. They simply dont need tax credits or subsides to afford to get health insurance. This is the part that people dont hear about. Obamacare helps you to pay for your health insurance if you received it in one of these exchanges. The government already pays 100% of congress health insurances. 
This lie was debunked months ago.
"well, good to hear you like Obamacare now. You know, the same outlets that lied to you and told you Congress was exempt from ACA are the ones you are basing your opinions on. Does that mean anything to you? I know you thought that because thats what conservatives news outlets say but its a complete lie. I hope it opens your eyes to all the other lies they have been pushing on ACA."
"&gt; ?Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, after the effective date of this subtitle, the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and Congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are ? (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an Amendment made by this Act).? Theyre not exempted. "
&gt;The problem is that Congress is exempt from Obamacare. &gt;Which is so hypocritical and unconstitutional. Thats the problem? Do you know what unconstitutional means?

The Government subsidizes their payments; and can get healthcare from the Office of the attending Physician in DC; and can purchase healthcare from military sources as well. To say they are equal with the average American is just a lie.

"Nope. Look it up, it was all over the news, even the lefty networks."
"&gt; The exemption that they voted themselves was forcing them to purchase their insurance through the exchanges was forcing them to participate in a system that is not designed for them. Yeah, the system they are forcing down the throat of millions of Americans. They exempted themselves from it because they know how terrible it is. Im glad you confirmed that my analysis is accurate: the Dems are running from Obamacare just as fast as the Republicans."
"It was all over the news, AND FALSE. [Look it up yourself.](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/05/congress-and-an-exemption-from-obamacare/) &gt;Under the health care law, their insurance coverage will have to switch from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the group of private insurance plans that cover 8 million federal employees and retirees, to the exchanges created by the law. Those exchanges are meant for those who buy coverage on their own, the currently uninsured and small businesses. Members of Congress and their staffs would be the only employees of a large employer in the exchanges, which are set to begin offering insurance in January. So, why is the false ?exempt? claim making the Facebook rounds? There is reportedly concern on Capitol Hill that the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, won?t be able to smoothly transition members and their staffs into an exchange. The concern, as a Roll Call story explained, was that the government wouldn?t be able to make contributions toward the federal employees? premiums, at least at the beginning of 2014. That would mean employees would pick up the whole tab for their insurance policies. Right now, the government pays 72 percent of premiums on average. The ?exempt? claims were sparked by a Politico report on April 24 that said secret talks were being held by lawmakers to change the requirement to get insurance through the exchanges because of this concern. It is not an exemption they were looking for, it was being treated equally under the law to everyone else...and they didnt get it. They are treated differently, but not in the sense that they are exempt."
"The only accurate analysis is that conservatives have no regard for facts or reality. Im done trying to break into your little dream world. Go on believing lies, its not like you matter anyway."
You are fucking stupid. http://www.factcheck.org/2013/08/train-wreck-ad-goes-off-the-rails/
This is just word games. They wouldve had to change their insurance plans -- like tens of millions of Americans will have to -- except they voted themselves an exemption. All these word games you guys are trying to play just makes you look like empty-headed shills.

"Bad news reddit, your boy Obama will hand over the white house to republicans. There always has to be someone to blame for why they couldnt accomplish anything meaningful."
How could that argument be made? The citizenship status of their parents at the time of their births is equivalent.... Neither Cruz nor Obamas fathers were US citizens.
"Its more complicated than that. The law at the time put some residency restrictions on the US parent (something like needing to have lived in the US for at least five years after turning 18. I dont remember the details) and, had Obama been born outside the US, he would not have qualified because of these extra restrictions. Cruz does not have these problems. Also, Obama is visibly black. Cruz is Cuban, but Cubans are basically white folks who tan well, so thats cool."
"Like I said, it is convoluted. Under old citizenship laws there was a residency requirement that Obamas mother had never reached, since she was too young. So while he could immediately have gained citizenship, he wouldnt have been born with it. Ill link the snopes article since they explain it more [clearly](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/citizen.asp)."

"According to [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/apr/22/rachel-maddow/msnbc-host-rachel-maddow-says-texas-routinely-rece/), that was true up until 2003 but since 2003, Texas routinely receives more federal money than it pays in taxes. &gt;Summing up: The figures from our sources show two different trends. On an annual basis between 1981 and 2003, Texas almost always paid more in federal taxes than it got back from Uncle Sam. But since 2003 the reverse has been true, with Texas receiving more than it paid in five out of seven years, which is close to routine. "

"The OPs point about how Obama will respond to these accusations by offering grand high level concepts, but then rarely follow through is something Id like to hear you counter. You say after reading books from insiders you feel he is supporter of debate, but he doesnt do so publicly. It he is so in support of it, why not lead a more public discussion on some of these points, or at least repeatedly urge congress to do so. The pattern with him (that Ive observed) is 1) Major unveiling of problem/controversy. 2) Emotional response promising to get to the bottom of it, find those responsible, etc. 3) do nothing else 4) insist that any commenter who brings up said scandal (usually in reference to nothing having been done publicly) is merely trying to use _____ for political game, then he will brush past the questions/accusation. Look at any if the several recent dust ups. They all follow that pattern. "
"&gt; You say after reading books from insiders you feel he is supporter of debate, but he doesnt do so publicly. It he is so in support of it, why not lead a more public discussion on some of these points, or at least repeatedly urge congress to do so. Why doesnt he debate with the public - like you and me? I dont know, good question. But that fact alone doesnt disprove that he doesnt debate within his inner circle and experts. The books Ive read reach a consensus on this. For example, on drone strikes, he meets with the military folks, the ACLU, he has his liberal counsel [Harold Koh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hongju_Koh), and they discuss the matter. Does he do it for show? I sure dont get that impression. Does he equally satisfy each group? Hell no, but thats impossible to do, especially on such matters. On the NSA issue, both Dianne Feinstein and warhawk Lindsay Graham are aligned. That should immediately make you wonder about the impact of this program. When you get bipartisan support and opposition to something, its going to be complicated. And Obama does urge Congress to act ALL THE TIME. Stimulus, debt ceiling, gun control, immigration, grand bargain, and so on. It falls on deaf ears in the House. &gt; The pattern with him (that Ive observed) is 1) Major unveiling of problem/controversy. 2) Emotional response promising to get to the bottom of it, find those responsible, etc. 3) do nothing else 4) insist that any commenter who brings up said scandal (usually in reference to nothing having been done publicly) is merely trying to use it for political game, then he will brush past the questions/accusation. 1. Okay 2. I dont get this. I mean, I understand he has his get to the bottom of this face complete with the finger wag, but its hardly emotional. Other than his frustration when the gun background check failed in the Senate, he is consistently unemotional. Lets hear an example of this emotional response. And even if it is emotional, does it matter? I just dont see him as an appeal to emotion person. 3. I think the most objective measure I can think of on this is Politifacts [Promise-O-meter](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/). He has a lot of Promises Broken, but a hell of a lot more Promises kept or Compromise. When you say do nothing else what are a few examples you refer to? 4. Agreed, Ive heard him do this also but it does happen. Benghazi, which is hardly a scandal has been presented as one by the right. The IRS thing has been presented as political-based even though there is no evidence that it was other than idiot entry level people and first level management."
"A president is the figurehead of our government. If he wants to be known as someone who invites debate, he should show it through his actions, not his biographers words. Were not going to agree or convince each other of anything. But, you cannot try and excuse both the Benghazi revelations and the IRS situation as things the right is trying to push. The most invasive government agency in the country had employees (both low level all the way to the top at least aware) of decisions based 100% on political motivations. Even if they only separated applications because the low level worker felt the groups including trap party and such were more likely to be denied, they still made decisions on how to process them based on that. They pre judged them. And 9/11/12 was and is a giant scandal that still has yet to be accounted for. On the eve of a presidential election, state department (appointed by the White House) employees made significant alterations to the intelligence statements to distract from the obvious and eventual facts. How far that goes or whos responsible can be debated, but it happened. Its not a fox news story. Its real. And the entire public was made to believe that 4 Americans were killed, and American soil attacked in the name of a YouTube video, while the state department and White House knew that to be false. I cant demonstrate a better example of scandal. "

&gt; Id like to see our government prosecute more people that break the laws we already have in place before enacting more. You need to give examples. Im pretty sure that it wasnt a lack of enforcing existing laws that allowed Adam Lanza and every other high-profile nutcase lately to go on a killing spree. 
I dont think the heinously wealthy would enjoy selling off all of theirs and their families assets/investments in order to run for office. Its also not like senators dont make good money. Increasing their salaries is one way to incentivize the giving up of assets/investments. Why would a wealthy person leave their company making millions in order to make a comparable pittance.
Not everyone who gets into public service bathes in cash. What you are describing would exclude all but the most heinously rich families from participating in that part of democracy. They wouldnt be beholden to the people either.

Why do we subsidize GE? Or GM? Or big farms? Or Google? GE is one of the largest companies in the world and they pay... Zero taxes
"GE is one of the largest companies in the world and they pay... Zero taxes Companies have to pay, in fact MATCH, every dollar employees pay in payroll taxes. That chunk of money you pay out of your check? The company has to match it. Employees are expensive and GE has a lot of them, many of who are highly paid. Plus there are state and local governments who squeeze every dollar they can out of corporations. When does 3 billion globally and 1 billion to the US = zero taxes? As far as corporate incoming taxes? How much money is GE capital dumping into the US government to keep it afloat? Who do you think the US government owes the most money to? China? How about the US corporations who have a vested interest in keeping it from tanking? GE makes the money back by not having a collapsed economy, so they can sell jet engines to the US military and US aviation companies, medical equipment to American hospitals, building new power plants, supplying nuclear reactors to American naval ships... All of which keeps their employees working, who then buy shit so other companies can profit off their wages. http://www.factcheck.org/2012/04/warren-ge-pays-no-taxes/"

" That makes no sense. Companies have an option to treat their workers respectfully. Can you image they would want their workers to be safe from an illness destroying their lives?

But they were deeply involved in the process."
"Yes, for that specific number. I never made any claims about the specific number. Its clearly false to say though that no company is lowering hours/converting full time to part time, when there are so many examples. The exact magnitude can be debated, the effect itself cannot."
"&gt;As shown in the chart below ? using Bureau of Labor Statistics data - the share of full-time workers (in red) has dropped, while the share of part-timers (in blue) has risen. And they make up a greater portion of the American workforce.

FactCheck.org says: False. http://www.factcheck.org/2013/09/obamacare-myths/ TL;DR **This change is very slight and happened before obamacare was even written into law. It is not attributable to the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare.**"
"&gt;That makes no sense. Companies have an option to treat their workers respectfully. Can you image they would want their workers to be safe from an illness destroying their lives? Sure, and they had that same option before. If they didnt choose to do it before, they wont choose to do it now. Again, you seem to be on the naive category. &gt;The ACA was no just a Dem dbill. The Repubs had plenty of input. Bills do not just appear one day. They are fought over in committees before they get to the floor. There are people arguing that since the Repubs did not vote for it all, they had nothing to do with it. That is incorrect. They just voted against it in bloc, like they frequently do. But they were deeply involved in the process. I dont see how this is relevant to what I said except to disperse blame I guess? I dont disagree with what you said, if it makes you feel better. So, to generalize a bit, whoever wrote that portion of the ACA is either naive or stupid. Hows that?"
"&gt;That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers. People respond to incentives. This is undeniably true. So if you design a program that doesnt take that into account, you are either incredibly naive, or stupid. Its your call as to which the ACA is, but regardless, it *is* the problem of the program. In your case, you seem to take the naive route. EDIT: I guess the other option is that this outcome was *intended* by the ACA. I doubt youll argue that though, but for the sake of completeness I guess I should include it as an option."

"[Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/18/chris-van-hollen/van-hollen-says-employer-mandate-affects-5-busines/) has this to say: &gt;According to the Census Bureau, about 72 percent of workers in companies - which is not a complete count of all workers - are in firms with 50 or more employees. Yes, less than 4% of companies have more than 50 employees (the census bureau says 3.6%). Yet, 72% of ALL workers, work for those 3.6% of total businesses. They conclude with this: &gt;However, his claim focuses our attention on the number of firms, which makes the mandate issue look small.

"modernizing process? launching data.gov? I dont think people were talking about getting their hands on traffic statistics APIs when they asked for transparency. Lets see what the right wing hate machine called Huffington Post has to say on it: &gt;the administration has been repeatedly decried for its obsessive insistence on off-the-record and background only conversations with reporters; for its reflexive demand that all official quotes be approved by agency flacks; and for its abysmally slow, unresponsive or militantly piecemeal approach to requests for materials under the federal Freedom of Information Act. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-zeller-jr/obamas-secretive-side-a-b_b_3111699.html Thats just one of the first that pops up when you search Obama transparency. His record has been abysmal, and completely counter to his campaign promises."
"&gt;Well if you actually go back a read Obamas campaign speeches, half of the transparency he specifically references is financial transparency. That was his most-often stated goal as far as open government. This is hair splitting and nuance. If youre parsing campaign speeches for how often financial transparency is mentioned vs. other operational transparency, then youre only goal is damage control for a known failure of the administration. &gt;Surely you dont think the political leanings of a news source validate its content. I thought we were having an intellectually honest discussion and not clouding are opinions with informal fallacies. So focus on the content then, and try to repudiate it, instead of clouding the issue by trying to turn a meta-comment on the fact that it is a non-right wing source into a non-existent fallacy. The only point was that this isnt a foxnews.com talking point. So, please, tell me where HuffingtonPost, or [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/barack-obama-white-house-transparency-101494.html), or [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/barack_obama_promised_transparency_the_white_house_is_as_opaque_secretive.html), or [Columbia Journalism Review](http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/cjp_report_on_us_press_freedom.php), or [Miami Herald](http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/01/15/3870483/us-spy-agencys-push-for-secrecy.html) are all wrong on their scathing reviews of the transparency of this administration. &gt;Maybe instead of making sweeping statements, you should go through the bullet points. Based on politifact, Obama has kept roughly 1/3 of his promises regarding transparency, compromised on 1/3, and failed to act on 1/3. Maybe turning a complex discussion into a rough count of how many items fall into each category does a shit job of illustrating the success or failure of the administration to provide transparency. Why the fuck would you equate Help students and their families become aware of college readiness on the same scale as Seek independent watchdog agency to investigate congressional ethics violations, and why do either of those have anything to do with the transparency of the administration? They are both having to do with transparency of completely different organizations. The politifact metric is yet another bullshit tactic to avoid discussing the reality of the problem. Youre a shill for the administration, and need to own up to that. "

"They dont get kick backs for hiring handicap people. They just get strong backs and weak minds, exactly like they want. The subsidies they are talking about is the fact that walmart will help you apply for medicare and food stamps while giving you only 30 hour work weeks at bare bones stagnated minimum wage. You NEED these programs to be able to afford to work at fucking walmart. The only reason they can pay their employees (even the retarded ones) so little is because our tax money fills the massive void. Their business model is propped up by the welfare system."
"&gt; What are we talking about here? what percent of their employees also draw welfare (how many) and how much? Granted the company has 1.3 million U.S. employees, but [the number receiving assistance is not insignificant](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/dec/06/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-more-walmart-employees-medicaid-/). As for minimum wage: [The company has 1.3 million U.S. employees, and about 4,000 of them currently make either a state or federal minimum wage, Tovar said.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-19/wal-mart-says-looking-at-support-of-federal-minimum-wage-rise.html) So only about 0.3% of their American workforce makes minimum wage. "
Thanks for the numbers. Im still curious to hear what the story is behind the likely subsidies they get for special needs employees which might make up the majority of those numbers.
"OK, real question. What are we talking about here? what percent of their employees also draw welfare (how many) and how much? The reason I pose this question is that as much as I hate Walmart and will go to great lengths to avoid shopping there, I have been there. Every time Ive been there Ive crossed paths with employees working the aisles that were clearly special needs. Once I asked one of them a question and he ran off screaming. Not to be a jerk by stating the obvious, but these employees are clearly not equal quality to a normal minimum wage employee so Im guessing WM receives something for giving special needs people jobs (I dont know, just guessing) and is that what were talking about here?"
"I believe I read that around 75% of Walmart employees are on some form of government aid (welfare, food stamps etc). With the amount of money they make in profit each year its a disgrace that they have employees that are not able to put food on the table for their families. "

"60% of bankruptcies involved medical bills, and 75% of those the person had health insurance. In a sense, 35% of all bankruptcies are due to bad coverage, which is the single largest cause of bankruptcy by a large margin.

The tax payer is who pays for medical bankruptcy. "
"&gt; 60% of bankruptcies involved medical bills, and 75% of those the person had health insurance. Ive seen this statistics a fair bit, where did you get it? Id like to read more about it. I found something related to the [50%+ number](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/12/health-care-bill-bankruptcies/) that was thrown around during the original debate but apparently that statistic was from self-reported sources and included income loss from sickness. One of the critiques found something that may be interesting: Buried in the study is the fact that only **27 percent of the surveyed debtors had unreimbursed medical expenses exceeding $1,000** over the course of the two years prior to their bankruptcy. ? Nobody likes to pay $1,000 in medical expenses even when they get two years to do it in, but for most Americans (particularly those with enough at stake to seek the protection of bankruptcy) it is not catastrophic.

Did you practice effective interviewing techniques? If you did not get very many interviews, it probably has to do with your resume. Did you get advice from as many people that you could on ways to beef up your resume? Cold-calling helps too; literally cold-call an HR department and/or recruiter. These people love persistence. Find a company you want to work for, then find an employee with some say there. Figure out what their email address is, and send it off. Repeat until a fish bites. Idk what else to say.

False. Although I wish he had said it. http://www.snopes.com/quotes/lincoln.asp
"This guy wrote a paper(http://www.ratical.org/corporations/Lincoln.html) at UC Davis in the early 90s documenting all of his sources and making a strong case for it.

Can you link me to a source please? Snopes factcheck says that his Secretary said this but where is it documented? Im not saying your wrong. I may very well be wrong and I apologize if I am."
"I think Lincoln put it nicely long ago after seeing what corporations can do to our political and legal system &gt;?I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. . . . corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.? &gt;?U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, Nov. 21, 1864"

"This might be an easier read: http://www.factcheck.org/2009/08/health-care-for-members-of-congress/ While they do have to pay and its the same coverage they also get free outpatient access to military hospitals, and can even be seen by the presidents physicians for about $500/yr; and their coverage is partly subsidized beyond the simple Employer/Employee setup.

"&gt;Republicans support tax cuts for everyone. Unless theyre busy claiming that 50% of people pay no taxes, and [fighting to end a temporary cut in the taxes that the lower classes actually do pay](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/27/hey-america-republicans-want-to-raise-your-taxes/). &gt;So yes, Democrats want to raise some taxes. But so do Republicans. They want to let the payroll tax cut and the various stimulus tax credits (notably the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit) expire. Those are the tax cuts that primarily help poor and middle-class Americans. In fact, 87.8 percent of the payroll tax cuts benefits go to taxpayers making less than $200,000 and 99.9 percent of the stimulus tax credits benefits go to taxpayers making less than $200,000. "
"&gt; Unless theyre busy claiming that 50% of people pay no taxes Its more than just a claim. [Its true](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/08/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-51-percent-american-households-pa/), in the case of [federal income taxes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-47-percent-americans-pay-no-income-tax/). &gt; fighting to end a temporary cut in the taxes that the lower classes actually do pay Thats an over-simplification, which boils down to a lie. In 2011, both parties wanted to keep the tax cuts, [the difference was over how to pay for it](http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/01/politics/congress-payroll-tax-cut/index.html). &gt; The price tag of the bill is about $265 billion, which would be paid for by the 3.25% surtax on annual income above $1 million, according to Democratic aides. Note that the plan was a 1 year payroll tax cut extension for a permanent tax hike, which was a nonstarter for Republicans. &gt; Meanwhile, the Senate Republican plan that also was blocked would continue the 4.2% payroll tax rate for a year and pay for it by imposing a three-year freeze on federal salaries and reducing the federal work force by 10% through replacing workers when they quit or retire. In addition, the plan would require Americans earning $750,000 a year or more to pay higher premiums for Medicare, and prevent millionaires from getting food stamps or unemployment compensation. They ultimately voted to [extend the cuts for two months](http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/22/politics/congress-payroll-tax-cut/), then [for a year](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/17/us-usa-taxes-payroll-idUSTRE81D1WM20120217). As far as I can tell, neither party was particularly keen on extending the temporary tax cut again. In September of last year, [Nancy Pelosi wanted the payroll tax cuts to expire](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/nancy-pelosi-payroll-tax-cut_n_1904838.html). In President Obamas reelection tax plan, he [wanted the payroll tax cut to expire](http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2012/10/25/what-is-barack-obamas-tax-plan/). The Presidents fiscal cliff proposal did include plans for extending the cut, but that was a farce, to provide a talking point against Republicans. As evidence of that, [the bill](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR00008:@@@S) never included any language to extend the payroll tax cut, not even a failed amendment. I also couldnt find anything to do with the payroll tax extension in any related House or Senate bills. As the final evidence of that, [Chris Hayes said](http://www.mrctv.org/videos/journolisters-klein-and-hayes-reveal-record-wh-briefing-detailing-pr-tax-strategy) in a conversation with Ezra Klein (the author of the article you linked) that the White House was willing to let the payroll tax cuts expire. Considering the payroll tax funds Social Security, it makes sense that the President and Pelosi would want the tax holiday to expire."
"You are absolutely delusional. Politifact currently has and has always had a severe bias toward the left. See the recent Harry Reid gem where in the writeup itself they say yeah, he was wrong, and then go on to rate his statement mostly true."
"Yet they also rated Charles Kochs [editorial in the WSJ](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/04/charles-koch/epa-koch-brothers-business-environment/) Mostly False, even though he was claiming that not only were they an environmentally conscious company, they were such a model for other companies that they had been *given awards* for their environmentalism. Even though it was such a massive embellishment on the truth (they basically got a participation award in a single instance), and even though one of their leaking pipelines exploded, killing two teenagers, his rating was still Mostly False (even though theyre pretty much the exact opposite of what he was claiming). So it cracks me up how you conservatives still like to pretend that theyre liberally biased."

At American Pioneer he was merely an investor as well. Granted, it was his father- in-laws business but he wasnt part of the management.

"Hes pretty shady. His involvement with Global Crossing is pretty fishy. His involvement in American Pioneer is questionable. His business connections and his loans to prominent politicians is questionable. He was pretty dishonest about why Greentech choose its site in Mississippi as opposed to Virginia.

&gt; criticized for keeping too many of his campaign promises This is the part I have no recollection of. I have never heard of a politician being criticized for keeping promises. Do you have any link or sources that mention this criticism?
A shorter list would be promises he kept. 
"Theres quite a long list of promises that hes kept. He actually kept his Net Neutrality promise too, as his FCC appointees voted for full Net Neutrality. However, Verizon took the rules to court and Verizon won in the liberal DC appeals court. There is nothing more President Obama can do for Net Neutrality. The only way forward was given by the court, and that is common carrier, but that is a non-starter in this congress. "

"And [here](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/) is that list. Youll notice that hes kept twice as many promises as hes broken.

You know what really blows my mind is that people are surprised by this. The cold hard truth is that politicians will say whatever they need to to get into office then do whatever theyre paid to. These things rarely overlap. Its a shitty shitty way to run a country that leaves anyone without millions of dollars out in the rain but its the society we live in.
Because ... politicians tell the truth where youre from?

"Weird, story has 3000 upvotes but all Im seeing is thousnads of comments eith 1 upvote, is this an alien blue bug or some weird hack?"
*invested* LOL Your Social Security payments doesnt get invested in anything. It goes to the fund which pays retirees today. Right now.
"As a young person that has been working since theyre 16 (now 23), I just feel cheated. Social Security is a system that is going to collapse and everyone knows it, so Im getting money taken out of my check every two weeks for something Im more than likely not going to enjoy. Even though I agree social welfare programs are great for society (I know SS isnt a social welfare program but Im putting them all together, deal with it), economist have known far and wide that the main problem with such programs is free riding. Thats exactly what we have in this society nowadays, and I specifically direct that towards my age group, people who are just pissed off because TV and their parents told them they were special, and now when it doesnt happen, somehow they feel entitled to greatness but arent willing to put the work. Anyways, you said it pretty well, everything about social security is a mess and it accounts for over 20% of the federal budget. Its something royally fucked up by politicians and I look forward to hearing their bullshit excuses."
"Id love the option to opt out, but to libs, thats just outrageous and sending me to my death. Sorry. Ill gladly invest my own money and take my own risks. If I dont have money for retirement, Im not going to blame the government. Plus, if I was penniless at retirement, Im not expected to survive off of SS anyway."
Did I miss something? Whos talking about eliminating Social Security?
"Theyre not investing it conservatively, theyre lending it to themselves through bond purchasing. And thanks to the Feds money machine, you get way less back in the end when you factor inflation."
"&gt;Theyre taking money from us and investing it (very conservatively). Then, theyve borrowed from that money year after year after year. Now, theres nothing but IOUs The investments are in Treasury bonds. Perhaps the most conservative investment in the world. There is no stealing from the trust fund, the fund is simply invested into US debt, which essentially means that it is helping finance US spending. If that is stealing, then the bond market and other debt markets have been one giant scam for hundreds of years."
"off-topic, but where were you raised? Ive never heard the term land up before but think its pretty nifty."
Your assumptions are all wrong and that makes you an idiot with a stupid post.
"What would you have them do? Put it in a bank account and leave it there doing nothing? That would have the same effect as burning the money and printing it again later. You cant eat dollar bills, after all. At this scale, savings is impossible."
Youre a fool if you think the money youre putting into social security is invested at all and is earning income. It is simply stolen and sent to the thieves in Washington to promptly be used for some other program that needs money. 
Its not being invested at all
Social security is not an investment program. People getting their checks is not dependent on any portfolio making returns. Social security is a program created to prevent poverty in old age and disability.
"Thats the thing I never understand. I didnt *earn* social security. This is my money that was collected and invested. Now granted, Ill assume that the money is invested in a very safe manner and is probably only earning 2% interest or some crap like that. Therefore Im sure there are those that land up taking out more than they put in, especially for those who land up living a long time. But some make it seem this is some gift given to me. Anytime a politician talks about eliminating the entitlement program of social security, I say, fine. Let me do some quick math. Assuming the money that Ive put in has earned 3% interest, in the 17 years Ive been working since graduating from college, my contribution should be up to $111,831.47. Cut a check for me in that amount (and cut a check for everyone else in the amount you owe them as well) then you can cancel this entitlement program. Theyre fucking scam artists. They want to make us think theyre doing us a favor. Theyre not. Theyre taking money from us and investing it (very conservatively). Then, theyve borrowed from that money year after year after year. Now, theres nothing but IOUs. So now theyre trying somehow to get from underneath their obligations. Theyre scum."
Social security is not an investment. It is an insurance program. Payments to that insurance are premiums. You dont have a balance in an account. 
"&gt; Ill assume that the money is invested in a very safe manner The money is spent as as it is received and it is replaced in the SS fund with govt IOUs whose market value is zero. Technically speaking, thats neither an investment nor safe."
"Wait, you think they are saving your money for you and investing it? How amusing. That was the promise, but not the reality. Your money (and mine) goes into a general fund from which claims are paid. Our ability to get payments on our investment is ENTIRELY dependent on other people being there to pay in when we get to retirement age. By that time, the terms will VERY likely have changed significantly, including a later retirement age, decreased benefits and/or income caps (if you make more than $xxx,000 per year, you are responsible for your own retirement and are not entitled to any income from your investment. "
"&gt; Thats the thing I never understand. I didnt earn social security. This is my money that was collected and invested. This is false. The money was collected, but it was not invested. It was transferred to someone else. In order to for you to receive money back from the system, they will have to collect it from someone down the line. Chances are those people havent even been born yet. Its a meaningful distinction, because if it were an actual investment account, youd get a lot more back than what social security can offer."
"&gt; I say, fine. Let me do some quick math. Assuming the money that Ive put in has earned 3% interest, in the 17 years Ive been working since graduating from college, my contribution should be up to $111,831.47. Cut a check for me in that amount (and cut a check for everyone else in the amount you owe them as well) then you can cancel this entitlement program. Id say just give me what I put in, you can keep the interest. "
Your SS payments are not Invested. They are used to pay out current benefits.
&gt; This is my money that was collected and ~~invested~~ spent into oblivion. ftfy 
"No you didnt earn your social security, at least not all of it. The overall benefit you receive is greater than overall tax you pay + 2% interest rate. When politicians talk about reducing entititlement, they are talking about reducing the net benefit (payment - (tax+interest)). I support social security because of the overall benefit it brings to the society, but lets not delude ourselves that people earned all of their social security. By the way, source here http://www.urban.org/publications/900746.html "
"According to the institute?s data, a two-earner couple receiving an average wage ? $44,600 per spouse in 2012 dollars ? and turning 65 in 2010 would have paid $722,000 into Social Security and Medicare and can be expected to take out $966,000 in benefits. So, this couple will be paid about one-third more in benefits than they paid in taxes. If a similar couple had retired in 1980, they would have gotten back almost three times what they put in. And if they had retired in 1960, they would have gotten back more than eight times what they paid in. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/01/medicare-and-social-security-what-you-paid-what-yo/"
"SS was a good thing until Johnson decided to dive into it to fund Vietnam. ever since then the gov has used it as a source of income. I agree with you, go ahead cut it but GIVE ME MY Money back, scumbag!"
"&gt; Theyre taking money from us and investing it (very conservatively). Theyre not doing this, which is precisely the problem. Sometime in the last couple of decades some politicians said HEY LOOK! Theres a bunch of money in this SS trust thing. Lets raid it and spend it on pet projects, and that way well get reelected in 4 years! Then some other politician a couple of decades from now will have to deal with it! But not us! Huzzah!"
"&gt; Theyre taking money from us and investing it (very conservatively). Then, theyve borrowed from that money year after year after year. So why do we trust the government to run programs like this?"

Well said
"Something to consider is that, with traditional investments, you are slowly taking money out of your nest-egg when you retire, so the returns on that money start going down. With SS, the payments slowly go up. I find it to be a great investment."
"The first sentence of your first paragraph outlines the ideological understanding of the Social Security program. As a nation and society, we MUST protect our most vulnerable citizens---especially the elderly, who have contributed their lives to our society, and we must also protect our children who exist within our society out of pure circumstance. This is not to say that all other groups of vulnerable people are not deserving of social safety. ALL HUMAN BEINGS deserve protection, regardless of the opinions of the opulent masters. In our time of winner take all, profit over people corporate institutions, and amazing wealth of the ruling class, the very least you owe society is charity. Without charity, your success is nothing, and will not endure. Everything after the first sentence of your post is moot without understanding the will of the people to support government programs that we believe keep society strong."
"The problem is that a lot of the social security fund is invested in US treasury bonds, money the government doesnt like paying back to the fund. Getting rid of social security is a wet dream of people who want to decrease the federal debt because it would get rid of something like 20% of US debt."
"You guys payed into that ss fund. Then you decided to elect officials who borrowed money from that fund. So because your generation decided to spend some of its ss fund, now you expect MY generation to pay for YOU! Fuck that. I hope they reduce the fuck out of your benefits. Greedy fucking baby boomers..."
"No, you just have no idea what you are talking about. Social Security has many programs. Retirement is one of them and it is not an entitlement, you worked for that. When you hear people Bitch about stopping the entitlement they are talking about SSI. People who have never worked a day in their miserable lives can go to the ssa office and claim a disability and apply and start collecting SSI even before the disability claim is processed and even if it is denied they can just appeal and refile over and over collecting the whole time. Except most get accepted... All they say is I dropped out of school and I cant read or I have anger issues and cant work for a boss or anything else they want to make up and boom free money free healthcare free housing. Guess who pays for it...... Edit...spelling typing on phone...."
"The problem is that, once you retire, you will take (on average) far more out of Social Security and especially Medicare than you put in. "
"&gt; This is my money that was collected and invested Technically its some younger persons money, yours was already spent on the generation of seniors that preceded you."
Wow. That was beautiful. 
OUr money is paying for the previous generations checks. This whole program is running on empty and money we just keep printing.
"&gt; Now granted, Ill assume that the money is invested in a very safe manner and is probably only earning 2% interest or some crap like that. It wasnt invested, it was paid out to retirees. "
The governemt owes you money? I like that Idea. How about you are exempt from taxation untill the debt to you is payed? What would happen if everyone that payd SS was exempt from taxation?
&gt; very safe manner and is probably only earning 2% interest This just doesnt exist today.
"The thing is, the people who are in control of SS did not invest smartly, so they lost money, and now when it comes time to pay the people back who put into it, theyre backing off and saying we should cut social security."
Social security is not running on ious. 
"This is what always bothers me. I have been working since I was 14 years old, getting a pay check, paying into taxes.... If this program is cancelled, am I going to get all my retirement funds back? This is a serious question that Im hoping someone could shed some light on. "
"cost of healthcare has risen for me personally and people i know (cost of insurance + higher deductibles, taxes on hospital equipment+ not being able to see the specialist doctor if i took the obamacare plan (as he is not in the coverage of it) For those who think this is what real conservatives were pitching years ago, you are wrong, first of all no Required mandate, and no subsidizing. secondly, i agree we need to make a change, so get the gov Bureaucracy out of it, the reason we are so fucked up to start with is because we basically have 50 mini monopolys for each states health insurance exchange.. open those lines up and costs will go down.. competition will fix this.. the reason it was fucked up is because health companies were allowed to lobby politicians to close state lines and drive up costs.. to line the politicans pockets and the insurance companies "
"You are being fooled by the whole competition state law bullshit. If you open up sales across states lines you will just start a race to the bottom. Do you know why all the credit card companies are pretty much all located in one state, it because that state has the laxest rules and regulations. Open up state laws and all the insurance companies will move to whatever state will let them sell worthless insurance and they will do just that. States have enacted individual health insurance laws because the insurance companies were just fucking their customers. If we had a better set of federal rules, they are much better now, but still favor the insurance companies more than they should, it might could work better, but that is why the insurance companies want to sell across state lines is to get out of certain states laws that actually require them to provide coverage and not just take your money. You will get cheaper rates sure, but do you really want the lack of coverage??"
"Except that several area of health care (I wont go so far as to say all) are set up in a way that is uncompetitive, you dont get to choose what hospital to go to therefor there is no incentive to keep cost down, and on top of that in this current system there is a incentive towards reactive care, while preventative care is dis incentivized. I am all for competition, but you have to set it up in a framework that allows for it, as right now if you could pull it off without being caught there is a strong incentive to get your clients sick again and again"
"&gt;secondly, i agree we need to make a change, so get the gov Bureaucracy out of it, the reason we are so fucked up to start with is because we basically have 50 mini monopolys for each states health insurance exchange.. open those lines up and costs will go down.. competition will fix this.. the reason it was fucked up is because health companies were allowed to lobby politicians to close state lines and drive up costs.. to line the politicans pockets and the insurance companies Yes, there was just too much regulation in health care before. That was the problem. The free market would have solved all of our problems."
"Correct me if im wrong, but isnt the point of an exchange to provide a range of options? How is that a monopoly?"
"You said: &gt;For those who think this is what real conservatives were pitching years ago, you are wrong, first of all no Required mandate, and no subsidizing. In reply I offer this, &gt;In 1993, when the Clinton administration was trying to pass health care reform, Gingrich appeared on NBC?s Meet the Press and addressed the individual mandate. &gt;I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and **being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance.** &gt;He went on to criticize Clinton?s plan as destructively big-government. But he also said, I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that.

FactCheck.org says: False. http://www.factcheck.org/2013/09/obamacare-myths/ TL;DR **This change is very slight and happened before obamacare was even written into law. It is not attributable to the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare.**"
"&gt; That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, No, its a problem of the program. People making rational financial choices based upon economic pressures created by legislation is what you would expect people to do. If ACA was relying on employers making dumb financial decisions, then thats a HUGE problem with ACA. "
"Agreed. Everything looks at walmart and thinks its people like them that are screwing over their employees to pocket millions in profits. A friends girlfriend works at a deli. The owner has 3 locations. He often puts in 80+ hours himself. Hes no where near rich. Due to his number of employees, he was going to have to offer health insurance. He can not afford it. He legally sold the largest store to his wife, thus neither of them have over the limit of employees, thus they are now in the clear. "
"So even though McCain took public financing, the only way for Obama to win was to reject public financing, break his promise, and beg and claw for as much cash as possible?"
McCain qualified and Obama did not. http://www.factcheck.org/2008/06/mccain-and-public-financing/
"&gt;Then they called it the 2013 lie of the year. Right. They called it the lie of the year because, as I said, it was a central focus of Obamas pitch of Obamacare to the American public, and the HHS rules for retaining grandfathered plans (which were implemented after the earlier reviews) were so restrictive that most plans could not remain grandfathered, and HHS knew most plans would not remain grandfathered. &gt;People are losing plans because insurance companies chose to cancel them, whether they were ACA compliant or not. Right, but most of the cancelled plans were cancelled because they would shortly no longer be considered qualified plans. The way youre stating it is as if insurers simply said we dont want to take your money anymore which is not even remotely the case. HHS knew their rules were prohibitively restrictive and they counted on it: &gt;We note that, as the Affordable Care Act is implemented, we expect grandfathered coverage to diminish, particularly in the individual market &gt;They didnt have to. There was a long transition period Right, and the rules were in place since 2010 . . . so cancelling plans in 2012/2013 is well into the transitional period. Even if they didnt wait until the last minute, its not as if insurers were clamoring to cancel plans. The vast majority waited to cancel until the marketplaces were open and people could use them to buy new insurance because they were not allowed to keep their existing plan."
Yes. Bush lied too.
"President George W. Bush, in the 2003 State of the Union address, uttered the infamous 16 words: **The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.** U.N. inspectors documented and safeguarded the yellowcake, which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 Gulf War.** There was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991, the official said.** G. W. Bush lied about yellowcake uranium to start a several trillion dollar war. **Please, you arent outraged about lying, you are outraged at a democratic president.** http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/yellowcake.asp"
"&gt; You cant pretend this wasnt a primary point Obama made, though. Which was true enough. In fact, it is true enough that politifact rated the claim half true! http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-under-his-health-care-law-those-/ Then they called it the 2013 lie of the year. &gt; The whole point of this whole ACA mess was to let people who currently have and enjoy their insurance to keep their insurance situation the same. Which is close enough to the truth. People are losing plans because insurance companies chose to cancel them, whether they were ACA compliant or not. They didnt have to. There was a long transition period *before* the right wing screaming started. This is a pointless argument."
"You cant pretend this wasnt a primary point Obama made, though. Obama came in front of the American people and tried to spell out the ACA as clearly and simply as he could: if you like your insurance, you can keep it . . . if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor (paraphrased). The whole point of this whole ACA mess was to let people who currently have and enjoy their insurance to keep their insurance situation the same. This was reiterated just a couple months ago on the Daily Show when the HHS director said (in response to the question of why not single payer) that Obamas focus was to let people keep their insurance if they wanted to."
"Source? I know many racists who never use the term subhuman mongrel. Hell, I dare say most people are racist, and yet that term is pretty rare."
"Most racists would not use the words subhuman mongrel, but subhuman mongrel is usually used by racists. Not your casual racist that you would meet on the street, but, like, the super-dedicated KKK/Stormfront white supremacist kind of racist. http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/18/wolf-blitzer/wolf-blitzer-ted-nugent-used-nazi-terminology-subh/ http://blog.dictionary.com/mongrel-race/ http://paulmoffett.blogspot.com/2006/09/hybrids-mongrels-and-half-breeds.html"

"Im not disagreeing with you, but wed certainly expect to see more jobs created after a recession, right? It would kind of be really bad news to if your claim wasnt true."
"Until you post a source youre just spreading more speculative bullshit. Using [this](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3788365/) source it does indeed say 75% are part time, but that once employers are more sure about Obamacare and the effects it will have they will be turned into full-time jobs. So whose fault is it theyre part-time? Employers. Not to mention, part time employment is better than unemployed. Leave it to the republican circle jerkers to go from bitching about unemployment to part-time employment. Theres not exactly a shortage of jobs, just qualified or ambitious enough people. I found a job right out of college, full time. Dont be a dumbass and major in art history or psychology and youll be fine. Otherwise, theres always oil rigs."
You people really are brainwashed . . . It doesnt matter if 2.5 million jobs were created if 3.6 million jobs were destroyed. http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/ali-meyer/1154000-fewer-americans-working-today-6-years-ago
Gotta love those sweet sweet part time jobs! 
"This says [otherwise](http://i.imgur.com/JEx0Fhh.png). Kidding, factcheck.org is about as clean as it gets."
"Unemployment in that model is 6.6%, which is only .6 more than the global average of 6%. Do you even read the shit you post? Meaning, only 10.5m of that 155m figure are considered unemployed because the others have given up looking, are students, or whatever reason where theyre not in the labor force."
"The GOP absolutely predicted that the ACA would lead to people losing their plans they had or at least that the plans would become drastically more expensive once the ACA kicked in. [Here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2012/03/22/how-obamacare-dramatically-increases-the-cost-of-insurance-for-young-workers/) is an article from March of 2012 that pretty much predicts what we are seeing regarding the costs. I dont think its too much of a logical jump to say that this goes against the idea of If you like your plan, you can keep it. Period I guess you could try to squirm out of it and say that he thought you could keep your plan, it would just be priced out of reach, but Obama also said that The average family of 4 will save $2500 per year due to the ACA, which has also proven to be a lie in many cases. The combination of these lies make it pretty difficult for folks like you to spin your way out of it. Edit: I actaully went back and found a Politifact [article](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/barack-obama/obamas-plan-expands-existing-system/) from October 2008 where they rate the Lie of the Year for 2013 as bury the needle true. Not only does he say that if you like your plan you can keep it, he also goes on to say that the ACA will also lower the premiums on those plans. There is no way to spin out of this. Own it. "
"As a liberal, and somewhat a great spinner in my own right, I honestly believe he knew. The inner dialogue goes like this (so that he can say it and honestly believe it): 1. If people want to keep their plans, they can keep it. 2. People wont want to keep plans that are barebones and incapable of preventing them from having a huge loss in the case that they have a real emergency, because people are more rational/practical than that, and if shown facts and reason they will want a plan that covers their needs than a theater of security. 3. So, because people wont want to keep the crappy plans, due to reason #2, reason #1 is truthful. *Now* - just because they reason it this way doesnt mean it is, in reality, true. People were fine with the plans, probably because they didnt know any better. But they were still happy with their plans and would have only have complained if they got legitimately sick and found out where the coverage ended. That happened quietly to too many people, and the ACA aims to stop that, but when people dont realize the limitations due to the intensely convoluted wording in the brokered agreements they liked their plans. So, in reality, it is quite a bit of a lie at best, and an intentional deception at worst. I still think there are plenty of other lies told by the administration that could have been used though."
"&gt;You cant honestly believe Just use a little common sense. You would have to be an idiot to think Obama had secret information that the GOP didnt have. _Obama knew exactly the same information that the GOP knew about the ACA_, and if the GOP had foreseen the cancellations they would have made it a central issue from the start. The GOP did not foresee what happened. Obama did not foresee what happened. "

"Keep your own insurance Yes, you can keep your own insurance, provided it complies with ACA regulations, including how much of the premiums actually go towards healthcare coverage and not overhead. close down Gitmo He signed the executive order. It would have been closed if Republicans and some Democrats in Congress did not push back by refusing to move Guantanamo prisoners to prisons inside the country, among other reasons.

"This all reads like someone that either didnt really read up on what Obama was promising, or just someone that wants to give the old I totally supported him, but I am going to vote libertarian in the next election! The majority of things youve pointed out either was done, was stalled by a congress that (same as right now) refuse to cooperate with Democrats on fucking *anything*, or was never actually promised but accepted by truth because the Right Wing media portray it as absolute fact with a look how Obama has failed!!! &gt;TARP. No Bankers Jailed. (nuff said). [TARP was signed into law by Bush **and not** Obama](http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/was-tarp-passed-under-bush-or-obama/), and what specific laws did bankers actually break? (Unfortunately for us, dont be an asshole is not a law) &gt;Immediate end to Iraq war and drawdown in Af/Pak You cannot just pull thousands and thousands of troops out of a country without some kind of timetable in place - a timetable that was actually set by Bush in the [2008 US-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%E2%80%93Iraq_Status_of_Forces_Agreement). As for Afghanistan/Pakistan, President Obama actually campaigned on [stepping up those engagements](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/134/send-two-additional-brigades-to-afghanistan/) when he ran... so you are admitting that you originally voted for a man without (apparently) knowing what he was campaigning on. &gt;Ending Torture He [did end torture](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/175/end-the-use-of-torture/) (as far as we know). &gt;Green energy, stimulus, technology, etc. -&gt; These programs were funded to less than 10% of what was proposed, and had to cut ugly, ugly deals with the energy industry - resulting in BP Gulf Disaster, and Keystone. The president doesnt have carte blanche power to enact any kind of spending or tax credit he wants - the proposal that would have done what he promised was stopped by house republicans, something you really cant blame the President for. &gt;Single-Payer healthcare Like the green energy jobs above, this was also heavily edited by congressional republicans. &gt;End the drug war IIRC, there was no promise to end the drug war, but to treat drug addiction as a health problem, something that goes/went into effect with the PPACA. "
"That all said, I still think Obama looks bad. I voted for him in 2008, because I thought he was going to make some changes. As it turned out, he either didnt have the will, or the power, to do anything substantial. (I am actually really happy for the gays though - congratulations you guys). I LITERALLY did not vote for him in 2012 because of how little of his previous progressive agenda he actually accomplished. Lets look at a list of things he did that were very much in opposition to his 2008 primary platform: 1. Financial/Banking reform -&gt; TARP. No Bankers Jailed. (nuff said). 2. Immediate end to Iraq war and drawdown in Af/Pak. -&gt; we still have tens of thousands of State Dept contractors in Iraq. Still troops in Af/Pak. + Libya, Yemen, Somalia, we narrowly avoided having to go into Syria. Seriously - fuck all this war shit. 3. Ending Torture. -&gt; Immunity from prosecution for Bush and Cheney. 4. Green energy, stimulus, technology, etc. -&gt; These programs were funded to less than 10% of what was proposed, and had to cut ugly, ugly deals with the energy industry - resulting in BP Gulf Disaster, and Keystone. 5. Single-Payer healthcare (distinctly different from Clintons Private Insurance Mandate plan) -&gt; we got Hillarys fucked up plan. 6. End the drug war. -&gt; ended up with: dialed-back fighting states in drug-war-rebellion. I dont know if 2014 is going to bring dems to the polls. And it sure doesnt matter if people want to vote for Obama in 2016. But progressives have really gotten nothing but the shaft from him."
"Your list of issues include items passed before his election day, let alone his inauguration (TARP), but assumes items could be done just because he wanted it without support from the senate republicans (Green Energy stimulus/single payer). If you add to it that you referenced the Heritage Foundation plan as Hilarys, then I have only one way to view your post. Uninformed trolling is still trolling. EDIT: werds "
The best governments are the ones who govern the least.
"The thing is, when they get productive its even worse than when they are not productive. Our country is so fucked."
"Why is passing a bill a metric for how successful they are? If we had a perfect system (which we obviously dont) would we still still say they were not productive because they didnt pass something? For the right, who is supposed to be for small government this could be considered the most productive/obstructive congress. Just sayin."
So a good Congress is that which passes more bills? Does the content matter or just the sheer number? 
"How much you want to bet republicans will say, Obama has signed the fewest bills in history!"
"If all of these politicians that gripe about government overspending fought to end their own jobs, Id be impressed."
"Surely when people began keeping track of these things was the *first* Congress, active 1789-1791. It appears they passed half a dozen laws and one constitutional amendment. In two years. Get your shit together, Washington Post. "
[Ron Swanson would be proud.](http://imgur.com/fZZgih0)
"And MORE bills is the answer?!? This is very good news for those concerned with the threat of expansive and oppressive governments. You cannot ignore historically that many, if not all, oppressive governments have committed the largest atrocities this world has ever seen. "
Yeah guys you know what we really need? Moar laws! 
"I like how the title talks about how Congress has been very counter-productive, which it has been. It then proceeds to forget how a bi-cameral system works by mentioning that the House has passed just 22 bills that have been sent to President Obama. I believe you meant to say, the House **and the Senate** have passed just 22 bills that have been sent to President Obama."
"Its not how many that matters. It is what that is passed. However, the bills are more likely to consist of half-assed band aids just so these morons can say We Did It! like little kids. Welcome to Washington."
"113th is pretty bad, but they dont even come close to the 110th. "
"How will civilization endure unless Congress passes laws? I so scared, you guise."
"The House being the problem there. The last 68 times we voted to repeal Obamacare failed, but THIS TIME..."

Through the first 8 months of 2013, the House has passed just 22 bills that have been sent to President Obama. That?s the smallest number of passed bills since people began keeping track of these things "
Can we maybe stop judging the productivity of the legislative body by the number of laws they pass? Overlegislation comes from that shit.
"Bad headline. Its a very bad idea to gauge productivity of Congress by the number of bills (ie new laws) they pass. I think it would be more disruptive to society if there was an ever annual increase to the number of bills passed, since society would not be able to keep up with them "
Who needs more laws? I think they are doing better. 
"Given the place is controlled buy the GOP that just want to fuck shit up (and have openly said so) this isnt a bad thing at all. How many laws of we really REQUIRE Congress to pass for the country to run. GOP promised distracted, less effective legislature and delivered! Now if they would return half their paychecks for not doing snu work, wed be all set. "
TIL that more bills = better govt. Whodathunk it would be that simple?
why is not passing new legislation considered bad?
"Much as Id like to fault Boehner for a lot of stuff, a bill needs to pass *both* House and Senate to get to Obamas desk. So an absolute count says nothing more than Boenher and Reid disagree. A better metric would be to compare the ratio of bills reaching Obama to total bills passed for both House and Senate. That would give a much clearer measure of playing well with others. "
"what was the last bill that they passed that wasnt either oppressive, pork laiden, or otherwise destructive and dishonest? hell, the people would be better off if they never came back into session, at this point."
No bill is better than Bad bill
"And yet Boehner will still go on TV and bash Obamas approval rating and using it as evidence that he is the one holding the country back. Sorry little orange man, but what is congress approval rating at today? 17%?"
"Heavily GOP controlled House vs heavily Democratic controlled Senate. Who didnt see this coming? Since neither side seems to be too concerned with individual liberty, a stalemate is the best I can hope for."
"They all need to be fired. Anyone who wants the position needs to satisfy certain prerequisites like being a chemical engineer, marine biologist, etc. to show they have the high intelligence necessary to make decisions that affect the well being of millions of Americans. "
Good. 
&gt;This is the least productive Congress ever Couldnt even repeal Obamacare for the 50th time. Slackers! 
Congress is not supposed to be a fucking assembly line churning out new laws. Measuring the productivity of the legislative system by how many bills it passes is shortsighted at best.
Whats wrong with this? Why should they be judged on bills passed? You guys really want MORE laws?
"Quite honestly, judging them on the number of new bills passed is stupid...... We have enough rules / laws / tax breaks / loopholes / pet projects / etc. And as much as this pains me, I would agree with Boehner to some extent. Part of their job SHOULD be to review existing legislation and get rid of stuff that doesnt apply anymore, etc, etc. Does that mean I feel that this Congress has done a good job? Fuck no. There have been many important issues that they have just dodged entirely and a ton of partisan bullshit...... "
"Man, that sounds like an awesome job. Tons of money, not much work, and no one to really be accountable to."
Do we need more bills passed? I mean really. 
What a bizarre way of grading Congress. 
"Be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it. Here in NC theyre steamrolling legislation through, and I know many here wish they werent being so productive"
Good.
This should come as no surprise. The Speaker of the House has already said we should not be judged on how many new laws we create. We ought to be judged on how many laws we repeal. So we should expect at least 937 more attempts at repealing the ACA before the end of 2014.
Dont entirely blame the House. The Senate has equal responsibility in this since both side must pass a bill to get it to the Presidents desk.
They really do believe in the Unitary Executive.
"Is is me or is that a poor way to judge Congress? Congress was intentionally designed so very little legislation did get passed, thats why it has to go through the two houses and then has a chance of getting vetoed. Look at the police state. We want to be tough on crime because people want to see their tax dollars at work, but handing out speeding tickets to meet quotas isnt helping anyone. It inflates the numbers to say crime is being dealt with and justifies expanding the police force, but actually causes injustices in society. I say quality over quantity. Id rather a meth maker go down instead of 100 pot heads. You can criticize Congress for the student loan rate hikes, for gutting financial regulation, for toying with the idea of SOPA/PIPA, for renewing the PATRIOT Act, for playing chicken with our debt ceiling, etc. People are disappointed with Congress for failing to represent them and fight for their interests instead of some lobby or corp, not over the amount of legislation."
"Nothing about this Congress is good. But passing a shit ton of bills doesnt make them good either. Why is it that were judging a Congress based on how many bills they have or have not passed, rather than judging them based on the ones they have? Or based on the success or failure of the bills theyve passed? This Congress has done a lot of terrible things, but passing too few bills isnt even measurable to the terrible ones that **have** been passed. Lets focus on those, then come back to this issue."
" Boehner says they should be judged by the laws they repealed instead of passed. Since they have repealed none, it is the worst congress ever. There is no standard you can brew that makes the Boner congress look good."
"This Congress is embarrassing indeed, however the title of this post is a bit off. The **Congress** has passed just 22 bills that have been sent to Obama, not just the House."
"Well now that the country has been turned over to Wall Street, what really is left for congress to do?"
"Typical Reddit. If the GOP Congress had passed hundreds of bills from their agenda, then Im sure Reddit would be dancing in the streets. "
"I need a listing of those 22 passed bills. My gut tells me 20 post office namings, repealing the ban on insider trading in Congress, and some kind of expanded powers for the NSA."
Too busy repealing ACA &amp; stirring up horseshit scandals to be productive......oh &amp; hes black. 
"Well, thats what happens when 16 per cent of eligible voters show up, as was the case in 2010. 18 goddamned Republican shitbags need to go. Only 18. The current bunch has as a strategic plan, the obstruction of bills, even popular and needed bills, so they can derail the black president from showing a productive term in office."
I can imagine somewhere on the freerepublic forums they are saying least productive president ever.
Because more than half of Congress won their votes by saying government doesnt work. The second they became part of government they tried very hard to make it not work. 
who says passing bills is a good thing? 
"Judging from the posts here, its basically the single-digit percentage of America who approves of a Congress thats getting nothing done (on purpose, I might add) that is in control of our country right now. Wow, thats scary."
"term limits please - these people are not working for us, they are working to keep their plush government jobs..."
"This is the single most important thing in America right now. Replace this congress and this Senate in 2014 or we are all doomed. There are enough smart, informed, loyal Americans left that we can elect the right politicians this time around. All but a handful of incumbents have to be replaced."
And why is this necessarily a bad thing?
I see nothing wrong with that...
"Oh of course they dont pass very many bills. Everythings working perfectly, why would they need to change anything!?"
"You elect Republicans, this is what you get. Nothing."
Do congressmen and women still work during recess? I would like a 5 week vacation.
The apple is rotten at the top!
Shouldnt since people began keeping track of these things date back to the first time a bill was passed? So 1787 or so. I would hope we have a record of all bills to be passed by either chamber.
7* months ftfy
"Makes you wonder huh, if they passed 23 bills how the fuck are we still spending 4 trillion a year."
"Good. The less they do, the better. "
"I think a lot of people will think no laws is a good thing- but there are many laws that need to be passed just to keep things functioning. Appropriations bills are laws that need to be passed, so are authorization bills, to keep the government functioning. Most people dont realize how much good things, things that keep our society/economy functioning. So while I agree in some respects gridlock isnt always a bad thing but there are different degree of gridlock and the gridlock we are in now isnt a good type."
it is a problem only if you assume every bill passed and signed is a good thing. or that we need every increasing numbers of laws
Maybe we shouldnt be so mad about them being unproductive since when they do produce something it regardless of party it usually sucks. 
"Its pathetic, and its fueled by a do nothing public. "
And why does this even matter? Obama has been using Executive Order to bypass congress so much so that he doesnt even need congress to do their job.

Our instant news and mass media turns every word into a talking point and every vote into political suicide. 
"Lets pass 1,000 bills that increase domestic spying and prison complexes! Productivity!!"
"This is not a bug, it is a feature. Less chance for them to fuck things up. When they actually repeal more laws than they pass, thatll be true progress toward freedom."
Good. The less shitty ideas they try and turn into laws the better!
"Considering the kind of bills they would pass, I dont have a big problem with this. Now if only they were more effective at oversight."
Not making more stupid rules and regulations is a bad thing? Sounds pretty great to me!
And when did passing new laws become a productive measure??
"At this point, does anyone really want these jerkoffs to pass any bills? Two bills that I can think off the top of my head that they managed to pass were SOPA and CISPA. Again, does anyone REALLY want these people passing bills? Because I sure as hell dont!"
Why are people complaining about this? Congressional inaction is FAR preferable to Congressional action.
"Im actually okay with a less productive federal government. The less they get done, the less they can mess things up more. "
"Since Obama has taken over passing laws via executive order, there simply is no need for congress to be productive anymore. Stop complaining! Heil Obama!"
Good.
Good. Every time they do something we the people suffer.
"Dont assume the passage of more laws is inherently a good thing. No mans life, liberty, or property are safe while he legislature is in session. Gideon J. Tucker"
"I am actually happy these idiots havent passed many laws. I dont think they should be passing laws until they fix the garbage laws they have put in place. Such as Patriot Act. DMCA. The patent office needs an overhaul. Etc. I am sure you can think of some of your own. See, I dont mind them not passing laws so long as they revise the current ones, and take a long hard look to see how those laws have affected peoples lives in a negative manner. "
"The more numerous the laws, the more corrupt the government - Tacitus"
"They dont care about getting anything done, they just care about keeping their Teabagger base foaming at the mouth and voting for them. ITT: libertarian idiots thinking this is a good thing."
Good now lets keep going until we start repealing bad laws
"So, theyve done the least to expand government than any other Congress on record? Hooray, I guess?"
Perhaps we should consider outsourcing their jobs while theyre on vacation.
"Good. Obama wouldnt sign anything worthwhile, and what he would sign we dont want."
That just means America is almost perfect!
What liberal decided that Congress is a law-making factory to be judged by volume? What if things were going just great? Should they just keep cranking out new laws? Why? And if things are going shitty (like now) why should they pass laws that have a chance of being signed by the guy whose policies just make things *more* shitty?
Good. The less bills the government can pass the better. Everything they touch turns into shit. 
"And yet, Obama will blame Republicans, youll all fall for it, and keep voting for the guy with the D by their name. Or, youll get mad, and vote for someone with an R by their name. How about you vote for someone whos voting record you actually looked up? someone who stood by what they said theyd do, instead of blaming others? Oh, and heres a nice site for you to look up the voting records of politicians. www.ontheissues.org"
"Did anyone ever stop to think that maybe its a GOOD thing that our legislators arent continuing to over legislate the living shit out of everything. Seriously... we dont need new laws every week. How about we repeal some stuff? get dumb laws off the books, reduce the cluttered and completely unenforceable littany of laws we already have - maybe update them, instead of passing new ones? I think people dont realize how little we actually need from congress. FFS how many (essentially) duplicate laws do we have?"
I love the caveat sent to President Obama implying an unproductive house when in reality it is Harry Reids senate that wont get anything done. This however is not a bad thing. That we have convinced ourselves that counting pages of laws and regulations coming from legislation as some sort of positive measure is very disturbing.
"YEAH!!!!! The congress that passes the fewest laws, commits the least violence. If the 22 bills they passed hadnt been bi-partisan examples of crony capitalism, and had instead been bills like the anti-spying bill, and the perhaps some bills to prevent drone strikes of children and American citizens, then perhaps they could do even less violence!!"
"Funny how people think more laws are a good thing, and that the measure of a good Congress is somehow directly related to the number of bills they pass. We have plenty of laws. Too many, in fact. The focus of Congress must be on whether they accomplish their basic duties in an effective manner. Based on the last several years, its clear they arent, especially in the Senate - [which couldnt pass a budget for more than three years...](http://www.politifact.com/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/28/bob-corker/bob-corker-says-senate-has-not-passed-budget-more-/)"
Is the unspoken message here that we just need to centralize decision making power to the president and be done with this so-called democracy?
Good. The less they do the less they fuck shit up
they still did too much
See knowing stuff like this only enrages me more when I see some right wing hack job blaming Obama. Yeah the dude has done some shady shit but this Congress is to blame for the majority of problems we have right now. 
Why do we always need more laws?
"To the folks posting that less laws are a good thing, that argument is really invalid. To repeal a bad law requires a Bill superseding the original law. There are other ways to do this as well of course but the fact remains, this congress is THE LEAST productive ever no matter how you slice it! "

"Why are you moron libs so insane? Do you moron libs understand that our glorious congresscritters do NOT work for you? They work for Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Pharma, AIPAC, the Military Industrial Complex, etc. The 1%. The plutocrats. So the *less* they do, the better. Idiot libs. Why are they so insane?"
Just shows you how bad leadership was from the President. You are complaining that Obama cant lead. I agree with you whole heartedly. 
"Good, the only thing worse than an unproductive Congress is a productive one. Lets see if we can get the amount of new legislation reduced to zero."
We dont need more laws. We need to review what we have and clean up the shit. I am in no way defending their bulla hit. Lets get rid of all the spying shit since 9/11
"Productive does NOT mean passed new laws. On balance Id rather they repealed a few, but Ill take only a handful of new ones."
"Least productive Congress, but I fully expect to hear the worthless GOP bitch and moan as Obama decides to try to get things done through Executive order instead and completely bypass Congress. "
"Or, perhaps, passing a plethora of unneeded bills in the past was unnecessary and counterproductive, and congress is finally acting like responsible puppets. "
"We do not really need more law, in fact, I would be happy if they spent a couple of sessions repealing stuff"
You can thank the do nothing Obstructionist Democrats in the senate for that
You make that sound like a bad thing...
"they shot down gun control and consistently obstruct the bullshit the dems keep trying to shovel on us. ya, they give wallstreet a free pass, but still less of a failure than if we had a dem congress. you folks even wanna think about what kinda shit fuck that would be?"

Ill take no action over the goddamn atrocities theyve been passing over the last 4 years.

"This whole havent passed any bills therefore theyre the worst ever argument is really lame to me. The problem isnt that theyre not passing bills. If they were refusing to pass the bills because they genuinely thought they were bad bills, then I might actually have some respect for them. The problem is that they arent refusing to pass bills because they think its the right thing to do - theyre doing it because it benefits them politically. "
This is not a bad thing... they spend everyday trying to add more laws and regulations. Have a 2 month session on the serious issues and leave us the fuck alone.
"I heard McConnell say that When the choices are to do things like reinstate the inheritance tax or not, you go with, not, and call it a win. Hard to disagree. "
Its hard to pass good law when there is a lousy leader in the WH. 
"The rumblings I?m seeing in the rumor mill are that the house will indeed hold the debt ceiling hostage and force a default. [This in turn, may force the president into a catch 22 of sorts where no matter what he does, it may be illegal under the constitution. ](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/if-congress-wont-raise-the-debt-ceiling-obama-will-be-forced-to-break-the-law/280176/) This could then lead to an impeachment. An impeachment starts in the house and they only need a simple majority to start a ruling in the senate. I imagine that it would end up going the way the Clinton impeachment hearings did, but it would not surprise me one bit if this was the road the house does indeed take. "
"I was so hoping this headline was pulled out of some leftist rag site with a one-sided pop-up poll that prevents you from reading the article. Nope. Time to start hoarding gold, bottled water, and gasoline.... *again*"
Anyone with a brain would know this. If you dont pay your debts people dont want to lend to you. Time to reelect all of Congress. 
"Republicans have a habit of knowingly turning lies into talking points. John Boehners statement that a vote wont pass the house is a recent example - strong evidence suggests he knows that it will pass but repeats the statement anyway rather than act. Whether they believe their own bullshit or not they are likely to press on. Severely damaging the US economy is wonderful for their goals: It clearly demonstrates that government is bad, and they preach for smaller government. If the American peoples memories fail to extend for more than 6 months, as they often do, then the best thing they can do to get more Republicans elected is to have a weak economy that they can blame on the current party. Even indirectly, it helps them get elected because the more people distrust government, the more they lean Republican. And finally, even if you dont believe they are specifically racist, a minority is still in the white house and they want history to remember minorities as failed leaders for the benefit of their own partys image. The outcomes for their narrative all look decent."
"back in 2006, Barack Obama also thought that breaching the debt limit was no big deal."
I wonder if all the people who bought gold to hedge against the coming collapse of society are hoping for this.
"Florida U.S. Representative Ted Yoho likes to point out that he is a large animal veterinarian as opposed to a small animal veterinarian. He treats horses and cattle, not cats and dogs. So be it. Im sure there is a significant difference and requires special training and education in each speciality. Yet he compares the U.S. national economy to his small business. Household and business economics is called microeconomics; national economics falls under the category of macroeconomics. Both are valid specialities within the field of economics, but you cannot apply business economics to national economies any more than you can use techniques used for kittens for treating a cow. Some of macroeconomics is counterintuitive and has absolutely no comparison to microeconomics. Just as I wouldnt rely on myself to medically treat an animal, Rep. Yoho should seek and rely on the advice of a trained and educated economist for economic advice."

"If we end up defaulting, I think we should physically take over the Capitol and the house and senate offices. Occupying a park is one thing, occupying the offices of the government will really get the message across. Who among us would join me?"
"There is a large movement in the Tea party, and in the Libertarian Right, to radically change the current economic system. The criticisms are valid in many ways, but there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what sudden change will bring. Many fail to comprehend what a debt ceiling breach will look like. They think that if you removed the Fed, or that if the US defaulted than all would shift in a positive way. The debt would be brought under control, the dollar would regain strength, and the economy would return to some picturesque past that never really existed. The reality would be very different, and could shake the foundation of our economic and political systems. This is why it will not be breached. There are too many vested interests in the current system to see it crashed so flippantly. I am all for the end of a private central bank, and the end of infinite growth economics. That being said, you cant expect to destroy a system without having a viable option to replace it. edit: forgot a word"
Not surprising that a man whose last name rhymes with YOLO thinks that not paying our bills and destroying the world economy is a great idea.

"None of that will probably happen though, even if the debt ceiling deadline is reached without a resolution. Moodys and S&amp;P have both stated they will only downgrade US credit if the treasury fails to make its next coupon payment - which is at the end of October. Now, the treasury has several options in the case of a debt ceiling crisis. Come end of October, they must pay roughly $6 B of coupon payments to sovereign debt holders, but they also must pay off roughly $50 B in other payments. The Treasury only has about $30 B, so here are their options: 1. Sales of assets. Treasury believes this would be very unfair for taxpayers. 2. Across the board Payment Cuts. Its almost impossible to make line item payment cuts (due to the millions of single payments the treasury makes a month), so an alternative solution is to make across the board payment cuts - basically, paying 96% of every bill that becomes due, leaving 4% to pay later. 3. Privatization of coupon payments. This wont happen for reasons I can elaborate on later. 4. Temporary delays across the board. If we reach Oct 18 and the Treasury has $50 B of bills to pay and they only have $30 B, then this plan prescribes them to delay any payments (except for coupon payments) until they have the $50 B necessary to make the full payment. Effectively, no matter what happens, the US Treasury department will pay the coupon payments, thus alleviating a technical US Default. There are many other things to be worried about that I could touch upon - like the high probability that banks would begin charging negative interest rates on deposits if they see a flight of safety of investors from money market funds and short-term securities, to banks.... "
"They dont care, they have millions safely stashed overseas. If anything itll just mean cheaper labor for their benefactors."

"The stock market is already contracting. What happens when people such as myself decide to dump their stocks because we lose confidence in Congress making a deal? Snowball? Thats an even bigger incentive for me to go ahead and dump my stock. What people dont seem to understand is that the 17th is a big deal but just simply coming within 48 hours of not reaching a deal will have serious repercussions. The market is already contracting, treasury rates are already going up, and hundreds of thousands of people are not being paid not putting that money back into the economy. We are legitimately facing another recession if this crap isnt resolved by Sunday at 11:59. "
The 1% doesnt give a fuck. The Romney types all have their money in Swiss francs.
"Im beginning to think this is all just the coda to their buy gold and guns plan. Gold and guns arent particularly valuable now, but they would be in a United States where the dollar has no value. If the people supporting these nuts realized that the plan was to make dollars worth nothing, maybe they wouldnt support them. Maybe."
Well republicans arent bright.
Would this hypothetical debt ceiling crisis affect the availability of student loans? Im going to be really sad if my education is arrested because of a disparity between the cost of tuition and the availability of aid. 
"Ah yes, so putting it all onto a bigger credit card is a much better solution. Especially when you can never pay back the debt because its attached to every dollar that you borrow of your US Currency which is actually private bank currency on loan. Yes, all of this makes much more sense than actually printing our own money, with real worth and no debt. Our children will curse us for this willful ignorance and fiscal irresponsibility."
"Did those people get any education at all when they believe that this is not a big deal ? Goddamn, get your shit together before it has a serious impact on the rest of the world . "
The national debt is the GOPs Reichstag fire.
Can anyone explain why interest rates would skyrocket instead of remain low? My understanding is that interest rates go up when the economy is doing well (to cool it off). They go down when the economy is doing poorly (to get people to spend more). Why is this different?
"For everyone here that says this is a great wall street bank conspiracy, you are wrong. I know this because I am day trader, and keeping a very close eye on the market, and the fear of the banks and big business is very real. Its also important to note that politically, I am a Marxist (and I say that in a loving and proud way) so I am more to the left then most of you, but that does not change what is going on in the market. We are not entitled to our own facts. To put it simply, the world has agreed to use the USD as global currency. This means everyone in the world is willing to take their payment in USD because it is seen as stable currency. If the confidence in USD falls apart, in the chaos that follows, at least in the short term, Japan banks could want to sell gold, but only accepting Yen. A European bank could want to buy gold, but to buy into Yen, to make the trade possible, would send the Yen skyrocketing making the gold more expensive. Essentially, the global currency situation breaks down into a global bartering system, where you hope you have what they are willing to accept. The extra transaction cost would freeze up the market. The market is freaking out, because there is no real way to hedge against a US default. It is completely off the playbook and no one knows how the market will react, or even if there will be a market to come back to. Even though as a small investor, I have am making good money on market fears, even I plan to get out of the way when the actual default deadline nears. Furthermore, large financial institutions cant move like small investors can. They need to worry about maintaining market stability when they sell. And to truely get away from default risk, they pretty much have to sell everything. The loss of liquidity that would be triggered by a default could mean that Goldman Sacks will actually have to hold on to the physical corn they bought futures for and cant sale. A sign of the confusion in the market can be seen through gold. Although the US dollar has been dropping, gold is dropping with it, which is counter to all normal market wisdom. In fact gold, at time of writing is around a 3 month low, even with the weak dollar. This is because no one knows what to do. tl:dr The market is really freaking out about default because it would mean we will have to refine what we mean by market. "
"I would like to think that all of this blustering is just a big bluff to force Obama to concede, except that these guys have shown over and over that they have come to believe their own propaganda. Wealthy Republican voters need to understand that their portfolios are about to take a massive hit. You may think Obamacare might destroy America, but this fight over it is certainly going to destroy your net worth."
"Wouldnt it be funny if Anonymous froze the bank accounts of Tea party Congressmen to show them first hand what defaulting can do? Hey Anon, you guys busy, havent heard anything from you guys lately."
"the debt ceiling is bullshit. the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution (which, like it or not, Congress and the President are bound by) states that The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. Simply by imposing a ceiling they are arguably violating the Constitution. Debt Ceilings and government shutdowns are exactly why this amendment was enacted - to stop these horrendous political shit shows that make us look bad. We need to breach this false debt ceiling to abolish it once and for all and restore the public debt to its constitutional footing. "

The mistake you make here is that you assume these same republicans view these as bad things. They are actively trying to tank the economy. What you just described are their explicit goals.
"If it wasnt a big deal the Republicans wouldnt have any leverage, so they wouldnt have done this in the first place. Can you say cognitive dissonance?"

"Mr. President, I rise today to talk about Americas debt problem. The fact that we are here today to debate raising Americas debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government cant pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Governments reckless fiscal policies. Over the past 5 years, our federal debt has increased by $3.5 trillion to $8.6 trillion. That is trillion with a T. That is money that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, borrowed from China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers. And over the next 5 years, between now and 2011, the Presidents budget will increase the debt by almost another $3.5 trillion. Numbers that large are sometimes hard to understand. Some people may wonder why they matter. Here is why: This year, the Federal Government will spend $220 billion on interest. That is more money to pay interest on our national debt than well spend on Medicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. That is more money to pay interest on our debt this year than we will spend on education, homeland security, transportation, and veterans benefits combined. It is more money in one year than we are likely to spend to rebuild the devastated gulf coast in a way that honors the best of America. And the cost of our debt is one of the fastest growing expenses in the Federal budget. This rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, robbing our cities and States of critical investments in infrastructure like bridges, ports, and levees; robbing our families and our children of critical investments in education and health care reform; robbing our seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on. Every dollar we pay in interest is a dollar that is not going to investment in Americas priorities. Instead, interest payments are a significant tax on all Americans ? a debt tax that Washington doesnt want to talk about. If Washington were serious about honest tax relief in this country, we would see an effort to reduce our national debt by returning to responsible fiscal policies. But we are not doing that. Despite repeated efforts by Senators Conrad and Feingold, the Senate continues to reject a return to the commonsense Pay-go rules that used to apply. Previously, Pay-go rules applied both to increases in mandatory spending and to tax cuts. The Senate had to abide by the commonsense budgeting principle of balancing expenses and revenues. Unfortunately, the principle was abandoned, and now the demands of budget discipline apply only to spending. As a result, tax breaks have not been paid for by reductions in Federal spending, and thus the only way to pay for them has been to increase our deficit to historically high levels and borrow more and more money. Now we have to pay for those tax breaks plus the cost of borrowing for them. Instead of reducing the deficit, as some people claimed, the fiscal policies of this administration and its allies in Congress will add more than $600 million in debt for each of the next 5 years. That is why I will once again cosponsor the Pay-go amendment and continue to hope that my colleagues will return to a smart rule that has worked in the past and can work again. Our debt also matters internationally. My friend, the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, likes to remind us that it took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up only $1 trillion of foreign-held debt. This administration did more than that in just 5 years. Now, there is nothing wrong with borrowing from foreign countries. But we must remember that the more we depend on foreign nations to lend us money, the more our economic security is tied to the whims of foreign leaders whose interests might not be aligned with ours. Increasing Americas debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that the buck stops here. Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase Americas debt limit. - Senator Barack Obama, 2006"
Telling the people that want to burn the government down to stop before the do is completely pointless. 
"From the Congressional Record on March 16, 2006: Increasing Americas debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means the buck stops here.

I therefore intent to oppose the effort to increase Americas debt ceiling. --Barack Obama"

"This is fearmongering bullshit. As an annual federal expense, the interest on the debt is a daunting figure (its over 400 billion) but the US takes in ~$3tn through taxes and fees every year. In order to default on the debt, the US would have to stop paying that interest. Not going to happen. Seriously, this is a Fox News-level partisan circlejerk. While its true that we could be in serious trouble if the interest rate goes up, some of us have been saying that for years and have been ignored by conservatives *and liberals* alike. To me, it sure seems like this is more political lever than legitimate concern. "
"It is no big deal, to them. They can care less about what happens. Its all about them. They wont be ruined if anything happens. They have shit tons of money. They care less about getting reelected at this point."

"in reality it isnt a big deal unless the president breaks the law, which I suppose is a distinct possibility. The federal government takes in more than enough money per day to pay its bills and this includes interest on debt. By law the president must pay the bills first. There is no risk of default. So in reality, not raising the debt ceiling is not the crisis the liberals are trying to make it. One would hope they do not just raise the debt ceiling and instead recognize the massive problem we have with spending and end it. The more debt we have, the more beholden we are to the one holding the loan."
"This is probably a bit conspiracy theory, but if 2008 happens all over again those guys are going to get rich from it. When stock prices plummet due to some catastrophe, the stocks basically go on sale. 3M for $50? Ill take a shitload of that and then when things get back to normal in a year, itll have jumped to $150 and Ill be smiling. Most people in the stock market are bad investors and buy things when they are high and sell as soon as they start to fall in price. A lot of the smart investors out there make a killing because of recessions by properly valuating companies. Not only that, with a lack of credit and investors pulling money from the market a lot of companies that were struggling a little or were getting ready to make a move to grow their business suddenly find themselves in a much worse place. Creating less competition for the corporations that invested money into the candidates they support, which in turn gives them more market share and more money. After the newest supreme court decision goes inevitably anti campaign finance reform, then those congressmen not only pocket the money from the gains they made in the stock market when it recovers, but they also get larger donations to their campaign to help them stay in office. What corporation wouldnt want a worker so loyal to them that they would destroy the US in order to make that company more money? Maybe well find out. Ive lived in Oregon too long..."

Failing to raise the debt ceiling will not cause us to default unless Obama chooses to default, which would be an unconstitutional action. Its on him. Dont tell me the government has no waste to cut. Furthermore, the concept of having a law that sets a limit on something and then raising that limit every chance possible is ludicrous. Get rid of the debt ceiling, or abide by it. And again, not raising the debt ceiling does not mean we automatically default on our debts. But whatever. Dont bother replying, I wont read it."
How the hell is the American dollar on-par with Canadas with their debt so extravagantly high? 
Which is all worthwhile if it will help reign in reckless spending by Democrats.
We should have been cutting costs in governments trying to get to a balanced budget for years... but neither party wants to spend less and have less power
"How is anyone supposed to take this seriously? Could, could, could, could, could you believe the title? If I eat my lunch too fast, the global economy could collapse. This statement is as true as that title. Holy fuck."
"Its not a good thing when the livelihood of an entire economy is based on ever increasing debt. Thats usually referred to as a ponzi scheme. Propping it up with more debt isnt necessarily smart or compassionate, either. It creates a weaker economy in the long run and dumps on all the burden onto future generations. PS The Republicans are still morons. "
"even though im not a tea partier or republican, the idea of a default and the consequences predicted seems like it would have a long term benefit since near zero interest rates are what is holding us in permanent recession. if interest rates go up, we can compete with the federal government in loaning money to banks i.e. theyll start giving us interest on our savings and checking accounts. and if it causes the value of our money to decline compared to other currencies then that will make our exports cheaper and imports more expensive, driving up both foreign and domestic demand for what we offer."
The only thing that will happen is Obama will just have to endure calls 1am from some cockroach of a collection agency in China threatening him if they dont pay right away.
Who got rich during the last financial crisis anyway? The money has to flow somewhere.
What? Repubs and libertarian idiots dont know how economics and civics work? What. A. Surprise. 
Then the Dems need to come to the table and talk about fixing the ACA...
"Obama said this in 2006- ?The fact that we are here today to debate raising America?s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can?t pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government?s reckless fiscal policies. Over the past 5 years, our federal debt has increased by $3.5 trillion to $8.6 trillion. That is ??trillion?? with a ??T.?? That is money that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, borrowed from China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers. And over the next 5 years, between now and 2011, the President?s budget will increase the debt by almost another $3.5 trillion. Increasing America?s debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that ??the buck stops here.?? Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America?s debt limit.? "

"even though im not a tea partier or republican, the idea of a default and the consequences predicted seems like it would have a long term benefit since near zero interest rates are what is holding us in permanent recession. if interest rates go up, we can compete with the federal government in loaning money to banks i.e. theyll start giving us interest on our savings and checking accounts, something that has been conspicuously absent since the economy was genuinely good. higher interest rates will mean more spending by boomer retirees. and sooner retirement which reduces labor supply and employment of newer workers go up. and if it causes the value of our money to decline compared to other currencies then that will make our exports cheaper and imports more expensive, driving up both foreign and domestic demand for what we offer. im not saying it would be painless, certainly raising interest rates without a default would be better but that just aint going to happen."

"But a plummeting dollar is absolutely great for a specific set of the establishment. Specifically people who own stuff, and those predominantly exporting (from the US).

"I think we all know that this shutdown is a bit of a political show. In fact the government is still paying themselves, i.e. still working, which means this will get resolved...but not without some pain for the people who are hugely impacted and actually not working. Of course, collateral damage is justified in war and isnt our political process a perfect parallel? On another note, the housing market has become very accustomed to extremely low interest rates which arent helping the economy bounce back. And just recently the markets fully expected Bernanke to raise the interest rates, but he didnt. Now that Yellen will be the new Fed Chair, it would make sense to manufacture disruption in the government while jacking up the interest rates in the process. If raising the rates is seen as a byproduct of government shutdown then there really isnt any one to blame for it. Sure the GOP will get some heat, but in politics, it wont be remembered. "

Maybe Im just way outta the loop on this one but I thought Republicans were against raising the debt ceiling?^bracing^for^the^downvotes.
Correction: Many *Democrats* think breaching the debt ceiling is no big deal.
"If the value of the dollar plummets, wouldnt that increase the price of US traded stocks (being priced in dollars)? Not saying this is good in any way, just trying to understand the effect."
The fed would hold interest rates down. There would be virtually no change in interest rates.
"In other words, the same thing that will happen eventually if we *keep raising* the debt cieling over and over again."
"Hitting the debt ceiling wouldnt be a good thing, and repeat offender hostage taker Republicans shouldnt be rewarded, but seriously people, get a grip. Lets unpack these claims. * Credit markets could freeze. Yes, and a comet could hit D.C. (we should be so lucky) Lots of things *could* happen but are unlikely. Anyone care to present a plausible argument for why they probably *will* freeze? * The value of the dollar could plummet. Again, we should be so lucky. The dollar has fallen somewhat against, say, the Chinese yuan, but theres still room to go. A cheaper dollar would reduce our trade deficit and boost the economy. Whenever someone says something like, We need the Chinese to stop manipulating their currency, what do you think they mean? They *mean* for the dollar to fall. * U.S. interest rates could skyrocket. Again, could. But will they? Short-term rates are nearly 0% right now. [Here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/08/whats-happening-in-the-treasury-bill-market-today-should-terrify-you/?tid=pm_business_pop) is another scary Post article just in time for Halloween. Gaze upon the scary graph with its skyrocketing interest rates and be terrified...until you notice the scale of the graph. Skyrocketing from ~0% all the way to...0.29% *Yawn*. * There might be a financial crisis... Then again, there might not be. * ...and [a] recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse Enough with the weasel word could. Please, the recession and downturn after 2008 wasnt caused by the financial crisis. It was caused by the collapse of the housing bubble, *which has already collapsed.* Terrible reporting, but then The Post isnt much of a serious newspaper."
"Serious question time: Is breaching the debt ceiling a big deal for *most people*? If the media are to be trusted, and thats a very VERY shaky if, it would seem that most people in the US have shit credit, shit jobs, etc, etc. If the dollar plummets, that reduces the purchasing power of people that dont really have much purchasing power in the first place, due to shitty credit and low wages. Is that such a big deal? If the economy goes to shit, people will still be working low-wage jobs and barely be able to scrape by. Doesnt sound much different than the present situation. Are the people that are going to take the biggest hit at the top of the pyramid? Is that really a problem? "
"I know it makes me evil, but Im actually kinda hoping the US dollar reeks a plunge. As a non-american it will make buying things online much cheaper for me."
Didnt Obama vote no during 2006 for raising the debt ceiling? 
So what should I do l now with my crappy 401k so I dont get screwed later?
"Maybe higher interest rates would make them think twice about recklessly borrowing money. Also, the dollar has been devaluing for a long time lol"
Im expecting the worst to happen here in the US.
"Im with the republicans on this one: the debt has to be defaulted on and, if at all possible, the worst choice has to be made for how to handle the ensuing fiasco. This would have a lot of beneficiary effects: - the US will be dropped as the world reserve currency by all the countries who decide theyve just about put up with enough American bullshit for the next 5,000 years - US military adventures would become at once too expensive to be continued - reduced economic activity would drastically reduce pollution output"
It does have a negative impact *but* we wont default...Thats way overexaggerated 
"the federal reserve, the private bank that has no reserve, has no money to loan, yet, when they print this money from nowhere and then charge interest, the profit you pay this bank in the form of income tax is real money....so basically they tell you your fucked if you dont borrow more money from them, yet on the other hand your fucked if you do cause no ones buying your bonds, except of course the fed....haha, never give a sucker an even break"
"Day after day the Republicans continue an course of action that can be clinically defined, Schizophrenia is a group of severe brain disorders in which people interpret reality abnormally. The Grand Old Party has schizophrenia as defined medically. Now where do you find a hospital to admit that many people, health insurance to pay the costs of the their cure and maintenance? The House Majority, the Republican leadership are mentally ill--and we are paying the price."
"So if this is the case, why doesnt the fed.gov spend less money? The power of the money allocation is in the hands of the house. I dont see why the house doesnt right up and pass a budget that defunds obamacare and other stuff they dont like and just not up the debt. If they up the debt, they just prolong and make worse the eventual crash."
"could, could, could, might. Noone knows"
A real disturbance in the force. 
"Yeah lets just to keep the Game up instead. Something has to give, and the Dollar has to go. "
A crash of this fiat dollar is looming. The dollar has already lost 95% of its value thanks to a democrat in the white house.
key word: _could_ 
maybe those survival seeds arent such a bad idea after all
This is what all of those cash for gold shops have been waiting for...
To be fair all those things can still happen after we raise it aswell. We have changed very little from 2008.
*many republicans and democrats
The problem with a statement like this is you can easily (and justifiably) substitute probably wont for every place this statement says could and the meaning is reversed and yet is no less true. Dont tell me what could happen. Tell me what will happen.
If your politicians were smart they would be in front of every camera in the country talking about a Republican Recession at every turn. 
So much use of the subjunctive in the thread title. Could the debt ceiling also fall and crush my house and family? Im really scared now.
"Im still in the pits of the 2008 recession. Would somebody hire me on as a full time employee for god sake? Instead of a being contract worker, or instead of hiring a foreign worker to come work in the United States on a green are and take the job away from me (all the while paying him less than an appropriate wage for the job). Im looking at you Microsoft."
"The sky is falling, the sky is falling!"
"At least we wont be sending billions in aid to other countries, let it fail."
I really think china is behind this in some way. Theyre trying to destabilize the dollar to the point that a different currency will become the global standard.
"At some point we have to make real spending cuts, I guess its not today."
"While the Libertarians are going, the alternative to keeping the status quo is worse."
"Wasnt the the last credit rating drop due to our debt, not the fact that we stumbled to increase the debt limit? that being said, if all we do is increase the limit every time to we get to it, why the hell do we even have it?"
So be it. Bring it down.
"If you are crazy enough that your name show up in this list, its time for you to face a recall election."
"If we have to borrow MORE money to afford the interest on money that weve already borrowed, not only is it a Ponzi Scheme, the US is already bankrupt. The best thing for the country WOULD be bankruptcy. Debts voided, a fresh start. Continually taking on more and more debt to pay the interest on what we already owe is not ideal."
"Republicans fucking up your pensions for the past two generations. Whats not to love about them? Id MUCH rather pay a little more in taxes with Democrats but at least your investments are making decent money. Im not kidding, thats the sad reality of the fiscal conservatives. Its like someone telling your daughter they have to perform an exorcism on her vagina with their penis to save her."
"There is a conceivable mechanism by which a shutdown might not have an adverse effect on the credit rating for a while. Were the Federal Government to prioritize debt repayment in lieu of transfer payments and the like would demonstrate that, more than anything, the U.S. will make sure to repay its debt. However, this probably wont be the case because it would mean millions of people who rely on things like social security would be left high and dry - and these people vote in large numbers. Any way you slice it, not raising the debt ceiling would be calamitous."
Not if you have insider information and hedge yourself against it. You can even make tons of profit. So I doubt the republicans care.
"When you have been preaching for some 3 decades that the gobment is evil, cutting its funding is considered almost a *goal* by some of these people. This is a legacy of NeoCon politics where the government is the enemy and defunding it is supposedly a good thing. "
That is precisely what they want to happen.
"Part of me really wants to see this happen. The US defaulting on its obligations I mean. Not because it could lead to a massive economic collapse, not because it could mean the end of the US Dollar as a world currency, not because it would make a few rich assholes betting on it richer than God. But because I think the political aftermath would be hilariously entertaining. Republicans (tea-baggers and regular) all saying *no-one told us this would happen*, its not our fault*, *this is your fault for not allowing us to ruin Obamacare* etc. And politicians wouldnt be the only entraining part of it - itd be fun to see what all the journalists would have to say. Im going to bet 10 dollars (10 dollar value **after** the crash) that all of them are going to wash their hands of it - a mix of *told ya* and *its not our fault for giving these fuckwads enough airtime to make them believe their own bullshit*."
The grapes of wrath are an angry bunch.
Yea thats never going to happen by something we do ourselves. Efficient market people.
I wonder how many of them are investing in foreign currency right about now.
"Dr. Zoidberg: Once again, the conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor. As someone who owes more than their net worth, yes this could slightly make sense. Yet we are talking about well to / rich politicians... Is it possible theyve been hoarding gold/oil somewhere?"
" Am I alone thinking its all a melodramatic scam? They know its all funny money anyway, its embarrassing they are so casual about that fact. The government is admitting they are traitors, terrorists actually by expecting us to be entertained by their own stupidity and lies. I do fear they are simply pushing to implement martial law and these are tests to see when were apathetic enough."
Not raising the debt ceiling does not imply a default. Theres so much waste in government that we could easily scrape together enough cash to cover debt interest.
Nobody is talking about defaulting. The GOP is talking about not raising the debt ceiling. That means no more borrowing. It doesnt mean default.
Its Obamacare all the time because they do not have any valid solutions for healthcare. 
laser like focus on jobs
"So lets see... The percentage of people covered through their work has been trending down and now coverage has become available and the GOP idea is: If we take coverage away for like 10s of millions of people, then theyll vote for us. Pure Genius!"
"The circle jerk, my god the circle jerk. "
"The Republicans are expected to gain seats in the Senate, could they achieve an majority? Its my understanding that mid-term elections favor the Rublicans; I guess because anti-Obama voters are motivated and Democratic voters are less motivated."
This should make for some super crazy campaign promises and double talk from the right. 
Seems to be the official line of the Democrats also. I listen to NPR everyday on my way to work and Ive noticed that not a single day goes by without a mention of Obamacare. I would rather the focus be on never forgetting that the government is spying on us and has no plan on stopping but I guess thats not as important. 
Not even pretending to care what the people want anymore. Just tell em this is good for America and remind em what happens if they vote for anyone else. Notice how theyve reeled back even the social-conservative bait they used to be able to rely on...this is literally all they have left.

So keep it up, GOP, all the way to 2014 and 2016--I double-dog dare you. Keep trying to make BENGHAZI!!!! a scandal as well, see how that works out for ya."
"Its the only hot button left to them that doesnt lose them more voting public. Of course this too will lose its meaning over time, and they may just revert to OBAMA, OBAMA, and OBAMA when that happens."
Too late assholes. How about dealing with some of our other looming problems?
"&gt;This time he?s seeking to raise doubts about the privacy protections on HealthCare.gov. ?American families have enough to worry about as we enter the new year without having to wonder if they can trust the government to inform them when their personal information ? entered into a government mandated website ? has been compromised,? Is there some the onion conspiracy going on that I am not privy too?"
"What, no Benghazi?"
So theyve basically officially stated their goals are to do nothing but undo the work of others. Sounds about right. GOBMENT!
"I am so sick of this debate! I consider myself pretty politically savvy, and I love to gobble up political news. But I am just so fatigued over this issue.

"The GOP is long since dead. Theyre hoping to improve their image by branding themselves as The Zombie Party, because zombies have great marketing numbers with the youth demographic."

"Someone needs to remind the GOP of the definition of insanity.... actually, if youre insane, you wont get it. "
In their defense they are just trying to save Americans from affordable healthcare. 
Good. They obviously havent learned anything. Rather them keep falling flat on obamacare than shift focus to other austerity measures that they can actually affect change on.

I just have to laugh at that lying sack of shit accusing others of misinformation. What a fucking joke!
"You guys are handling it all wrong. Whenever MY crazy relatives/friends whip out the Obama is a Socialist Muslim argument, I just say I know. Thats why the rest of us voted for him. How does it feel to have your ass kicked by a Socialist Muslim? ...that shuts them up *every* time."
The pro-Obamacare position is also based on misinformation. It goes both ways.
"Easier said then done. My facebook feed has been full of this picture- - http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/photos/ovaloffice.asp It shows Obama in front of a muslim prayer curtain and other Presidents in front of an American flag. The comments usually validate that Obama is indeed a muslim and this is proof of how stupid liberals are. When I counter that those curtains are, in fact, from the east room of the white house and have been there for 50+ years, and add that there is actually no such thing as a muslim prayer curtain, I get called a sheep, and told to stop drinking the kool-aid. As an added bonus, the Military folks chime in that Ive never served my Country so i dont know what Im talking about, etc. Its not a fun game and Im not going to play it anymore, you are on your own Obama. "
so it seems Obamas claim is that contrary reports are working (as in advertising) but his media and political barrage isnt (why?)
"Yknow - I do my best but instead of making pleas Obama could take the bull by the horns and purge the CPB (which runs PBS and NPR) of all the Bush Jr. lackies that Bush himself had installed after he took office. As it stands now, NPR at least (to be honest I dont listen to PBS news anymore) has been on a subtle anti-Obama campaign since he first ran for President. You can be sure in their balanced coverage they find ways to find all the spokespeople they can to blast the ACA."
"When people who are liars, call other people liars, are they lying?"
It will be called BushCare soon....
"Someday were going to see a massive lawsuit from people who didnt get health insurance because of the lies, and now face ruinous bills or are dying."

"##Quick Summary: - President Obama on Tuesday called for his supporters to correct their Republican friends when they spout incorrect facts they heard from conservative news outlets. - Obama also suggested opposition to his signature health-care law is based on such misinformation and is causing people who would benefit to not sign up. - Obama added: So if you?re able to reach out to them, and you just say, take a look, here, here, let?s get on the Web site. - Come on, Uncle Joe, I know you dont have health insurance. - You may not like the president, but this really is a good deal. *Disclaimer:^(these summaries are not guaranteed to be accurate, correct or even news.)* "
"That?s a nice sentiment and all, and it?s not like I don?t try, but most of the older men I know in my life cling to Fox News? brand of horseshit because whatever the fuck we taught kids at school in the 50s and 60s about communism stuck hard. They may waffle a bit on a few social or labor issues especially in private since theyve seen how bad things are for everyone who works for a living but racism and caring = sharing = USSR is ingrained in them to the point that you cant even really try and approach it without them going raving mad. "
If you like your healthcare you can keep it. 
"Easy fix president Obama, issue an executive order reinstating the Fairness Doctrine and Fox News would crumble. "
Holy shit this guy is getting desperate!
"Not all opposition, but certainly a lot of it. But when we say misinformation in this context, were talking about some *spectacular* lies. Its hard to convince your average Hannity fan of how wrong they are, because no one likes hearing everything you know is wrong."
"To be fair, misinformation from ANY source--right, left, or lame like CNN--should be called out and corrected. I want policy arguments to be based on facts. Thats the only way to get rational and honest debate. If the side I support spouts BS then we may make bad or unfair policy choices, which is not right even if it is what I originally supported."
"The opposition to the Affordable Care Act has claimed: 1) that Obamacare would increase health care and health insurance prices *Yesterday, the Obama Administration?s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a six-page report predicting that Obamacare could cause premiums to increase for nearly two-thirds of small- to medium-sized businesses.* http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/02/25/the-next-shoe-to-drop-obamacare-will-increase-the-cost-of-employer-sponsored-insurance/ 2) that Obamacare would decrease employment http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45010-breakout-AppendixC.pdf 3) that not enough people, particularly young people would sign up through the exchanges http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/02/20/biden-acknowledges-obamacare-enrollments-might-fall-significantly-short-of-target/ So, while some of the opposition has been over-the-top - the core claims have merit. Dismissing all opposition to Obamacare as illegitimate is absurd. Its easier to simply think that everyone who disagrees with you is dumb and lying - but its usually not the case. "
I will obey Obama! 
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/25/obama-urges-supporters-to-correct-misinformation-from-conservative-news/?tid=rssfeed Obama urges supporters to correct misinformation from conservative news ...

Obama urges supporters to get called Paid Shills on Reddit.
"I actually have been on the warpath on facebook. Ive been bringing it hard to my friends who have gotten swept up in this neocon brain washing HARD, and I think Ive started to open their eyes. I never argue as a liberal. I argue as a conservative whos sick of being misled by other conservatives. If its an actual issue, I show people what the rational conservative view should be. Case in point: climate change. I am constantly using actual science to refute pure nonsense, and when I get called a big government liberal, I remind conservatives that the free market capitalist position is that government should not be spending billions of dollars subsidizing fossil fuels, and the fact that they are getting harder to find proves our CO2 output will end up coming down as the price of fossil fuels goes up and demand for alternatives grow in the market. Its as if nobody ever even thought of it, yet they are proponents of free market capitalism (while voting for republicans who give out more welfare to corporations than anyone else.) I agree with some of the sentiment that you really cannot win with them, but you shouldnt stop trying. You should always bring facts, no matter what position youre arguing from. The one line I always get people with is If you have to lie in order to get others to think like you, then its not a point of view worth having. "
"Misinformation like when he said you keep your current plan if you liked it, even thought he knew what he was saying was a lie, and lots of people took him at his word and supported the ACA because of it? That kind of misinformation? How about the kind of misinformation where a previously set goal for the ACA was not met, so all of the sudden they have a new goal and act like the previous goal never existed? That kind of misinformation? "

"Well, population doesnt correlate to how much you are taking out either. But it looks like Texas was still paying in more than it was recieving, at least as of 2005. http://taxfoundation.org/article/federal-taxes-paid-vs-federal-spending-received-state-1981-2005 Though with that trending the way it is, they might be paying less now."

"You see, Elizabeth Warren is just *too smart* for these people. I truly believe that she makes too much sense for Congress to actually understand what shes saying. In contrast, we have this guy, who thinks Guam is going to tip over if we put too many Marines there: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cesSRfXqS1Q (Hes a democrat, by the way... facepalm.)"
"I dont get it... Are you saying I was wrong to contrast Warren with this idiot? Either he was completely idiotic, or he was making a completely childish attempt at humor in a serious and consequential hearing. Which is worse?"
"I dont agree with all of his opinions but the fact checks remain valid. And rise in murders due to enacting SYG laws is assuming that was the cause. There is no evidence that stand your ground was the cause. Criminologists are suspicious of sharp increases or decreases within a short time frame, he said. I don?t believe anything triples.?Increases that sharp are probably due to some artificial cause like a shift in how people are defining events, Kleck said. It?s possible nothing actually changed in frequency except police departments increasingly defined homicide claimed to be defensive as a justifiable homicide. ? Local police departments are increasingly viewing alleged defensible homicide as falling into the UCR definition. I don?t think they are trying to rig data, they honestly shifted their perceptions of what qualifies. Bill Eddins, state attorney in Florida?s 1st Circuit and president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, said he couldn?t conclude if there is a correlation between the stand your ground law and the increase in justifiable homicides. Although our overall crime rate has trended downward, the random violence seems to be increasing to me, Eddins said. To determine the effect of the stand your ground law would require examining how many times the statute was used, the result of the case and whether or not the stand your ground statute contributed to that resolution, he said. There is no real measurement set up to do that at this point. I cannot reach the conclusion that there is a direct correlation in the increases of justifiable homicide as a result of stand your ground law. I know other people are saying you can, but I can?t reach it. http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/mar/26/christopher-l-smith/sen-chris-smith-claimed-deaths-due-self-defense-fl/"
"His argument at the end that the rise in murders due to enacting SYG laws is worth it to preserve macho culture seems pathetic and ridiculous to me. Is macho culture really a good thing and even if it is, are you willing to die to protect it? Im sure as hell not."
"From an [actual multi-state study](http://econweb.tamu.edu/mhoekstra/castle_doctrine.pdf) of SYG laws: &gt;Results indicate the laws do not deter burglary, robbery, or aggravated assault. In contrast, they lead to a statistically significant 8 percent net increase in the number of reported murders and non-negligent manslaughters But we can be macho so its a win, right?"
"No, they didnt. the text of the legislation itself says [this](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr2346/text): None of the funds made available in this or any prior Act may be used to transfer or release an individual detained at Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as of the date of enactment of this Act, to the country of such individuals nationality or last habitual residence or to any other country other than the United States, unless the President submits to the Congress, in classified form 15 days prior to such transfer, the following information... So, yes, he could have brought them into the U.S. He could also have transfered them by providing the following information: - The name of any individual to be transferred or released and the country to which such individual is to be transferred or released. - An assessment of any risk to the national security of the United States or its citizens, including members of the Armed Services of the United States, that is posed by such transfer or release and the actions taken to mitigate such risk. - The terms of any agreement with another country for acceptance of such individual, including the amount of any financial assistance related to such agreement. Whats more, not only did he not even bother trying to veto the elgislation, he didnt even protest with his [signing statement](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-upon-signing-hr-2346) for the bill."
"The whole section: &gt;Sec. 14103. &gt;(a)None of the funds made available in this or any prior Act may be used to release an individual who is detained as of the date of enactment of this Act, at Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, or the District of Columbia. &gt;(b)None of the funds made available in this or any prior Act may be used to transfer an individual who is detained as of the date of enactment of this Act, at Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for the purpose of detention in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, or the District of Columbia, except as provided in subsection (c). &gt;(c)None of the funds made available in this or any prior Act may be used to transfer an individual who is detained, as of the date of enactment of this Act, at Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, or the District of Columbia, for the purposes of prosecuting such individual, or detaining such individual during legal proceedings, until 45 days after the plan detailed in subsection (d) is received. &gt;(d)The President shall submit to the Congress, in classified form, a plan regarding the proposed disposition of any individual covered by subsection (c) who is detained as of the date of enactment of this Act. Such plan shall include, at a minimum, each of the following for each such individual: &gt;(1)The findings of an analysis regarding any risk to the national security of the United States that is posed by the transfer of the individual. (2)The costs associated with transferring the individual in question. (3)The legal rationale and associated court demands for transfer. (4)A plan for mitigation of any risk described in paragraph (1). (5)A copy of a notification to the Governor of the State to which the individual will be transferred or to the Mayor of the District of Columbia if the individual will be transferred to the District of Columbia with a certification by the Attorney General of the United States in classified form at least 14 days prior to such transfer (together with supporting documentation and justification) that the individual poses little or no security risk to the United States. &gt;(e)None of the funds made available in this or any prior Act may be used to transfer or release an individual detained at Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as of the date of enactment of this Act, to the country of such individuals nationality or last habitual residence or to any other country other than the United States, unless the President submits to the Congress, in classified form 15 days prior to such transfer, the following information: &gt;(1)The name of any individual to be transferred or released and the country to which such individual is to be transferred or released. (2)An assessment of any risk to the national security of the United States or its citizens, including members of the Armed Services of the United States, that is posed by such transfer or release and the actions taken to mitigate such risk. (3)The terms of any agreement with another country for acceptance of such individual, including the amount of any financial assistance related to such agreement. &gt;(f)Prior to the termination of detention operations at Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the President shall submit to the Congress a report in classified form describing the disposition or legal status of each individual detained at the facility as of the date of enactment of this Act. Note that the first three subsections only allow the transfer to US soil for prosecution, and even then, there are conditions. The biggest problem in this early version of the NDAA was that it only allowed a prisoner to be released to his own country, very few of whom want the guys back. Congress later added language pertaining to the transfer prisoners to alternate countries, but added a condition that the receiving country would have to insure that they wouldnt be harmed. Recently, some of the restrictions have been lessened with Yemen, where most of the detainees are from, allowing for some transfers to occur, the first in a year, and the president has created a DoD position to oversee transfers. If he were to just order the place closed and move the prisoners there to say, Fort Leavenworth, he would have to explain where he got the funds to do so and when he said, I dunno, he could be charged with misappropriation of funds. He hasnt vetoed the bills because they are in the NDAA, the entire military budget for the year. He threatens every year, but congress knows hes not going to defund the military, from fueling tanks to caring for vets, over Guantanamo detainees. And even if he did, the bill passes with huge margins every year and the veto would be over ruled instantly. Heres a half-decent rundown of how hes tried and failed to close the facility. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/177/close-the-guantanamo-bay-detention-center/ "
"The appropriate thing would have been to let everyone there go, which he could have done provided: - The name of any individual to be transferred or released and the country to which such individual is to be transferred or released. - An assessment of any risk to the national security of the United States or its citizens, including members of the Armed Services of the United States, that is posed by such transfer or release and the actions taken to mitigate such risk. - The terms of any agreement with another country for acceptance of such individual, including the amount of any financial assistance related to such agreement."
"Well I know I always go to the Department of Health and Human Services to get my news. How about this one? &gt;The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed today charging that the Affordable Care Act will prevent people from keeping their current health plan and limit their choices. However, this ignores the realities of health reform....A key point to remember is that while the Act makes many changes to the individual market, it specifically allows those who want to keep their current insurance to do so. [Whitehouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/05/18/yes-you-can-keep-your-health-plan) &gt;Obama apparently never said you could keep your plan though. Barack Obama says that what hed said was you could keep your plan if it hasn?t changed since the law passed [Pants on Fire](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-what-hed-said-was-you-could-keep/) &gt;If you like your plan you can keep it and you don?t have to change a thing due to the health care law. [Whitehouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov/healthreform/healthcare-overview) I just dont understand why people insist on this not being a lie. "
The press release was issued to guess who? THE PRESS. You dont think they saw it? Its a pretty big deal you know. Not one reporter asked the President about the press release. Isnt that strange? Its because it was understood that people with sub par plans would lose their insurance if their were any changes made. Why didnt insurance companies notify people in 2010 who were buying new subpar plans that they would lose them in 2013? 
"This was issued to the press in 2010. &gt;The 17 million people who are covered in the individual health insurance market, where switching of plans and substantial changes in coverage are common, will receive the new protections of the Affordable Care Act sooner rather than later. Roughly 40 percent to two-thirds of people in individual market policies normally change plans within a year. In the short run, individuals whose plan changes and is no longer grandfathered will gain access to free preventive services, protections against restricted annual limits, and patient protections such as improved access to emergency rooms. http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/06/20100614e.html I think everyone knew back then what the President meant by you can keep your plan. It meant we arent the facist regime the GOP says we are. We arent going to take your plan away from you 98% of the people who have a good one. "

Luckily for you, the ignorant run this place and downvote anyone who says anything counter to their warped viewpoint.

Just like how Republicans scream about how individuals have their insurance plans cancelled, while ignoring the fact that such cancellations were routine *before* the ACA. "
"Politifact says it was Obamas idea. &gt;While both parties are culpable for sequestration because the Budget Control Act passed Congress, the president proposed it originally and ultimately owns its outcome. [Source]( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/24/barack-obama/obama-says-congress-owns-sequestration-cuts/) "
You mean that idea suggested to him by the House of Representatives Budget and Finance Committees because they said a flat out no to revenue increases?
"You know. Ill admit it. I thought Obama was a better option. I still do, in context of a downright crazy Republican Party. But thats the problem, I felt as he was ineffectual at best at least he will do no harm. Wrong. Under the guise of being ineffectual and passive he is vastly more damaging to the world. He is for want of a good analogy this centuries Neville chamberlain. He has in his hand a piece of paper from the NSA and secret services that they promise not to fuck americans. But you are all being fucked, and nothing you are going to do about it apart from a few reddit posts. Clap clap clap. "
The best part about this is watching Reddit try and justify being obama fan boys. O well republicans are worse. O well Romney would have been so much worse. Really? Would he have been? you dont know that and shame on people who think that

I dont think he has transformed at all. I think the American public are not wise enough to see that there are pros and cons to each of the decisions we make.

ITT: Libertarians circle-jerk and act like theyre a legitimate political philosophy.
"Obama campaign adviser, Samantha Power (now his nominee to be UN Ambassador), [made this reveal](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-502443_162-3918902-502443.html) back in 2008 while discussing Candidate Obamas plan for ending the Iraq war: &gt;He will, of course, not rely on some plan that hes crafted as a presidential candidate or a U.S. senator. He will rely upon a plan - an operational plan - that he pulls together in consultation with people who are on the ground to whom he doesnt have daily access now, as a result of not being the president. This shouldnt have been a surprise to anyone, of course. Politicians say shit to get elected. Sometimes they really mean it, but circumstances change or they gain a fuller understanding of things once they get their oval office briefings. "

"No one who did not look more deeply than at his Hope signs. No one who did not at least look into who financed his rise, Penny Pritzer and Wall Street. I voted for him once too and three days later Rubin, Geitner and Summers were installed."
"If ten years can make a whiny 15-year-old into a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, down-to-earth 25-year-old working in law, or a 20-year-old undergrad who works harder than she or he plays into a 30-year-old at the top of her or his game in engineering, or a 60-year-old well-respected psychologist whos mentally spry as hell into a 70-year-old contending with a slow descent into Alzheimers, then 10 years can change a young, eloquent, and inspiring politician into a battered, cynical president who hasnt lived up as much as he should have to many promises, both for reasons both his fault and not his fault. Im not saying that 10 years makes people the opposite of what they were, because usually it doesnt, but a lot can happen in 10 years. Ten years ago, the 18-year-old college freshmen on this website were wee 8-year-olds."

Well yes people can and did predict it. However they were not heard in over the massive amount circle jerking that was occurring by the intellectuals who voted for him

"Well, maybe we should just admit the realities you face when you actually have to do something about the issues we are facing instead of just acting morally superior from behind your keyboard inevitably change your perspective. "
"As a non-American, Im not judging you people, but you all realize that you impeached a president over a blowjob while you didnt do a thing about Bush unwarranted profiteering war and now Obamas abuses? I much prefer Democrats to Republicans, but could it be time you all stop caring about him being a Democrat and restore accountability and precedents in your country? Impeach Obama, trial Bush and others (dont aim for jail; aim for the pockets and public humiliation), **create from the ground** - and hire if need be - a fresh and bipartisan ticket having moderates appeal, with an imposed *support-conditional* agenda with at its core the all absolute priority of un-9/11 your country and push for a constitutional and accountability renaissance; systematically and irrevocably unlawing anything post-9/11 that is unconstitutional; punishing (moderately, and so realistically) those who profited by creating opportunities out of 9/11, for themselves and their ideologies. This may seem almost impossible to achieve, but it seems to me like the absolute minimum requirement to give America a descent future. Others have achieve the impossible in the past, with great profit, including your own people, and more than once. What could work is to reach for the opposite sides *moderate and sensible* voters and agree to work on what you agree on: your constitution, your rights and the need to restore accountability. Agree that your usual Democrat-Republican disputes over abortion, taxes and even weapons are worth putting aside until you get those things you agree upon back; the time to save what you both agree upon and are both losing right now. Those disputes will still be available for you all to fight over after you got back those basic things your founding fathers thought as essential and absolutely non-compromisable. We non-American often resent you for the one in your ranks belittling us and so often crossing the line between confidence and arrogance, but generally we like you and love your *original* spirit. Remember the massive feels you people got from the rest of the world on 9/11? Since then, we miss those feels probably more than most of you actually do. We want those back and the real you with them. No doubt well do when you people fix what a minority of you broke for the rest of you, and us. Obama promised you much and didnt deliver much, but dont let that beat you into defeat and acceptation. This guy sure seemed like the perfect storm for getting back on track and heal, but his failure doesnt mean theres not a real way of provoking a resurrection. The only possibility of America failing to get itself back is probably a post-Obama submission to an hope-is-bullshit sentiment. Hope isnt bullshit; trying the same things again and again is bullshit; falling for the same things again and again is bullshit; waiting for the right politician is bullshit. Money and political interests found how to get things done. Emulate and beat them at their own games. Politicians are for hire talents? Hire them and shove them your agenda in their throat. Reward them better and more than money and political interests. A government of the people by the people for the people will *never* make a comeback until the people get the best at this ugly game. Matters are too urgent for the luxury of trying to win it all while keeping your feet on the higher moral ground. Cut it. Embrace the darkside of the power game; choke those fuckers off from behind; win the game and get at its top; now youre there, change the rules while you can, so next matches of this game can be honest and moral; wash off from the darkside, but be ready to get it back if your country and constitution ever need dark knights again. **GET MAD**"

"I like to think that in 30+ years Obama will write a memoir in which he will describe clearly how his ideals were undermined by the overwhelming tide of programs already in place that he had to maintain.

I imagined both him becoming president and him continuing bushs policies. I knew this would happen because no meaningful changes in foreign policy have happened in my lifetime regardless of who has been in charge.
This is exactly what I expected from Obama. He hasnt been worse than I thought. Hes been better than I thought. But then I know what Im getting with establishment politicians.
"Is it possible that Obama has learned, as president, certain facts that might have led him to make the decisions he has?"
Im pretty sure Mike Gravel called Obama out on his bullshit during the debate. Pretty much knew he would be a smarter version of Bush.
Bullshit
"republicans started saying, less than two years after the election, that we had been duped and that obama was not what we thought. but one thing they didnt mean by that was: that he would make republicans dreams come true."
"Ha, I do find these articles amusing. Anyone could see who this man was in 2007... they chose not to."
"Great so the democrat thats in power sucks now so we can have a republican in power later that we will in turn also find out sucks and then well go back and forth. Its like 1984 where we just pretend like we are at war with this place all the time and then we change sides. Fuck this shit. Also, voting for caricatures of existing parties is a worse idea so dont tell me about libertarians or the Green Party."
if you think oboma suddenly morphed into a politicly different person then you dont know how chicago style politics work.same in 2013 as he was in 2004.
Im struck by the relative speed of his reversals. He came over to the side of big brother in weeks if not days after assuming office. Meanwhile his switch to gay marriage champion took years.
He didnt change. He was simply unknown. You couldnt have pointed to anything he had done for reference. Its very strange to think about how we took an obscure junior senator who had not served a single term and gave him the keys to the castle. This post brings up a scary point. Rewind the clock just 6 years and nobody new who thos guy was. But slews of propagandists got us. They pumped out inspiring art and slogans that had no substance. It will go down as one of the greatest mass brainwashing events ever. For god sake they gave him the peace prize before he did anything.
"Literally the -first- thing I said as soon as I heard he was going to be a presidential candidate was I bet everyone is going to actually believe his promises because he looks different, and I guarantee hell win two terms. But what do I know, Im just a crazy conservative. "
"Its called adjusting to reality. It seems crazy to you because for most of you, this is the first election you were old enough to vote in. Older redditors have seen this phenomenon of aiming for the stars and then the resulting compromise with reality played out dozens of times. Its nothing new, and it does not mean that Obama is suddenly a corporate/facist/nazi shill, and that he was a complete angel before. Reality is never that simple."
Amazing how Americans have dramatically transformed into crybaby bitches less than a decade later.
in my mind there is a corporation pointing a gun at him at all times somewhere off camera. 
"I feel as though we deserve much of the blame for the lack of progress on these issues. When we chanted Yes we can!, it seems like everyone was *really* saying Yes *he* can!. Its as if we expect the system to change itself. But if you pay attention to Obamas speeches, it was always about what we collectively can accomplish, which makes a lot of sense considering the man was a community organizer for so long. I just dont see any pressure on the man to act, but give him credit: when there has been, hes listened. On healthcare, on gun control, and on foreign policy. If there was as much pressure to prosecute crooked bankers as there was to end the war in Iraq. This is on us. Make no mistake about it. If we want Change, we the people need to actually make it happen. Obama himself said as much, before and after his election (and re-election)."
"I dont think there was transformation, its just election-campaigning-persona and then in-power-persona. Edit: But I have to say, I had more hope in him than any of the previous presidents."
No one could have imagined...anyone with a fucking brain could have. He is a politician.
So why do you think hes changed? What does he now know that changed his opinion regarding privacy so drastically? 
Yawn
And what was the alternative? Take a gamble on President Palin?
"I want to read this, but that on swipe thing keeps popping up. Edit: Im on my iPad."
i dont see any evidence that Obama has morphed into a Richard Nixon. He might be boxed in by some ugly political realities but he seems pretty consistent.
"Im really tired of naive, utopian Redditors and their unenlightened critiques of the supposedly-corrupted Obama. People in my generation (Im 22) need to read some books about the national security apparatus and the transition from Bush to Obama. Obama knew very little about national security threats when he campaigned for the presidency, but that changed when he started getting his daily briefings. True, he made some serious about-faces, but thats when happens when mostly-uninformed idealism (a.k.a. a good portion of this subreddit) meets cold, hard reality. I am not an Obama apologist, but I think its important to recognize the challenge he faces even if we dont excuse every action that results from it. He is trying to square his constitutional-law background and deep animosity toward Bush-era secrecy with the reality of governing a complicated and frequently-targeted country in an age where the enemy doesnt wear a uniform or have a defense ministry."
"Fuckers. Its all a big fucking game. Why is it so hard to believe the rich control the world? Why, why, why? MONEY and POWER."
The better option isnt necessarily a good one. 
"I knew. I watched that speech at the democratic convention, live. And I said that night that he was full of crap and that he would very likely be president. It was scary, because he said all the right things and with the cadence of a minister."
"Here is a news flash most redditors and Americans in general do not want to here. Most people complaining dont even pay attention to national politics, dont pay attention to what their congressmen are doing. What do you think is going to happen the government going to work efficiently and in our best interest just because they care. If you want to change you dont vote out a President you replace a majority of the congress, because that is where the one place the people have the most voice. When your society can tell you the names of the Kardashians, name all of Brad Pitts children, yet dont even know the names of their congressmen, or even take the time to see what major policy decisions are being done. Well democracy has failed, and the top 1% will continue to use divide and conquer to get what they want since most Americans are stupid and lazy to care. "
"Id like to think everyone around him in our corrupt government forced him to change. Id like to think he got into office and things were a completely different world than he thought, and he couldnt live up to all of his promises because of it."
"About time to put on my Dont blame me, I voted for gary Johnson! bumper sticker "
Worse than Bush 
"I did, and its naive to believe otherwise."
"While the rest of us intelligent humans saw right through his fucking facade. Dont you feel so fucking stupid for voting for him now? If the answer is no, you were deprived of the short bus growing up. "
Ron Paul warned us about it.
Oh dear.
"Obama always reminded me of Michael Corleone. Young, idealistic, inspiring, way more competent than all the idiots around him. But once he gets involved, he figures out that the reason why people make the choices they do isnt just because theyre idiots, its the logic of the system that they live in. If he wants to be the best (and goddamnit, he does), hes going to be the best within that system. Yes, always, he says that hes going to change everything, but somehow the changes just seem to entrench the system even further."
"Bullshit. Myself and half my friends called this during the first campaign. Circle jerk aside I am not a racist, a redneck, well off, hardcore republican or any other of many things. I just dont fall for some ultra liberal past based politician claiming he will do anything other than the big government crap his predecessor was hated for. "
"I think its hilarious all the Obama supporters talking down to everyone with smug self satisfaction, look at you now. RON PAUL all the way!"
Where can I sign the Impeach vote?
Would it make sense to impeach him? Blows my mind Clinton got impeached for a bj and whats Obama get for this?

"As I have stated in other posts, no president will ever have the power to do what they promised. No president ever. Presidents are controlled by the wealthy to advance their agendas. The politicians are just a facade to keep us thinking that we have a voice in our governance, but we dont. Presidents make $400,000 a year. Compare that to the millions of dollars that CEOs make. Now think what you can do with millions of dollars. You can hire plenty of skilled hitmen that can murder ANYONE regardless of what protection they have. That is the power that money gives them. Politicians know this, and thats why they accept to help the corrupt wealthy people instead of opposing them. The few politicians that do say no to these people are very little threat, and hence do not get murdered. Money rules the world. Either reject it or be ruled by it."
"My hand was up and waving, but I was called a racist and was ostracized. Sooooooo I shut up, and I was able to keep my job. "
Looool. This is all I have to say.
"Better late than never. Maybe in another ten years hell actually support, maybe, kinda, not voting for a Democrat or a Republican. Maybe in ten years hell realized we shouldve impeached him."
Id like to find out what exactly happened between 2004 and 2013 to Barack Obama. What caused him to Change?
":YAWN: Only dipshits that have no idea how the *real world* works thought that Obama would end the wars immediate, push through universal coverage, instantly close down Gitmo, and kill the Patriot Act. Anyone with a brain knows that that is not how politics works. You need bi-partisan support for most things (remember who holds the purse strings?), and the GOP has been more against *anything* this President has wanted than any other President in history. There are also potentially big reasons why something like the Patriot Act is still around - seems like the very same people that are now feigning outrage (even though the PA has been around for some *12 years* now), would also be the very first people asking where was the gobment? if some big terrorist event actually happened. Yeah, sorry folks, but when the general public wasts the White Houses time by proposing we fund a Death Star (a la Star Wars), then you guys kind of prove that you cant take matters seriously. Oh yeah, and keep on posting every detail of your life on FaceBook, but then pretend that the gobment knowing things about it is somehow out of line. In a country that has been moving to the right for 30+ years now, and a President who has had his hands tied by a worthless Congress, Obama has gotten a shit ton of stuff accomplished, so sorry if I dont jump on the weekly Hater-ade train. "
Hen was like this from the start when he rigged his election to be Ill. state senator.
"Yes they could, and did."
"I wouldnt have expected it then, but I knew in the primary that he voted against habeus corpus, voted to renew the Patriot Act, voted for a bill that would allow war with Iran, etc. I never expected he would be *worse* than Bush when it came to these things, but I did at least expect he would be as bad. You all should have done your research and seen it coming at least a little more."
Power corrupts. Not big surprise. People were fooled yet again. Also not big Surprise.
Sure they did. Most intelligent people that have voted in more than one election know that any major party nominee is always corrupt
"Id laugh at how easily you pathetic twits were conned by this piece of shit, except that you will be just as easily conned by the next charismatic lying sack of shit. Fucking idiots."
Its funny that the demos couldnt see what the republicans could but what did the republicans offer? A rock could have run against a demo in 2008 and won. Sheeple. 
I could. Hes a fucking politician. 
"I always remember that speech with disgust - both for Obama and the Democratic rank-and-file generally. He articulated a philosophy of compromise even back then, and clueless dems lapped it up. No one spoke about the real problem: the right wing had gone crazy. Of the senior Democratic leadership, Al Gore was the only one who got close to identifying real problems and real solutions. And now, we can look forward to 2016 when these idiots will nominate Hillary."
"OOh fucking Waahh. Actually, people DID imagine this. And sadly for you Redditors, one of them was [Alex Jones.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaQNACwaLw) (I know how much we hate him. Downvote all you want, but at least watch and think for yourself.)"
"Republicans cant just keep flaunting their tactics as reason to blame their opponents, thats gay."
So why did so many people still buy what this liar was selling in 2012?

"I was a fanatical Obama supporter in 2008, thinking he was the reincarnation of FDR. His whole presidency has been one huge let-down after another. It seems like somewhere between 2004 and 2008 he sold his soul to Wall Street. I have become convinced that change through the ballot box is impossible. Even well-meaning reformers like Obama become corrupted by the system. Only a grass-roots social revolution based on direct action against the 1% will change anything. National strikes, 100,000+ marches of armed armed protestors in Washington DC and in state capitals and corporate HQs, Alternative communities, direct worker takeover of their workplaces, etc."
No one? Oh you mean how Clinton turned from liberal to NAFTA supporting conservative? Yes... nobody...
"I expect to get down-voted for this, but fuck it. I voted for Barack Obama because I liked what I heard from him about foreign policy, the environment, and healthcare. I never once expected him to change the Bush administrations policies on intelligence gathering (he voted for FISA). So far he has delivered on what I expected. I knew I wasnt voting for a liberal, I wanted a moderate after 8 years of Bush Administration bullying. Im glad my Presidents a moderate, and while I didnt, and still dont agree with some of his policies, I got what I voted for and am patient enough to know that it doesnt end with his administration."
"Uninformed voters winged it, and this is what we ended up with. "
"As an American I hereby pledge that I will only consider a candidates qualifications, plan and leadership ability while ignoring race, gender or sexual orientation. We elected a black guy to feel good about ourselves, now we pay the piper. Affirmative action got Obama into Columbia and Harvard and left us with an unqualified president. No mas. "
I must be the only person who cant read the fucking article! What the fuck
Obama to Reagan look at how they bent to their training. 
"A far better man than Bill Clinton yet we are not giving him the support we gave zipper man... WE know the attacks began before he took office, every day attack, attack, attack. You must be made to hate the man you elected. You MUST NOT make noise and support him. . . . . I am so sad at how thoughtful intelligent people do not understand that the elected voice has not been heard since 1980. And will not as long as we allow it. "
Vote Libertarian.
"Yeah, because Jounalism is a very trusted profession these days too.. everyone is full of shit and this article sounds like someone trying to cash in on the I was right the whole time card when its bullshit to play that card too. NSA Scandel are you kidding me? Sit the fuck down you overblown idiot. Stop trying to stir the shit with a stick and maybe try to offer a solution instead of some whimsical fuckwit message about how you were right and oh my god we thought this guy was going to save the world even though some people are doing nothing but throwing every road block in the way to stop progress of any sort. The sad part is how a good amount of the comments below are just a big circle jerk - a patriotic circle jerk in where the black man was wrong the whole time. This website is now the generic public opinion site, no longer home to the outside of the box thinkers. Only here to be another news outlet or another way of dumping in cash to help promote some elses agenda. Game over man, game over. "
Obama is as bad as Dick darth vader Cheney.
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/
Except for every republican ever. I love how they were called racist for not liking Obama. Liberals looking like a bunch of idiots. You cant say shit to anyone who voted for Bush. 
"LOL - So glad I voted for Gary Johnson on the Libertarian ticket and have voted 3rd party way back since Bush 1 at every level of government when possible and when its not possible I make sure to vote against long standing incumbents. Anyways I feel my vote was a principled vote based on my own views of economic and social liberties espoused by Gary and guys like Ron Paul and their logical and common sense view on desiring a much more limited and restrained federal government. It was a vote that now has made me feel oh so much better once I realize that I dont have to wash off or drink away the shame/stink of voting for a flat out two faced liar like Obama (or what Romney would of been if elected). This new Obama scandal and those that have preceded it just keep on justifying this view over and over again. Call it smugness, call it whatever you want but at the end of the day I know I made the right decision compared to the majority of the US population who votes lock step like drones/lemmings for both parties who continually sell them out everytime they get a chance to do so. All because these folks have been caught up in the fear-mongering populist cheerleading bullshit espoused by the two big parties."
"As the Greeks understood, you cannot put Agape (Love) before Logos (Reason). Love only grows *out* of Reason. This has always been the fatal mistake of the left, and it is a deadly reversal of the true Dialectec. What was the last of the horrors in Pandoras Box? Hope. Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs mans torment. Friedrich Nietzsche BTW, you people truly are sheep and you deserve everything thats coming to you."
and no one said the same thing about george w. bush? or maybe even nixon..?
"Give me a break. What do people expect out of the post of Presidency? It is one man in a series of checks and balances that are imbalanced because of the two-party system (or rather, in a grid-lock). Just because you elect the progressive black man doesnt mean the whole system is going to benefit as a result. "
No one . . Ahem . . 
"That just shows how powerful the system is. Oh, you like this guy? Cool, watch what we do once we own him. "
I voted for Obama in 2012. I will not vote Democrat again. I will not vote for anyone again. Obama has tainted politics forever for me.
Obama supporters were convinced by a three word slogan. Now theyre upset and feel betrayed? They collectively have the IQ of a carrot.
"All I see are people clamoring for change. Boo Bush sucked I want Obama, Boo Obama sucks, hes a traitor! Well guess what guys, we live in a democracy, not an autocracy. The President has a LIMITED amount of power. When Congress obstructs legilastion at historic highs, the President has even less power. The President cant magically make laws disappear. Politics is a dirty fucking game. You have to lie your way in, you have to act like youre the next Jesus and youre going to save the country. Now of course every President makes ridiculous promises that they cant keep. Our government has to go through many, many, MANY routes to initiate anything. Politics is like a maze and its really tough for things to get through efficiently. Its a constant war between Dem and Reb. "
This article can be summed up in 3 words: Follow the money.
I did.
"No one in that hall in Boston in 2004 could have imagined that the young, eloquent and inspiring politician would have transformed so dramatically less than a decade later. Maybe no one in that hall had any ability to understand that to get elected you need to be someone that plays the game, and that playing the game means you need to behave yourself and do as your master tell you. Those of us who know that the President is not the one with the real power, that it is a combination of big business and big lobbies which really run the show, have known that Obama would be nothing like the person he pretended to be originally. THEY NEVER ARE."
"And next up for auction the candidate from Illinois. Well start the bidding at $1,000,000. Do I hear $2,000,000? "
as i mentioned before : the USA got the leader it deserves. Blame yourself not Obama - he hasnt changed a bit. 
Um - yes they could. Ask any Ron Paul supporter and they will tell you exactly what they were thinking in 2008.
"So now hes the fallen hero clich? lol You people should be focusing on the administration and congress, because Obamas just a puppet. He has no real power."
The personality cults surrounding the american presidents is not much different to what is happening in N.Korea. Its perhaps a bit less extreme but all the mechanisms are the same and it is becoming more and more extreme. Its sad that people put so much trust in a single leader...
[deleted]
The question is this: who is brainwashing the Presidents and how are they doing it?
Dont overgeneralize. I saw through all his lies and evil lurking inside. Not everyone is that blind
See that political party hes tied to? Itsa big sign screaming Im not any different. People actually believe theres some huge difference between the parties. They only vary slightly by the rights they want to take away. If you keep believing in the same system that got us here then youre part of the problem.
From the great black hope to the great black dope. How this dude was re-elected blows-my-fucking-mind.
total. bullshit. reddit is truly clueless.
"1. The laws and policies of the United States are built on precedent. The system is purposely designed so that it is very hard to make any changes at all, impossible for radical change. 2.The unofficial structure of the government, including the two party system, is run by private self-interested money, their tireless lobbyist, single focused Generals and the good ol boy network including people who influence what passes for information, fact and public opinion. 3.The number 1 duty of a President is the responsibility for maintaining the security of the American people. You cannot fail to take every effort to that because any lapse opens you up to a failed administration and the loss of the office for your party. 4.The President and his administration are sworn to enforce the law, whatever the law the Congress makes. People who are vastly disappointed in Obama were just very naive about the real power of the Presidency; especially coming off 8 years of paranoia induced policy and with an intentionally obstructive Congress. He is not a dictator, he does not make law, he has no jawboning sway over Congressmen who assure their local election by opposing him on every issue. I still trust Mr. Obama to make the best choices he can within the context of what he can choose."
We really need a second political party in this country.
Half of the country that voted against him could have imagined this. It was pretty fucking easy to see through his bullshit if you werent mesmerized with his coolness.
I dropped 80% of my expectations when he was elected and I was still disappointed. Hes a miserable failure.
"Thats bullshit, lots of people predicted this but none of you were willing to listen."
He didnt transform. HES A CHICAGO POLITICIAN. I saw right through his bullshit in 08 and tried to warn everyone. But you all fell for it like sheeple. There will NEVER be a real legitimate president for the people ever again. Any candidate who has a real shot and says he is is a bold faced liar.
My President got Universal healthcare passed and hundreds of other things I like. Most of this with an opposition party whos stated goal was to make the President fail even if it hurt the country. Whomever had a messiah complex for the President was unrealistic but things are much better than if he had lost either of his elections. Which is the real alternative people dont seem to talk about. Here is a link to a sarcastic site about Obama has done. http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/
"Hes always been a corporate big government neocon mouthpiece, but the media only went after him after their rights had been violated. "
"If the whole NSA thing had come out before the election, no way he wouldve won a second term. "
"It just reaffirms my belief that it is the system thats broken, not the people. I have no doubt that Obama believed in his message and that he believed that once elected he could effect change. And I dont think its just Obama who was so hopeful. Im going to go out on a limb and say that most people who decide to make the jump into politics have that same hopefulness and belief right up until they are elected. And then they get swallowed up by the machine. Corporations and special interests (read: money) have a stranglehold on politics. I dont know how to fix the system but it seems to me that campaign finance reform is the place to start. Not sure how to handle the primary election campaign finance, but I would love it if each candidate in a general election received an equal amount of public funds and let the chips fall where they may. And I would cap it at one million per candidate. Simplistic? Indeed. Unrealistic? For sure. But what the hell? One can dream, cant one?"
"From the methodology, it looks like they took the 5 cheapest pre-ACA rates and compared them to the 5 cheapest post-ACA rates. A bit of a glitch in this is that the cheapest rates pre-ACA are the ones getting canceled for non-compliance, since they didnt cover enough. To be fair, in the cite of the cite they adjusted for people who couldnt get coverage pre-ACA by assuming the plans would cost 3 times as much. Quote; Eight states will enjoy average premium reductions under Obamacare: New York (-40%), Colorado (-22%), Ohio (-21%), Massachusetts (-20%), New Jersey (-19%), New Hampshire (-18%), Rhode Island (-10%), and Indiana (-3%).

(Believe it or not, we?ve had success mining data from every exchange website but Hawaii?s.) This nearly-complete analysis finds that the average state will face underlying premium increases of 41 percent. Men will face the steepest increases: 77, 37, and 47 percent for 27-year-olds, 40-year-olds, and 64-year-olds, respectively.

What the actual fuck. That picture of their vehicle alone should have gotten them fired. What is wrong with this country. 
Then please explain to me how this law will reduce gun crime.
"&gt;The argument is if there are ALREADY dozens of laws against something, passing an additional law will accomplish essentially nothing. Point me to the law already on the books against owning a new weapon without an imprint capability... bet you cant. Your arguments seem retarded because they *are* retarded. Gun nuts lump every single law that pertains to guns into a single law and then just refers to that as dozens of laws against the same thing. Why do we need a law against running red lights when we already have dozens of traffic laws?"
"Thank you. Its the most fucking retarded argument, but every gun nut and their mother makes it all the fucking time."
"Heres a genuine argument. Take speeding for example. We create speed limits. People ignore those limits. Police now begin enforcing the speed limit and issuing tickets. Traffic laws are enforced all the time. Murder is enforced all the time. Rape is enforced all the time. Gun law violations? Rarely. Remember only 44 people were prosecuted out of 80,000 that got rejected on the FBI background check. Gun laws arent enforced, so what will adding more laws do? http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2013/mar/22/kelly-ayotte/most-people-trying-buy-gun-illegally-us-senator-ke/****"
"It only *seems* retarded because you dont understand (or deliberately misusnderstand) the argument. Youre responding to the liberal straw man version of it, which is actually kind of retarded on your part. The argument is **if there are ALREADY dozens of laws against something**, passing an additional law will accomplish essentially nothing. This is simply and quite obviously a fact. "
"agreed. its beyond a fucking joke. pathetic arguments are pathetic. hey look, over there in the rest of the civilized western world, gun control is working all over the place. #freedumb #USA"
Laws dont reduce crime. Enforcement of laws reduces crime.
Same link as mine. Thats why I specified reading the analysis and the dates Cheney received the payments. ;)

They are a reflection only of increased share price, unless there is a dividend distributed to share holders. Walmart is capitalized at 3.28 billion share, currently priced at $77.80 a share. So if you had purchased 100 shares at todays prices, it would cost you $7780.00, not bad, an expense of almost $8000 earning a bit over 6% in a year, to earn YOU $500. You are welcome to do the math yourself, here is the link. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=WMT You are welcome to purchase as many as you choose, so YOU TOO can become a wealthy capitalist and RISK your money on your knowledge and willingness to make a profit, or maybe a loss. "
"The Waltons own a lot of shares. 51.17%. If they held less than 50% then they would not control the store. Despite what Sanders tweets, how is it going to help you by forcing the Waltons to Share their wealth? Keep in mind that this wealth is USED, not just sat on. This is an accumulation of two generations. Do you honestly think that there should be a maximum amount of money that any family should be allowed to earn? "
"The entire point of public policy is to create a better society by dissecting and predicting how households/ firms will REACT to changes in the law. By your logic, if the government were to place a 100% tax on a corporation, it would be the corporations fault for closing. By your logic, the policymaker takes no blame for the failures of the War on Drugs. By your logic, the policymaker takes no blame for the housing bubble."
"If you click the other link on the page you will find this: &gt;As we have previously noted, many Americans already lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law. Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan. &gt;How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population switched health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching... So, accepting Politifacts numbers, 4 million out of 250 million people lost their insurance by insurers who claim the ACA was the cause. Thats 1.6% of insured people. If you make a statement, that at one time both Obama and [Politifact believed to be true](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/barack-obama/obamas-plan-expands-existing-system/)... Can a statement that is: * believed to be true * and actually turns out to be true for 98.4% of people * and is dependent on a decision at least partially controlled insurers * and its not unusual for 14+% of people to lose their insurance in any given year can this really be the lie of the year? Sounds like hyperbole to me."
"Im sorry... but what planet are you from? Certainly not this one. If the government mandates that plans must cover A, B, and C... then logically, plans that dont meet those requirements would have to be canceled. But what about grandfathering you might ask? &gt;But the Department of Health and Human Services then wrote regulations that narrowed that provision, by saying that if any part of a policy was significantly changed since that date -- the deductible, co-pay, or benefits, for example -- the policy would not be grandfathered. [Especially in light of two-three week old revelations that the Administration knew it was lying when it promised that everyone that liked their health care could keep it.](http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/28/21213547-obama-admin-knew-millions-could-not-keep-their-health-insurance)"
"I wonder if people complained about their doctor retiring as being evidence against if you like your doctor you can keep seeing your doctor? Did they expect Obama to nationalize insurance? That would have been nice, but its the only way to force someone into still selling a service. Clearly he was referring to that the law wouldnt cancel existing plans. The law obviously didnt force companies to keep selling those plans. "
"Ahhhh those insurance policies were illegal under Obamacare, thats why they were cancelled. It wouldve been illegal to keep those policies in place. "
"Ah, so we use politifact to our advantage when it makes a republican look bad but simply say youre wrong when it paints Obama as your typical politics? Sweet, sweet /r/politics. I think they took this place from the frontpage because of all the enlightenment."
Thats false.
"Its true, but he shouldve noted it instead of repeating you will get to keep your current plan over and over."
"Yeah, As much as I fucking hate the circle jerk in /r/politics, this time I read the article and was kind of surprised. How can that be lie of the year? First of all from the specific wording you can keep it. is objectively true. You could keep your policy. But if you take the meaning to be It is entirely your choice to keep it or not. Then yes you could say that is false. However being objective I would put that as sort of false, because I think the phrase you can implies it is a personal elective. However the truth is that it requires both you and your insurance companies compliance. The you can is certainly not true but lie of the year? No. Especially since the healthcare debate happened mostly in 2009, and I feel like something more relevant to 2013 would be were not spying on innocent american citizens."
"Anybody who looked closely at ACA knew that the statement was false. He promised something he simply had no way to guarantee. And its always been that way - this is not something thats new under ACA. I hope the law works (as a first step towards a much simpler, better solution), and Ive voted for Obama twice and wouldnt change those votes, but this was a biggie that never should have been uttered. Although, since he hasnt said it since 2009 Im not sure why its the 2013 LOTY. But it is the most notorious lie thats been newsworthy this year. "
"No Obama did not lie, because its just absurd that anyone thought Obama was guaranteeing he was going to force private corporations they could never cancel their insurance plans. Neither Obama nor the GOP foresaw that companies were going to gleefully cancel plans they didnt have to. Because (1) if the GOP had foreseen this they would have made it a central issue from the start, and (2) its not like Obama had some sort of secret privileged information the GOP didnt have or the average person didnt have."
You are absurdly ignorant if you think the new laws have nothing to do with insurance companies changing or canceling their plans.
Shill
"So Politifact notes that nothing in the new law prevents insurance companies from offering the same old plans indefinitely - that it was entirely their choice to cancel any plans they cancelled - and then calls Obamas statement a lie, as if he, and not insurers, was in any way responsible for the cancellation of plans. Okay."
The way I understood it they couldnt change the plan in any way what so ever and since each year plans are tweaked and changed it would invalidate it from being grandfathered in. These changes happen every year but most are fairly minor and doesnt affect the scope of the plan itself. Thats how plans work and if you accept that these changes are a part of your plan then yes its a lie because you arent unable to keep your plan.
"The statement is still false. You can justify it however you like, but politifact can only remain neutral by objectively stating whether or not a statement is true. Obama said that the healthcare bill would not interfere with peoples choice to keep their old plan if they wanted to, and that wasnt true. He didnt qualify his statement with unless your insurance company changes the plans they offer in response to the healthcare overhaul. Neglecting to mention that insurance companies would likely modify the plans they offer in response to such a significant restructuring of our healthcare system is something that the Obama administration should be held accountable for. Surely this was not a surprise for them; how do they expect insurance companies to modify their practices to transition to a new healthcare system without changing some of the plans they offer? But Ill bet it *was* a surprise for many average Americans who have minimal knowledge about either Obamacare or the healthcare industry in general. If a conservative had said something this misleading, reddit would be unanimous in its condemnation. Blaming insurance companies for adapting to a new system in a very predictable manner is ridiculous."
"I promise the government is not going to take your car away {someone steals your car} Internet commenter: Its a lie because Obama had no power to grant it. He couldnt promise no one would steal your car, so it was a lie to do so Me: {facepalm} "
"Because the law was set-up such that it was *inevitable* and entirely predictable that this would occur. Youre right that, in theory it was possible to keep the plans going. But the completely expected outcome of the set of regulations would be that most of these policies would go away. So, if youd like to say it was the insurance companies choice, I have no problem with that. But, by the same token, either Obama was naive/stupid or lying for telling the American people only one specific potential outcome that could have resulted. Again, this was largely predictable."
"Oh cmon, you know that people dont care about facts?!? Death panels, socialism and birth certificates are the rage man!"
"The president didnt sell the law as We will not force companies to cancel your plan if you like it. -- he sold it as if you like your plan you can keep it. period. You note that theres nothing in the law that prevents insurance companies from offering the same old plans (though politifact seems to disagree with that given the strict grandfathering rules), but theres nothing in the law that forces insurance companies to continue the policies either. Absent a mandate for continued coverage and/or a provision where the government would service cancelled contracts, its deceitful (at best) to guarantee everyone would be able to keep their plan if they liked it."
"Its a lie namely because Obama had no power to grant it. If I promised that Bill Gates was going to give you a billion dollar or your employer isnt going to fire you I would be lying. It was a lie, it was a blatant lie, and the only problem with Politifact calling this out is they didnt do it sooner. Like after the 37 times he said it. I suppose one could argue that Obama didnt intend to for it to be taken literally, but wanted people to hear it as If you like your plan Obamacare wont make you give it up, but insurers can still be asshats. However, I say you should be freaking accurate when you talk. You arent George W Bush. You can speak English well Mr. President. "
"When you say something simple, it should have simple implications. If youd bought insurance in the last two years, the implications are not at all simple. Its a devil-in-the-details thing, and we nailed Romney and Ryan on that sort of lie by omission during their campaign a kajillion times. It was said to reassure when the actual outcome for millions deserved representation. I dun even care whether ends justify the means here when were talking about whether a person lied by omission."
"The law made it financially impossible for insurance companies to keep offering all of the same plans, so yeah I would consider it a lie. What about the inexpensive plans that offered minimum coverage? Those are gone now since they are deemed insufficient by the ACA."
"And the electoral vote, if honestly counted."
"Um, no. http://www.factcheck.org/2008/01/the-florida-recount-of-2000/"
"Maybe you ought to read that linked page, which correctly notes that the very comprehensive study found that Gore would have won if all ballots had been properly and fairly counted (to say nothing of factors such as the butterfly ballot which diverted many thousands of votes away from him)."

"&gt;We have this other plan were we kill all the bloated and inefficient programs like welfare and food stamps, These programs have little overhead, but it would indeed be more efficient to have a basic income scheme.

I think I might be that guy. 
"Basic income sounds very nice, I mean it has its downsides obviously, but its just mind boggling that these ideas are never implemented."
"the 10s of millions of americans who are only making $20,000 a year certainly would. "
"What would the tax rate be to support a basic income? It sounds like it would be prohibitively expensive, but thats speculation. Basic income would be a bold experiment. Raising the minimum wage slightly isnt an experiment, its just good economic policy."

Good idea. Why dont you do it?
Doesnt [politifact](http://www.politifact.com) sort of do this already?
"We should do this with economists as well. A while back there was a study of economic projections (I think by Australian national audit people or something similar) and they found the official predictions/projections were *worse* than random guesses. Actually, we should do this with pretty much anyone trying to make money from predictions. And then we need to teach everyone about statistics and probability, so they can understand who is likely lying to them and who not to give money to. Although by the time the predictions dont come true it is often too late."
Good point
Somebody needs to keep track of politicians predictions and give statistics like percent accuracy. Maybe then theyd cry wolf a little less.
"Im not American, and politicians where I am tend to be a little more low key. Im positive they still lie and exaggerate, but its less overt."
"Id think the truth is more important than the source. Its ironic, but the US wont solve its own problems by staring and pointing at Russia."
"Man, I wish I lived in Russia where the government supports civil liberties and isnt controlled by billionaire oligarchs. Instead, Im stuck here in the dumb ol USA. Fortunately, Voice of Russia is a not-at-all propagandistic beacon of truth, giving a fair and balanced view of America."
"Posted this in the thread trunk, but Im sure it will go nowhere: 20% of Americans have negative net worth. This isnt about how much money the top has, its about how 60 million Americans are in net debt, and frankly I think this is a more powerful/insightful statistic. I, some schmuck whos doing pretty well but no way near the top 1% or top 500, has more wealth than the 85 million poorest combined in the US. And you could spin this all you want, the poorest in the U.S. are worse off than the poorest in India, because no one loans money to the poorest in India. Some homeless dude on the street in the U.S. has more wealth than 80 million Americans combined. The amount of debt Americans take on and never get themselves out of is insane, and a huge contributor to the problem of inequality. Compounding interest is a great thing if you have positive assets, and a terrible thing if you owe money. Lesson: statistics quoted in headlines with no context mean very little. But you do learn a lot if you dig past the spin."

It was M. Moore and 400 Americans versus half of all Americans. Sooo, 400 versus about 150 million? I cannot seem to find anything else at the moment via Google but questionable links. However, I am sure a focused search of the BLS and the institutions mentioned in the article could turn up numbers more agreeable with Brands statement. "

Yet when someone from Fox says something progressive, everyone hails that person as someone who is standing up and doing the right thing in an environment where youd think they couldnt. You morons need to stay focused on the message, because its what matters."
Little support? See the comments above yours which link to multiple polls showing **majority support** for single-payer. Nice revisionism.
"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/01/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-majority-favor-single-payer-h/ Heres politifact pretty much debunking the notion entirely. You can cherry pick any polls you wish, but to deny reality is just pathetic."
"its only fair, both parties have gone right."
"This. Theyve been calling politifact liberal, despite it being a fairly good measure of neutral. Now its moving to the right by the demands of the media."
"I dont know if that is true or not, but it certainly feels like it. They got blasted by the republican party a few years ago because most of the statements by republicans were rated as false and only like 2/3 of statements from democrats were rated as false. They seem to have gone downhill over the last few years making efforts to appear bipartisan. But even some of their analysis of democrat lies have been somewhat awful."
"Its always had a right wing tilt. Its a white hat organization, a partisan outfit designed to appear neutral/disinterested and therefore credible. But what always happens is that the partisans in charge cant give even an inch of ground and lose the subtlety necessary to pull off the deception."
"Also, Gohmert is obviously graded on a curve. He is just barely smart enough to tie his own shoes and everyone knows it. I think he got extra credit just for knowing of the existence of Wall Street."

"Politifact.com has been moving to the right to appease right-wing criticism. Years ago, they used to be nicely neutral, but their fear of right-wing criticism by the corporate media has forced them to the right."
Why appease these people?
Left of your extreme right-wing perspective does not mean left of center.
"Yeah, pretty much. NPR/PBS has made some effort to focus on facts, but when Diane Rhem has a panel of right-wingers spewing lies that are not checked, i have to wonder about the sincerity of neutrality claim."
"Hahaha *WHAT*? Politifact has always leaned slightly LEFT, while factcheck.org has always been solidly in the MIDDLE. (Why do you think Politifact is always cited in this subreddit instead of factcheck.org?) Neither leans RIGHT."
Sort of NPR eh?
Yep anything that the hivemind disagrees with is obviously not credible and ran by right wing Koch shills. I wonder if Reagan or Bush is to blame for this? Could Reagan still be alive and controlling all corporate media? We need Sanders and Warren to comment on how we need to do something about this but not actually act upon their comments.

"&gt;They just want people to prove they are who they say they are. They already did this when they registered.

Felons dont go to gun stores to buy guns.
"The last time I went to vote, I just had to give my name and address. I didnt have to prove that I actually was who I said I was. That is the problem. I dont think photo ID is enough.

The vast majority of spending is from Republican programs. As for a single payer system, the math works out quite nicely. I didnt say we wouldnt collect more taxes. I said collect taxes as if we werent a single payer system, i.e. payments for private insurance are converted to taxes. Our current national health expenditures are $2.6 trillion. The cost of a single payer system is around $1.2 trillion a year. If we collect $2.6 trillion in taxes per year rather than $1.2 trillion the system actually costs (theres no change here in the amount of money an individual is spending...just changing it from pay to the private sector to pay into a single payer system), were left with a $1.4 trillion difference there. With the current deficit shrinking and down to $630 billion this year, if we implemented the system before the baby boomers start to really retire in 2016, we would have an immediate surplus that goes entirely to the debt. Debt costs shrink and at the same time, federal spending on interest on the debt shrinks. This lowers our annual spending. In around 18 years (give or take a few years), the debt would be paid off completely. Its just a fact that the government can provide health care coverage at a much cheaper price than the private sector. And thats the advantage of a single payer system. "
"Read Krugman on SNAP (food stamps): http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/more-snap-judgments/ Read his whole post, not just the graph, and note he denominates by GDP. Yes, it is higher today, because were in a depressed economy. But the long-term trend thru 2008 was lower spending relative to earlier years. Calling out that these social safety net programs are at all time highs, during a time of extended economic depression, is really missing the forest for the trees. The spending is supposed to be high, it is designed to be that way, and if you buy into its at an all time high, when will it end without looking at the long term trends, then youre being misled. The number of unwed **teen** mothers today is actually much lower than it was in the past. True, the rate is high in the African American community, but the overall trend in the most at-risk group, the teen moms, has been going down for decades. https://www.russellsage.org/sites/all/files/Furstenberg_chap1_0.pdf See graph on page 9. That woman leaves her husband is an issue, but she often leaves for good reason. That doesnt mean the unwed child-bearing rate in African American women is not an issue, but keep in mind that when you see the statistic unwed moms theres a lot of those moms who left abusive situations, or men who have abandoned their accountabilities. Those mens economic status improves while the women and children suffer. Look at Pell grants. You can poo-poo that and say it is not a welfare program, but it is a high quality investment opportunity to fund college-level education. I was Pell grant eligible back in the day. Used to be that Pell grants could cover your tuition. Not any more: http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid/figures-tables/fed-aid-maximum-pell-grant-percentage-total-charges-over-time And this gets directly at your issue of supply and demand of labor. The very programs that would create a supply of higher quality labor have been cut, both at the federal level, and also at the state level, particularly in Red states. The withdrawal of state funding for college education over the past 20 years is abysmal. Who now funds the higher education of that single Black mom? Private, for-profit degree mills that fool her into thinking there is a job for her where she can repay the loan. Wait, lets hold those private for-profit degree mills accountable! You can see how everyone has rallied to Elizabeth Warrens battle flag on that one. The overall union wage difference is closer to 23% and that is before you factor in fringe benefits. Also, you just compared Boston to North Carolina. Is there some reason why you chose Boston rather than say Pittsfield, a working class community that is more comparable to say Greenville NC? Im talking apples to apples, compare like communities, dont pull Boston out of your ass unless you are willing to compare it to Washington DC. On top of that, union membership gives you job security -- it is an intangible, but it is real. You also get a much more predictable rate of pay increase, as well as defined training benefits. I also do account for union dues, as does the research on this matter. I was a union member at one time, by chance it saved me about $45,000 dollars by standing up for my health care coverage rights relative to faculty members at peer institutions who were not organized and whose administrators simply dropped that benefit because they were told they could do it -- the workers had collective bargaining rights, no contractual claim to those benefits. Look, its been a good exchange, youve been respectful and have granted that Ive made some good points. Ive been watching this unfold for decades while moving from the middle class to the upper class. I know how much I have benefited from federal programs, union protection, and low capital gains taxes and tax shelters along the way. Yes, supply and demand in the labor market is an important thing, but having basic food and shelter was not a problem for veterans returning from WWII -- we had a social safety net that gave them a house on campus (granted, often a shack, but they loved it) and enough money to attend college AND support a small family AND low cost business development loans. If you want to see when the social safety net was in its prime, look at how we cared for WWII veterans in the late 1940s thru the 1950s, and how the economy grew. Then look for something like that today."
"I do plenty of volunteer work. What I think has changed is social make up. For example, there are far more single mothers today than in the past, mainly among African-Americans unfortunately: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/don-lemon/cnns-don-lemon-says-more-72-percent-african-americ/ Things like single-motherhood make it harder for families to make ends meet. It also leads to lower education results, and other things that drive the poverty cycle. If you could, please point to a Federal welfare program that gets less funding now than before. Food stamps, disability, etc... are at all time highs, in addition we just ended the longest extension of unemployment benefits in a long time. What about the American welfare state is smaller than before? And, granted that overall spending is larger, why was that program better than what we are spending money on now. Keep in mind that a growing population does not account for this growth in spending. We are looking at GDP percentages, NOT total real expenditures. In regards to the union problem, the wage difference is generally a low percentage. Something like 15% if I remember hearing on MSNBC That is less than enough to make up for difference in cost of living. As I found using this calculator, the difference between Boston and North Carolina is 20%: http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/ Also, fine, you made a good point with fringe benefits, but dont forget to subtract union dues as well. All told, the difference would be so small, that it would shave a few hairs off of the growing income gap if more workers were unionized. Again, my point was that it was a red herring. Something much bigger is going on, that being, a shift in the economy as a whole. Supply and demand in the labor market."
"You may get a different result, but you have not documented that result. Getting at the wage premium for union members is far more complex, you have to take into account fringe benefit such as health care coverage and pension, where the cost does not vary by region. Also, regional differences in cost of living for where union members actually live and work are not as high as the union wage premium in general, so right out of the box all you can show is that the wage premium shrinks, but it doesnt go away. Finally, citing Nate is weak -- youre missing the point that the growth in the welfare state that is above the population growth is driven by health care costs. Social security is a stable cost line item and funded as we go. If you really think the safety net is better now than in the past then you have not done much volunteer work lately."
"If I recall correctly the original plan was a single payer system, and congress rejected it. Which is why we got the affordable care act. "
"Youre not recalling correctly, no serious original plans (serious = passable) involved single payer. Originally democrats were fighting to get a public option system, but were reduced to settling for the individual mandate instead. When it comes to most of the ACAs criticisms, I think Anthony Weiner said it best very early on You know what would be unarguably constitutional? A public option"
"Actually, [its a little bit hairier than that](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/obamasdeal/view/)"
"Well, it seems doubtful that *the same Congress* is going to accept another Single Payer bill."
"&gt;If I recall correctly the original plan was a single payer system, and republicans said they wouldnt even consider healthcare reform unless it was about private health insurance, then inserted the mandate, then voted against what was left."
"Incorrect, the original plan was a public option, not single payer, and was never voted on."
If I recall correctly Obama agreed to get rid of the public option because he wanted Republicans to vote for the ACA. That worked out great for him.
There was also the public option.
"You recall incorrectly. Thats what the Democratic shills were pretending. The reality is that Americans overwhelmingly wanted a public option 75+%, or single payer at 50+%. The Democrats did not want either. Period. They were one vote away from a supermajority (filibuster-proof), but couldnt somehow find that one vote in a special election in Massachusetts of all places. Yet somehow theyve managed to ditch the filibuster now that it comes time to appoint cronies to the judiciary. Meanwhile, Obama went in the back room to suck in lobbyist money from big pharma and undercut the bill. And the shills took to the internet to try to walk back the Obama hopeful. Eventually they blamed some of it on Joe Lieberman, as if one single guy stood up against the entire nation on this. It was the DEMOCRATS who fucked health care reform, and they did it for money. The Republicans just sat on their fat asses and laughed the whole time. The end result was a bill with a small number of helpful reforms and a huge amount of corporate handouts."
"Looking back, Obama was always wishy-washy on single payer. I do remember there was a point where he went into closed-door negotiations with industry leaders. Thats when single payer went bye-bye and we ended up with this convoluted mess. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/16/barack-obama/obama-statements-single-payer-have-changed-bit/ [Google Search: obama closed door negotiations healthcare industry](https://www.google.com/search?q=obama+closed+door+negotiations+single+payer&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS541US541&amp;oq=obama+closed+door+negotiations+single+payer&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.12917j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=93&amp;espv=210&amp;q=obama+closed+door+negotiations+healthcare+industry&amp;safe=off) "

I really dont know anything about Ted nugent besides this post. But Speaking as a person who is former military . I just cant see any fault in the guy. I know that this is not a popular opinion but I was in boot camp when 9/11 went down and I know what it feels like when your in a situation and you know you may not make it through it alive. I dont want to die for a cause that Im not 100% sure its worth dying for and I cant blame him for what he did. 
"Ya know, I cant fault him for dodging the Viet-Nam war/police action, and he has the right to say whatever he like about whatever he wants to.. I still hold the right to ignore him and his opinions for the turd of a human being that he is."
This is a good look at the depths cowards will go to to avoid serving. Pretty funny and sad he doesnt have the dignity or sense to realize what a lowlife worthless POS he appears to the rest of us.
"Ah yes buttered poop, a true delicacy .."

Id be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and Id have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin killers youd ever seen in my platoon. But I just wasnt into it. I was too busy doin my own thing, you know? And i could be a millionare, i just dont want to... What a wanker!"

"Wow.. I tried to express my disgust, but words cannot describe.."
"Thumbs up to 1970s Ted Nugent. Advocating for pointless wars is always nasty (So fuck you to 2000s Ted Nugent), but dodging Vietnam was just good sense. No point in getting forcibly inducted into the military so you can be sent to fight and die for the ambition and pride of a couple wannabe Sun Tzus in the White House. No point in getting drafted because your peers are idiots and think signing up for the draft is some kind of grand masculinity contest. Id have shit my pants too."
In a 2006 [interview](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nugent#Military) with The Independent Nugent said that he made up all of the stuff he said to High Times. This is in his wikipedia page.
"Thank you, seltaeb4. You made my day, month, and year."
"&gt;But you know the funny thing about it? Id make an incredible army man. Id be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and Id have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin killers youd ever seen in my platoon. Just as long as I got to stay as far away as possible from the fighting and just gave out orders. Otherwise, fuck it. Id probably start pooping myself again. FTFY"
I was too busy doing my own thing? I wonder how many draftees also had their own thing to do but went anyway?
"Out of all the stupid bullshit he says in this thing, my favorite part is that he mentions being anti-drug in an interview with fucking High Times. This guy is such a clown, which must explain why hes laughing all the way to the bank."
I fucking love how he loses all sense of dignity in order to show that he doesnt believe in going off to die for no reason and that he will not play ball with their system. It takes a fucking lot of humility to swallow your pride and dignity to stand up for what you believe in and keep doing what you were meant to do.

"He got a Y-1: &gt;Registrant available for military service, but qualified only in case of war or national emergency.

"Ted Nugent, Hero Patriot. From *High Times* magazine, October 1977. High Times: How did you get out of the draft? Ted Nugent: Ted was a young boy, appearing to be a hippie but quite opposite in fact, working hard and playing hard, playing rock and roll like a deviant. People would question my sanity, I played so much. So I got my notice to be in the draft. Do you think I was gonna lay down my guitar and go play army? Give me a break! I was busy doin it to it. I had a career Jack. If I was walkin around, hippying down, getting loaded and pickin my ass like your common curs, Id say Hey yeah, go in the army. Beats the poop out of scuffin around in the gutters. But I wasnt a gutter dog. I was a hard workin, motherfuckin rock and roll musician. I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and Id drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up. See, I approached the whole thing like, Ted Nugent, cool hard-workin dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces. Im gonna play their own game, and Im gonna destroy em. Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss. I was ill. And three or four days before, I started stayin awake. I was close to death, but I was in control. I was extremely antidrug as Ive always been, but I snorted some crystal methedrine. Talk about one wounded motherfucker. A guy put up four lines, and it was for all four of us, but I didnt know and Im vacuuming that poop right up. I was a walking, talking hunk of human poop. I was six-foot-three of sin. So the guys took me down to the physical, and my nerves, my emotions were distraught. I was not a good person. I was wounded. But as painful and nauseous as it was -- cause I was really into bein clean and on the ball -- I made gutter swine hippies look like football players. I was deviano. So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldnt believe the smell. They were ridiculin me and pushin me around and I was cryin, but all the time I was laughin to myself. When they stuck the needle in my arm for the blood test I passed out, and when I came to they were kicking me into the wall. Then they made everybody take off their pants, and I did, and this sergeant says, Oh my God, put those back on! You fuckin swine you! Then they had a urine test and I couldnt piss, But my poop was just like ooze, man, so I poop in the cup and put it on the counter. I had poop on my hand and my arm. The guy almost puked. I was so proud. I knew I had these chumps beat. The last thing I remember was wakin up in the ear test booth and they were sweepin up. So I went home and cleaned up. They took a putty knife to me. I got the street rats out of my hair, ate some good steaks, beans, potatoes, cottage cheese, milk. A couple of days and I was ready to kick ass. And in the mail I got this big juicy 4-F. Theyd call dead people before theyd call my ass. But you know the funny thing about it? Id make an incredible army man. Id be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and Id have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin killers youd ever seen in my platoon. But I just wasnt into it. I was too busy doin my own thing, you know?

"Most commercial and residential electricity in the US is provided by coal power. Coal is the single largest man-made source of mercury emissions in the country. Modern CFLs are generally around five or six times more energy efficient than incandescent bulbs ? which means your incandescent bulb is responsible for pumping five or six times more mercury into the environment than your CFL bulb.

"Personally, the only reason I ever point someone towards politifact is when they are conservative leaning people, and its a means to say, Even this organization that tries so hard to call both sides equally bad in every instance, who bends over backwards to call dems just as bad so as to not seem biased, is pointing out a huge lie from xs mouth. You can verify this very quickly by looking at the things the call lies and such from both sides...the right wing ones are like demonstrable holy shit they pulled this out of their ass lies...and on the left.. its a lot of grey area, sort of a lie but with context not quite a lie, but we are going to call it a lie just the same. Also.. people/organizations can be right in one area and at the same time..wrong in another. Which for me personally, tends to make me not trust them, a broken clock is right twice a day.. But that doesnt mean go and set your damn watch to it. Wow...took so much thought to analyze the situation...But oh my, then you dont get the sweet call r/politics libtardos karma. "
jellicle did both of those things?
Yep. This is how this pathetic waste of server space runs. No credibility in this sub. Its a complete joke and 90% of the morons that frequent this cesspool have their heads so far up Elizabeth Warrens ass that they mix liberal fantasy land up with the real world. There is a reason this sub is no longer a default. 
"Ah, so we use politifact to our advantage when it makes a republican look bad but simply say youre wrong when it paints Obama as your typical politics? Sweet, sweet /r/politics. I think they took this place from the frontpage because of all the enlightenment."

"The problem with sites like these is if they call it like it is, people will say they are biased against republicans so in order to not be called a liberal media rag, they must make stupid choices like these."
"Seriously, there is a reason I unsubscribed from this subreddit. This is exactly it. The democratic circle jerking in this sub reddit is **terrible**.

"Hate to burst your bubble, but studies find that people tend to form their political affiliations and outlook while they are young, and stick to them for life. Which is why the GOP screwed themselves so badly by turning off a whole generation. I love the fact that the GOP spent the last 30 years plying the electorate with wedge issues, cultural tribalism and dog whistle racism, and now you are upset that its backfired on you - and the very things you tried to divide the electorate with: straight versus gay, whites versus blacks and Hispanics, tough men against sissy women, religion versus godless atheism, has come back to bite you. And you dont like that. Too bad. As for the economy, the GOP have no more of a plan to revive the economy than the democrats do. More fucking tax cuts for the rich? Lower wages and benefits? Work harder, for less money, so the rich can get richer? The young people arent buying it. And for the middle aged. The best economy we can remember were those good old Clinton days - and guess whos running for president in 16? As for Captain Obvious Southerlands observation that people with jobs has money...well, thats very clever of him. Id suggest that the numbers he should be interested are [the ones hes trailing by in the polls.](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/330301-dem-polling-shows-reps-kline-southerland-trailing-opponents)"

See Democrats have no recovery to offer. How people are so blind to this is sometimes amazing...but sometimes folks just buy into propaganda. Dont want someone to call you a homophobe, scientifically illterate racist? You better vote Democrat. We may go down the tubes as a nation, but at least well be politically correct about it. Amirite?

Biggest increase in any 4 year term in history. Adjusted for inflation. But somehow thats not on his legacy. 
He voted for the bailouts and could have vetoed them 3 months later when he became president. 
"[Probably because its not true.](http://factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2012/02/DebtReaganObama.png) See [here](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/02/dueling-debt-deceptions/). The largest accumulator of debt was Reagan by a rather large nose. If we adjust the ongoing costs of the wars to the President they started underneath, the cost of the bailouts, Id be willing to bet money that Obama is even further behind the debt pushing than Bush was. Maybe Ill get downvoted for this, but I get tired of the uneducated Republicans/Libertarians and the Independents wholl blame a President for ongoing costs not a result of his actions."
"From your link: &gt; he Congressional Budget Office now projects that it will grow to more than $16 trillion by the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30.[2012] At that point, the debt will have increased by more dollars in Obama?s first four years than it did in George W. Bush?s entire eight-year tenure, when it rose by $4.9 trillion. The rise under Obama would then be the biggest dollar increase for any president in U.S. history go on... "
Hm not sure how much faith I put in a blog that claims to fight the tyranny of feminism and then blames feminism for economic policy. Though the outcome of the stimulus plan is the outcome of course.
"&gt; Take that as you will. Looks like total garbage. &gt;I do think its pretty unquestionable though that the original stimulus plan was altered after meetings with lobbyists and it really was the case that a large proportion of the billions of dollars were indeed spent on things that werent roads, dams, or bridges. Indeed. A lot of it was spent on tax cuts for the rich, at the demand of GOP legislators, [about 28% of it based on PolitiFacts estimate](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/10/jon-stewart/stewart-claims-stimulus-bill-one-third-tax-cuts/). The idea that feminists rolled the President into making huge overhauls to the stimulus plan to benefit their agenda is pretty laughable, considering that he let the GOP run away with the particulars the very moment he could give up control."
"http://rebukingfeminism.blogspot.com/2009/09/no-country-for-burly-men-feminists.html Its from a website called rebuking feminism and the writer is a woman from the American Enterprise Institute.

I do think its pretty unquestionable though that the original stimulus plan was altered after meetings with lobbyists and it really was the case that a large proportion of the billions of dollars were indeed spent on things that werent roads, dams, or bridges. "
Are there any non-politcal reasons why states turned down the federal subsidy money? Are there strings attached?
The GOP claims to represent Christian values fairly often and loudly. Thats what it has to do with anything. Is that a surprise to you? Or were you being deliberately obtuse?
"Well, Obama did [promise a public option](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/518/create-public-option-health-plan-new-national-heal/) and I think the ACA was sold to the public with that in mind. It should have been ACA with the public option or no ACA imo. "
&gt;and far from Christian Huh? What does that have to do with anything?
"They eventually have to pay for 10% of the costs. Expansion even with that cost probably saves them money in the long term, but thats the only semi-reasonable argument I can recall at the moment."
"Thats a fair criticism of Obama, but its not the reason why the GOP opposes Medicaid expansion, so its basically a non-sequitur."
"And yet somehow, in the right wing bizarro world, the fuckups of state GOP politicians is totally Obamas fault. The fact that these fuckups are deliberate, nasty, expensive, hateful, and far from Christian are just piss icing on the shit cake."
"So, let me get this right. Someone mindlessly makes a comment without any source, and it gets upvoted, and taken as the gospel of god because it affirms your beliefs. But, when I make a comment that includes several sources, one being [a source thats constantly used on this sub](http://www.reddit.com/domain/politifact.com/) and the other being that of an organization that represents peoples rights, like the ACLU, its just considered horseshit, because youre views have been called out? Am I right about that? Or are you so close minded you refute blatant facts presented to you, just like those right wingers, whom you like to mock, that dont believe in climate change? "
"Being open minded does not mean that you have to fairly weigh the evidence on the same tired horseshit, talking points **every time** theyre presented. At about the 19th time, that shit gets old. You might be confusing open minded with stupid. Theyre two very different terms. Also, who do you link to thats like the ACLU? The Ohio Farm Bureau? The Texas Farm Bureau? You *do* realize those are fucking ag industry lobbying groups, right? BTW, you might want to go over to Wikipedia and edit out that long section in the Politifact entry labeled criticisms. If only to preserve your fantasy that Im the 1st person in history to criticize Politifact. "
"&gt;Politifact says its true. Actually the Politifact Ohio link you supply provides zero (0) examples of family farms or ranches being sold to pay estate taxes. The only evidence thats offered comes in the form of assurances that its true from politicians and lobbyists with obvious biases. Journalism in Ohio appears to be in the Stone Age. The only example you supply is from another lobbyist group and uses the politically loaded talking-point term death tax just a few sentences in. No real data is supplied: we just have to take the ranchers story at face value. So the right wingers still have a really hard time providing valid examples of all these thousands of middle class Americans supposedly losing their family ranches, farms and businesses. Maybe theyre just very good at hiding themselves from the rest of us, like all those millions who supposedly commit voting fraud. Then again maybe its just a bunch of horseshit. Im going with horseshit."
"but the Citizens United decision was in 2010.. Prior to Citizens United, there was an even HIGHER correlation between spending and winning. You might argue that Citizens United lessened that effect (From your link): &gt;In congressional races in 2010, the candidate who spent the most won 85 percent of the House races and 83 percent of the Senate races, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That?s a large percentage, but it?s lower than what the sign indicated. &gt;Indeed, the percentage for 2010 was lower than it had been in recent election cycles. The center found that in 2008, the biggest spenders won 93 percent of House races and 86 percent of Senate races. In 2006, the top spenders won 94 percent of House races and 73 percent of Senate races. And in 2004, 98 percent of House seats went to candidates who spent the most, as did 88 percent of Senate seats. &gt;So the protester?s sign would have been essentially correct had it not specifically cited 2010 -- though even then, it would only be true for the House and not for the Senate, which has consistently seen lower percentages of the bigger spenders win. &gt;Meanwhile, the success rate of big spenders has been lower at the state level. &gt;The most recent figures, from the 2008 election cycle, show that 80 percent of state legislative candidates with the monetary advantage won their contests. In 2006, it was 83 percent; in 2004, it was 84 percent; and in 2002, it was 82 percent. (The group?s figures for 2010 are due to be released in the next month or so.)"
You think Obama didnt receive any corporate money? 
"As the most popular political race, the presidential election is the least accurate meter of the effect of money in a given race. Smaller campaigns where emotion and participation are cooler provide a better sample. And in those elections, 85% of the time the win goes to the candidate who spends more. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/17/occupy-wall-street/occupy-wall-street-protesters-sign-says-94-percent"
Id venture to guess Obama received about equal amounts of contributions as Romney. 
sure he did. But I wouldnt say that is why he won
Obamas landslide in 2012 over Romney proved that fears of corporate money buying elections are overblown.
"This title would appear to be a tad sensationalist, since the food stamp program has not been nixed. Food Stamp benefits continue, and will be funded via an actual food stamp bill (as opposed to shoehorning it into the Farm Bill)."
"[Members of Congress Received $238K in Farm Subsidies](http://www.ewg.org/release/members-congress-received-238k-farm-subsidies) WASHINGTON --- Environmental Working Group?s 2013 update of its Farm Subsidy Database shows that 15 members of Congress or their spouses benefitted from a total of $237,921 in taxpayer-funded farm subsidy payments last year. EWG?s compilation of farm subsidies has been searched nearly 440 million times since 2004 and is widely credited for advancing efforts to reform farm subsidies. The farm subsidy database tracks $256 billion in farm income support through commodity, crop insurance, and disaster programs and $39 billion in conservation support paid to farmers and landowners from 1995 through 2012. However, EWG is prohibited by federal law from reporting crop insurance subsidies, which now comprise two-thirds of the farm safety net. EWG and the taxpayers footing the bill cannot know which farmers, including which members of Congress, receive subsidies to buy crop insurance, said Craig Cox, EWG?s Senior Vice President for Agriculture and Natural Resources. We do know that in 2011, 26 policyholders received more than $1 million apiece in crop insurance premium support in 2011, and that more than 10,000 policyholders received more than $100,000 each. U.S. Department of Agriculture has refused to provide us with the same information for 2012. "
"Food stamps werent cancelled. It was split off for the farm bill. Reading the headline and the comments, you would expect millions dead in the streets here in a couple weeks. Sensationalized bullshit."
"No, they took Food Stamps out of the Farm Bill so it wouldnt be tied to aid for farmers. They arent about destroying the program altogether, just making it a different bill. Honestly the two are completely different and shouldnt be included on the same bill. The Farm bill should be about farms, not food stamps."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-l-borosage/republicans-nix-food-stam_b_3585831.html Republicans Nix Food Stamps: This Is Who They Are 
"The less publicized details on this bill? Whatever savings they gained by cutting all food stamps, they spent that on ridiculous pork and additional, unwarranted subsides. They cant even claim being financially conservative on this one, its absolutely ludicrous. They literally dont seem to give a shit how terrible they look any more. "
so all they did was separate food stamps from a farm bill? 
Its crazy that the Christian party is against **feeding poor people.** I cant even wrap my head around the inconsistency there. 
This must be why homeland security bought all those shiny new machine guns and hallow points that match their all new urban armored vehicles they just purchased. And why FEMA needs thousands of coffins stockpiled all over the country. Things that make you go hummm
"I do believe we should restrict what you can buy with food stamps. People should only be able to buy main meal items. No cookies, cakes, pastries, candy, soda, and other inessential food items. People would argue that people need freedoms in what they buy or that they dont know good food to cook. I say, force the issue, and if you want freedom in what food you get... If you are not greatfull with free government food, then get off the system!"
"They say they want to break the cycle of poverty and dependency. You know what would really perpetuate that cycle? Malnourishment of school age children. If you dont feed a kid, you end up with a dumb adult that cant hold a decent job. "
The government is about to start WW3 and were bitching about food stamps and the NSA. GG America.
"Its not really NIXED per-say. The whole story is... Farm Bill was composed of multiple parts. Two significant parts were: * support agriculture * provide supplemental nutrition (food stamps) The 2nd part was controversial, because **it was costly.** And people were using food stamps **to buy non-foods.** For some odd reason, this bill was renewed every 5 years. This time around, when renewing was needed, there were 2 versions of farm bills. * House - Cut $40 bil from the SNAP (Food Stamps). * Senate - Cut $5 bil from the SNAP (Food Stamps). Of course Democrats hated this idea of cutting from Food Stamps, and Farm bill in House **did not pass,** because Democrats thought it *cut way too much.* People got mad, and they decided to try again. Republicans decided to separate SNAP from the Agricultural benefits, and pass it through the house. This was mostly because they could not get an agreement within their party on what the terms of SNAP is. How much to cut, how to prevent fraud, etc... And, they *promised* to work on SNAP later, which Democrats dont buy. This also kills any leverage for Democrats, because once they introduce their version of SNAP, it will be **This or Nothing.** If they pass this in Senate, which will most likely not happen, unless they pass the separate SNAP bill before Senate takes up on it, the situation is like below: We currently have allocated budget for Food Stamps from the previous budget. (which will most likely be used for it) But we do not have the statement in the farm bill, that says we need to give money to Food Stamps. tl;dr: So its not Nixed yet, but it **COULD BE** Nixed"
They are what we thought they were! (Dennis Green voice)
Step 1: Cut food stamps while there are 4 unemployed people for every job opening. Step 2: ???? Step 3: Everyone has a job and can buy their own food. 
ITT: People who get their information from headlines
"No thanks assholes, I like to eat."
I think they divided the farm bill into two separate pieces of legislation because they could not pass a combo bill that would address agricultural policy and SNAP/food stamps. Right? 
"They didnt cut it they split the bill into two parts so they could pass one and argue about the SNAP program some more. Likely it will eventually pass, its not like now food stamps will disappear overnight. "
Dont be an idiot. They separated it from the farm bill.
"The whole point of separation is not to fund it, under fund it, or hold it as hostage for something else. Pointless really , no food stamps = no farm bill . Midwest Republicans can take that back home and smoke it."
"I hate both major parties, GOP however is the bigger piece of shit. How is it that they ride such a mighty high horse of christian values and morals, gross hypocrites. For those callous christian GOP pigs that support this go read 1 John 3:17 cant get any clearer. Practice what you preach. "
"Shouldnt have let scumbags like Bill Clinton starve 500,000 Iraqi children to death, merikuns. Now starve a little yourselves. Karma is a bitch."
"Lets just give the 99% food stamps, welfare, free cell phones, subsidized housing, and unemployment for life. We have to help because they are poor! Think of the kids! "
"Fundies that only care about having a white president and stopping abortion need to be silenced. Are there ANY christians who care about social issues and stopping war? This has been *only* the worst financial downturn the world has seen since the depression, yet they seem to find funding for yet more war without a fucking peep from the right every time. Not once have I heard of ANY christians standing up about these issues **except** the Nuns on the bus. The only real christians Ive heard of. Any others? Seems to me fundies only care about taking womens reproductive rights away these days, and really dont care if children just down the road go to bed hungry."
How many more sharks does The GOP have to jump until people get that this Party has thrown off all pretense and is basically The Party of Evil now?
Such good and loving CHRISTIANS. Fake religious people make me ill. Hypocrites at every turn.
"whats nice for some of these Republicans, is that they PERSONALLY receive farm subsidies from us. and they got to vote yesterday to keep taking our money! Rep Steve Fincher (R) of Tenn, got nearly $3.5M in federal farm subsidies between 1999 and 2012. but says cuts MUST be made to food stamps because, We have to remember there is not a big printing press in Washington that continually prints money over and over. Rep Doug LaMalfa, (R) of CA took nearly $5.13M since 1995. and he also thinks American kids should go hungry. Rep Marlin Stutzman (R) of Indiana has received nearly $200,00 in subsidies, and wants to cut $30B from food stamps in the next 10 yrs. and, of course, Michele Bachmann has been lining her pockets for years, courtesy of the federal government she says she ha tes.

"We shouldnt drug test people on aid! Its a violation of their rights! Even though, in order for me and you to get a job (which funds their aid) we must take a drug test! These people DESERVE unemployment! Why should they have to work! Raise the taxes, everyone should get equal everything! Also, the Huffington Post is incredibly trustworthy and completely unbiased! Believe everything you read on there because 128.5% of the time its right according to the same poll that Obama used saying 90% of Americans support gun control!"
"Not that I disagree with the article. Republicans are so wrong in this issue but I fucking hate bullshit like, despite over a third of welfare recipients being white... Because there are more white people in America. If you look at overall percentages more of the minority population are on food stamps than white people. I just dont like how they try to slant it like,more white people use food stamps! Yeah well, more white people also arent on food stamps because theres more white people in general. Its just written in a shitty way. I hate it. "
"People that need food stamps are not always lazy...they more likely are less capable than others...or by some misfortune have fallen in need...that is what government and society is there for....help people have a better life. No, this has nothing to do with socialism...it has to do with humanity. One more thing...for a family of 4, working minimum wage at most cities, it is hard to cover expenses and raising a family and this assistance is crucial to the welfare of that family. Oh, another thing....GOP, why is it OK to bail out those from Wall Street...and not the ordinary people....you know....those kind as you refer to them."
"Obviously they arent saying to get rid of Food stamps, they are just separating the bills. About three quarters of the money going to the Farm Bill went to food stamps. The Farm bill should be for Farms, and a Food Stamp bill should be for food stamps."
"I need a clear, solid answer on this: How does this affect people who are on food stamps or will be applying for the program within the next few months, the next year, and the next few years? I am about to apply for the program because otherwise I wont be able to afford food at all. Any amount of food. Other members of my family are currently under the program (my sister, under 18, and several seniors in my family, but also people who are in their 30s) and they also are concerned. But I read this article and it doesnt actually explain what this means for us. Will they lose their welfare? Should I even try to apply? Will I be accepted if my circumstances qualify, or will I be rejected outright because the program wont be funded? How much should we expect to get out of them compared to the last few years? I dont care about party politics, that is all bullshit. Democrat or Republican, they both have their ways of screwing us over. But how do their bills and the decisions they make affect us in our lives? Will I be able to afford one meal a day come next year? Or will I have to resort to digging through trash cans behind the local McDonalds to get my dinner?"

You cant deny that food stamps are being abused.
"Hey, I work my ass off every day, yet I am still broke. I like sandwiches. Will somebody buy me a sandwich? "
"I think they only nixed the food stamps from the farm bill, right? As far as I know the program is still funded and functional."
"A major reason online poker is illegal is because a politician (yes, a republican) attached wording making it illegal to the end of a bill called the Port Security Act. People couldnt vote against it because they would look like they were supporting terrorists. Having unrelated legislation tied together helps the government restrict our rights and obscure their actual goals. While I do not think the Texans did this for that reason, I will applaud it if it results in separate bills for farms and food stamps. Also I totally favor ending subsidies for farms."
Misleading title. They separated the bills and will vote on them independently. 
Yes that is who they are. They arent denying that. No surprises here on either side.
The Food Assistance programs (which included more than food stamps) were welfare for the poor. The Farm Subsidy the Republicans passed is welfare for the Rich. Republicans tell you the story of welfare queens buying prime cuts of beef and crab. Well what about people like Bon Jovi a popstar or Michelle Bachmann a congresswoman who stand to make a bunch of money at your expense. That bottle of crystal Bon Jovi opens and then pours out is paid for by the American taxpayer. 
We pay farmers so they wont grow food (and keep food prices artificially high) while people go hungry. Im sure conservatives would tell you how proud the Founding Fathers would be.
"Doesnt matter...half of the the fucking people who *need* them will be dumb enough to support this and the assholes who did it in. And redditors have already voted it down 43 times...I rest my case. Americans are too stupid to deserve much more than the bear minimum, honestly. They will tear off their noses to spite their faces."
"Im upset that the bill passed at all. There shouldnt be any subsidies to agribusiness, nor any food stamp programs. It should be up to charities to feed the indigent and to businesses to worry about their solvency."
"Im struggling to be outraged but honestly I just cant bring myself to give a shit. Its not like its a big secret that they dont like food stamps and they have been trying to kill it off because they think minorities are leeches and criminals bleeding the system. Itll suck that people will go hungry but this is what the republicans voted for and itll be fun to watch all those poor, hungry poor people wondering why they dont have food."
"Food stamps are a dumb policy and Americans are Orwellian, brainwashed anti-poor numptys "
"OMG! OMG! NO MORE BIG GULPS AND GIANT SIZE SKITTLES FOR MY FAMILY!!!11 More leftists propaganda (Dont look at us shredding the Constitution, look at those evil Republicans trying to kill poor black kids) LOL dont worry everyone, food stamps are just fine."
What part of were broke dont you left-wing morons understand?
Food stamps cut. George Zimmerman acquitted. This is shaping up to be a perfect chimpout storm. Be prepared this could be a category 5 chimpout. 
"Food stamps are a left-wing invention to sustain blacks that are too lazy to sustain themselves. Now *real* Americans are working hard to sustain the very ones who are raping their women and killing their children! Blacks - **15 IQ points lower** than Whites Blacks - **4x more likely** than Whites to be **on welfare** Blacks - According to the Bureau of Justice, **1 out of 3 will be in jail** Blacks - Incarceration rate **6x that of whites** Blacks - **55% of homicides despite 15%** of the population And you wonder why we want to stop letting these people mooch off of us! The bleeding heart liberals would have us give the money we earn for our families and give it to the same fuckers that are driving us extinct!"
And I agree with your comment. 
are you aware that our national debt is declining faster than in the last 40 years? *this is wrong dont upvote. It should say the deficit is declining. 
"So he solution is just to add ACA to the credit card? When do you stop and say, hey we need to lower the debt, we need to spend less. "
"If healthcare is where you draw your line in the sand in regard to spending, your priorities are really bizarre."

"[The ACA lowers the deficit](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obamacare-adds-trillions-deficit/), which in turn lowers the debt."
you stop when a majority of people agree with you and elect representatives in enough number to pass the laws you wish. This should be obvious to you.
"Nope. The ACA is projected to decrease the deficit, and repealing it would have the [opposite effect.](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/healthcare/299895-cbo-obamacare-repeal-will-increase-the-deficit)"
Nice to see an old Romney talking point regurgitated here. What you are implying is simply [false.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obamacare-adds-trillions-deficit/)

Obama hasnt really kept any promises...so theres that too. 
"This is a half true statement yes technically the debt went up under him but that was due to programs that were approved under Bush such as the Bush tax cuts (which cost the government $3 trillion), the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which it tallies at $1.4 trillion) and the Medicare prescription drug program ($300 billion). Remember the Iraq and Afghanistan were never put on the books during the Bush administration and once Obama took office they were then accounted for. Another factor for this is inflation. Heres an excerpt from an article that fact checked the claim you are making. The claim that ?Obama?s four deficits are the four largest in U.S. history? ignores the fact that Obama inherited most of his first deficit when he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009. As we have written?many times?before, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Officeprojected?the fiscal year 2009 deficit at $1.2 trillion two weeks?before?Obama took office. That fiscal year started Oct. 1, 2008. Due to some additional spending under Obama, the deficit increased to?$1.4 trillion?for fiscal year 2009. At the end of the fiscal year, the CBO largely?blamedthe 2009 deficit on the recession, specifically a sharp decline in tax revenues and an increase in spending in response to the economic crisis ? first by Bush and later by Obama. Obama is ?adding almost as much debt as all 43 previous presidents combined.? We?first looked into?a similar claim back in February when it was included in a partisan graphic circulating via email and Facebook. It was wrong then, and remains so today. This claim is easily checked by plugging Obama?s inauguration date ? Jan. 20, 2009 ? into the Treasury Department?s handy ?debt to the penny? calculator. It shows that the nation?s total debt stood at $10.6 trillion on the day Obama took office, and it was at $16.2 trillion on Oct. 8. That means total debt has increased $5.6 trillion so far under Obama. That?s a huge increase in the national debt ? more than 50 percent. But $5.6 trillion is nowhere near ?almost as much? as the $10.6 trillion in debt amassed under the first 43 presidents. http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/the-facts-according-to-obama-and-romney-ads/ "
"So in other words, hes following Reagans lead. Reagan was the one who proved to conservatives that deficits dont matter"
The lies people tell. Obama has ran up more debt in five years than all previous presidents combined.
Really? He himself spent every dollar? When Congress has the power of the purse? 
What if the Morpheus glasses told you both more nominal debt and greater fiscal restraint were possible at the same time?
Its a shame that you refuse to acknowledge when youre mistaken. Thats a sad way to live life.

The inability of this administration to clearly and concisely communicate vital information is truly astonishing.
That doesnt matter man. Have you seen how *cool* our president is? Man he is like the coolest guy ever. Man. So cool. 
The Fox fan club does. It is inconvenient to their position.
"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/benghazi-timeline/ &gt; There were no protesters at the Benghazi consulate prior to the attack, even though Obama and others repeatedly said the attackers joined an angry mob that had formed in opposition to the anti-Muslim film that had triggered protests in Egypt and elsewhere. The State Department disclosed this fact Oct. 9 ? nearly a month after the attack. So Obama said that there was a protesting mob, and there was not a protesting mob. In fact, the Libyan president called it a terrorist attack on Sept 16 and was rebuked by the administration."
"and, this does what to dissuade that it was an attack over a film. Which is my point. How were they to know it was just a mindless terror attack, where the goal was not retribution for the film? You see, the Benghazi attack did not happen in a vacuum. There was multiple protests all over the region, called by Hezbollah. In fact, they were happening all over the world(Pak, AFG, IND, LEB, SYR, YMN, IRQ, etc.. The attack being over a video, is entirely possible given these contexts."
Does everyone forget there was protests at almost every embassy in the region?
"i didnt say all sports, but some of those do have a violent element. golf: whacking a ball with a club ~~(funfact: golf is an acronym that stands for gentlemen only, ladies forbidden. i say the act of cutting a population into groups is an act of violence)~~. baseball: see golf. soccer: ive lost teeth, broken bones and had several fights waged against me without ever trying to escalate a struggle to violence (mostly school sponsored). gymnastics isnt all that violent i guess. track and field actually has an event where you compete with who can throw a javelin the best."
is there an echo in here?
http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/golf.asp
I think youre equating physical exertion and impact with violence. I feel like that youre misconstruing either sports or violence.
"Thats not the origin of the word golf. Dont spread myths. The name was originally from the Dutch word for club, kolf, and then taken to Scottish where it became goulf and eventually turned into golf. Edit: corrected phone typo weird -&gt; word"
my whole world is a lie
"Violence is the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation."
"Actually, I believe the correct term is they came out of the right penis.. No one chooses their parents you silly goose."
"The Waltons, whose six children control a combined $156 BILLION in wealthy simply because they chose their parents well prior to being born."
"The so what is when Sam Walton made the fortune, the kids (who did nothing to deserve their billions other than be born to the right family) inherit the fortune, and then their kids inherit it, then their kids, and so on and so on. Its called an aristocracy, where generations of individuals are granted power and wealth not because of their achievements but because of their family name. The US was specifically founded in rejection of an Aristocratic regime. This is the source of the Estate Tax, which began in 1797, to prevent a permanent Aristocracy from ever forming in the United States. Will rich parents always be able to pass along enorumous wealth to their kids? Yes. But the American system was specifically designed to prevent a small number of families controlling vast wealth for generations simply due to an accident of birth. Each generation must prove itself by proving their worth and contributing something back to society not because you happened to be born with the right surname."
Youll also see 0/6 of them on the list of most charitable billionaires. My girlfriend briefly met one of them at some bullshit thing for the university and she said he (I dont remember which one) reeked of arrogance. Its an awful family that engages in awful business practices. But I love their low low prices.
"this is an unpopular opinion puffin comment but i think that anyone who is against inheritance has never had to deal with inheritance issues themselves. My grandparents worked hard and bought property in nyc. My parents and uncle now use it to help them in retirement. When they pass it will go to us. We sat down and went over the options, if left alone with no trust the government would tax us so badly we would have to sell the property just to pay. I understand nobody cares about the same handful of families that everyone on reddit loves to mention every day...but this idea you guys have would affect hard working people too. I have seen people lose buildings due to the inheritance tax, its sad to see that. If youre on the end that takes then sure it sounds like a great idea."
"This stat is the monster stat: The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined. http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/08/one-wisconsin-now/just-how-wealthy-wal-mart-walton-family/"
"So, they dont deserve it? I mean, theyre dad created walmart. He didnt get the money illegally. Why should we take it from him?"
"No one is taking it from Sam Walton. But what did his kids do to earn the wealth? What did his grand kids do? His great grand kids? Without laws like the Estate Tax, one of the earliest taxes ever levied in the United States, 5,10, 20 generations from now the Walton family would still be billionaires. Not because they did anything to earn the money but simply because of their name. That would be an Aristocracy and that would be something the United States was founded specifically to reject. Each generation must prove its worth. Each generation must educate themselves, work hard, and contribute something back to to society. Supply Side economics (which argues that if we just make the wealthy slightly wealthier and record profitable companies slightly more profitable that money will trickle down to the rest of us somehow) and abandoning things like the Estate Tax (both current GOP policies) would undo the mechanism in place to that chips away at family estates and puts that money and assets back in the hands of the rest of society so that the individuals in the next generation have opportunities. Otherwise the money and assets are all controlled by a handful of families and the rest of us just live in service to them, not for 1-3 generations but for 10-30."
"Am I the only one that sees this and asks, so what? If I make tomorrows iPhone, for instance, I damn sure would like to leave my assets to any immediate family. No ones worse off because Im a family man. Some great entrepreneurs (Rockefeller, Vanderbilt maybe?) lived almost ascetic lives to leave their fortunes to their kids."
I need to marry a Walton 
"I am against inheritance for the same reason the founders where. Each generation should prove itself and contribute back to society. Why should you continue to benefit from the Achievements from your Grandparents. The fact that the grandkids or great grand kids lost the income units purchased by their family generations beforehand is ultimately a good thing for society. You should have to go out, get educated and contribute back to society. The idea of Land or other assets being passed for generations within a single family is called an Aristocracy and is exactly what the US was founded in rejection of."
You say that like its their fault?
"Its not their fault, but it wasnt their hard work that earned the fortune either. The US was founded in rejection of a British style aristocracy. Without policies like the Estate Tax a small number of families would control enormous wealth and power for not one or two generations but for 10, 15, 20, generations over hundreds of years. Without any of those generations ever truly working for their wealth, contributing new ideas, generating new wealth, and increasingly cut off from the issue and concerns of the every day citizen while controlling enormous wealth and the political power that comes with it. These are the types of conditions that lead to strict class systems (where despite your intelligence, hard work, other achievements you are trapped in poverty, because the system is designed to keep the poor poor and the rich rich), revolutions (including our own in the US), civil war, bloodshed, along with the basic moral questions of why 5 generations later should the descendents of Sam Walton be living in opulent wealthy and millions of others are condemned to a life of poverty without any hope of escape. "
"That actually is a problem. Education is becoming increasingly one sided, Hell after I got out of highschool i found out that about 70% of what I had learned History, and philosophically wise was completely incorrect. Public Education needs to be Re-structured so that they dont point you toward one party or another. They should give you the information you need to make your OWN opinion. and quit with the damn lies.... I love public Education, but the lopsidedness of it has fucked it up. also fuck zero tolerance.

"Its the same reason Republicans spend so much time trying to dismantle public education and divert funds to private schools using vouchers. Teachers unions tend to support Democratic candidates so they, and the public education system, must be eliminated. If the perception of Police and Fire departments wasnt that they tend to vote Republican you would see a lot less support for the militarization of the police."

"And thats exactly whats wrong with hyperbole like this. First, you make a laundry list of claims, and smirk off... and expect me to spend the next 2 hours looking up sources and proving you wrong. Im not doing it. Im not playing the game. All hes done... Really? Thats all hes done, huh?

Because I have things to do. &gt;**...increase the scope of the patriot act** &amp;nbsp; When the PATRIOT ACT came up for renewal for 1 year, there was a reform amendment offered. (This was just last year BTW) Congress shut down the reform attempts, and because they are basically too big of cowards to deal with it - they upped the Act to a 4 YEAR RENEWAL --- with ZERO REFORM. The Obama Administration stepped in and did what congress was to weak and cowardly to do themselves - enact some reforms in the Patriot Act. &amp;nbsp; [POLITIFACT](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/179/revise-the-patriot-act-to-increase-oversight-on-go/) &gt;This year-long extension (of the Patriot Act)came up for renewal again in early 2011. In this years re-authorization battle, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., sponsored an amendment that would have increased congressional oversight of these renewed provisions. Yet the Leahy-Paul Amendment was never brought to a full vote. Ultimately the Patriot Act was reauthorized *for four years instead* without any sort of additional oversight included in the final language. &gt;The extension of the Patriot Act provisions does not include a single improvement or reform, and includes not even a word that recognises the importance of protecting the civil liberties and constitutional privacy rights of Americans,? said Sen. Leahy. &gt;But the ACLUs Richardson noted that while there have been no additional legislative oversight measures passed during Obamas presidency, **there have been some put in place in the executive branch.** Most notably, the Justice Department decided to implement several measures that were originally included in the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act of 2009 - a failed oversight bill proposed by Sen. Leahy. In response to a letter from Leahy in December 2010, the Justice Department said it had: ? Implemented a requirement that, when library or bookseller records are sought via a Section 215 order for business records, a statement of specific and articulable facts showing relevance to an authorized investigation must be produced; ? Adopted a policy requiring the FBI to retain a statement of facts showing that the information sought through a National Security Letter (NSL) is relevant to an authorized investigation, to facilitate better auditing and accountability; ? Adopted procedures to provide notification to recipients of NSLs of their opportunity to contest any nondisclosure requirement attached to the NSL; ? Agreed to ensure that NSL recipients who challenge nondisclosure orders are notified by the FBI when compliance with such nondisclosure orders are no longer required; ? Adopted procedures for the collection, use and storage of information derived from National Security Letters, which were approved by Attorney General Holder on October 1, 2010. &amp;nbsp; The way I see this, its Obama 1 / congress 0. Im not absolving Obama, or saying he is great. But I get a little tired of the unsubstantiated bashing. Theres plenty of blame to go around."

"Granted, but the president cant just snap his fingers and overturn a law. He CAN snap his fingers and commute/pardon a sentence; and doing that can bring light on issues like this and lead to changes in legislation. TL;DR its a step in the right direction, take what you can get."
"the head of the executive branch? yeah, im pretty sure he has the ability to do more than commute a few sentences. its not magic. its the way our country is structured. he doesnt write the law, but he directs how those laws are [enforced](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/obamas-war-on-pot-20120216). "
"The president can only pardon people convicted under federal law. The vast majority of non-violent drug offenders are prosecuted under state law. Even if the president pardoned all the non-violent drug offenders convicted under federal law, it wouldnt put a dent in the problem. State law enforcement dwarfs federal law enforcement in the number of officers, courts, convictions, etc."

The US Sentencing Commission is also releasing the results of their review of prison terms next month.
"while leaving the policies that led to the conviction in place. good for those getting their sentences commuted; utterly meaningless for the millions who have been, or will be shafted by the failing drug war."
By what process do you propose the executive branch change legislation? That is traditionally the job of the legislature...
"You know the president doesnt actually make laws at all, right? This is like 6th grade civics."
"Turning the tide of these laws, that are the result of a national mindset since the 70ies - just say no, zero tolerance, 3 strikes, tough on crime, throw em under the jail - will take time and legislative will power to undo. We are just at the beginning of this tide turning and each little action, like this commutation, is tipping in reforms favor."
Change has to begin somewhere. You think Obama has a magic wand that will instantly reverse 40 years of anti-drug policy?
"Ha, demonize the poor as a drain on taxpayer funds while passing their tax breaks on to the backs of the middle class. Nice racket."
"What are you smoking? Please stop pretending that the middle class is paying taxes to subsidize a lack of taxes paid by the rich. Thats literally completely the opposite of what is happening. Edit: Just to be clear, this is factual stuff. Its really not up for dispute. http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43373 Im sorry it doesnt align with your political views, but its the truth.

In fact, theyre shouldering a disproportionately *low* amount of federal taxes. Once again, Im sorry that this doesnt fit your narrative, but its the truth."
"Find one thing he did promise that he came through on. I defy you. Didnt get socialized medicine. Didnt get an end to the war on the bad. Gitmo still open.

He expanded drone warfare and domestic spying. His DoJ let Wall Street run amok. Still have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he allowed gay folks to fight and die for the bullshit so I guess he has that going for him. All his administration has done differently is he can give a better speech than Bush. Same bullshit, just different faces. Now, please, partisan hacks, hit me with how it is all the Gang of Plutocrats fault."

I dont want the government telling me how much I can make. 
"I like your idea, but heres an alternative (that could probably coexist w/ yours): What if there were a rule that said something like Your highest-paid employee can only make 20x (or whatever) your lowest paid, (probably) including equity. It would also probably result in fewer, but higher-paying more productive jobs, while hopefully reigning in executive salaries. Theres a statistic floating around that US execs make like 500x their lowest employees salary, while in other countries (like Japan?) its only 70x. Anyone here know that stat? Ive fo sho seen it on reddit. "
"&gt;It would also probably result in fewer, but higher-paying more productive jobs, while hopefully reigning in executive salaries.

Yeah but who has heard of carternomics? At least Reagan has a legacy of starting the ball rolling of destroying the middle class. What has Jimmy Carter ever done to ruin millions of peoples lives?
Jimmy Carter was better than a lot of people at at the presidency. The american populace is too dumb to actually read up on some of the things he did. Corporate america hated him which is why you still hear about him being demonized to this day. The guy looked out for the american people. Thats what made him the worst president of the USA in the ignorant persons eyes.

He was.
"Reagan established the economic foundations for all the neocon bullshit of the second Bush Administration and the current congress. He championed deregulation and allowed businesses to get away with the bullshit that helped lead them into the position of power they have over our government now. His small business solution was to expand Government where peoples rights were at stake and contract it where it had the chance to help people keep their money. He ruined the tax system, ruined welfare, did all sorts of spooky shit with the dark state and ramped up the cold war until Russia busted instead of spending that money on something useful. I mean, for Gods sake, the American punk movement developed *under Reagan.* Thats not a good sign. If youre responsible for impoverished, angry street punks roaming your cities...really not a good sign. Rand Paul should have stuck to his guns- I would have loved to hear from a conservative, especially one championing the fun new trendy politicial ideology of libertarianism actually stand against the original neo-con."
Does anyone *really* find it all that surprising that one of the Republican frontrunners for President should try to appeal to the Democrats as being moderate after the Republicans got stomped in the last two presidential elections? 
"Well, Ronald Reagan *was* terrible on the budget. Despite cutting social services, he found new ways to spend money, including the largest peacetime military build ups, and guess what, his own brand of social outreach which which cost more than the services he cut and did less. But people loved him, its what happens when you elect and actor as president."
"Serious question: How did the myth start that Reagan was good at keeping a budget? Ive won a lot of arguments with confused people that think Reagan reduced our debt, when the quickest of searches show he was one of the biggest charge-and-spend presidents in history. "

"As someone who has Rand as a senator and hates him for holding us back, Im glad to see he has said this, and this makes me like him a bit more. That being said, this wont go over well. In Kentucky many many many many people think Reagan is the practically a God."
"OF course. Reagan spent his entire presidency destroying the American middle class, which is still going on by the GOP, if youve noticed."

"Mother Jones doing a hatchet job on behalf of the Neocon GOP Establishment? It is at moments like these that I am proud not to be a member of the Left (and I dont mean liberal. I mean real Left, like Anarchist or Communist). What a useless pack of addled insane douchebags. Is it any wonder so many RWers think Leftists are cats paws of international bankers?"
Maybe so but Regan had a way with words that moved a nation. Probably the most powerful speaker weve had.
Reagan was only a good president if you were already wealthy when he was in office.
"He probably was. Reagan talked a good budget game, but when it came to actually applying it, he was shit. Something about unnecessarily spending the Soviet Union into oblivion."
"Rand Paul is an idiot for not know Congress makes the budget, not the President. Derp. "
"Jimmy Carter was one of the best US presidents of recent history - not to mention what he has done after his presidency, which is exceptional and really shows where his heart is. He walks his talk."
ITT: People not realizing this video is 6 years old.
Yeah no shit. Reagan had the 3rd worst deficit out of all the presidents.
"The GOP base is freaking right now between Jeb Bush talking amnesty and Rand Paul firing a shot at the Gippers fiscal shortcomings. There will come a point where the the party will pull back to center a little bit and stop eating itself, until then they will crucify anyone in their ranks that breaks from the very narrow line of ideals they have carved out for themselves until the realization that being narrow in a diverse world doesnt win you elections outside of demographics with very narrow ideals, which are becoming fewer with every decade that passes."
I just woke up and I thought this said that Paul Rudd said that Jim Carrey was better on the budget than Ronald Reagan. Very confusing.
Isnt that obvious? Carter was so under-rated. 
"Ronald Reagan caused one of the worst budget problems in U.S. history by cutting taxes (reducing income) and massively increasing spending. Burning the candle at both ends. No fucking shit Carter did better than him. Anyone could have, just dont be an idiot with money. "
jimmah was also the one who started the whole de-regulation craze when he deregulated the airlines
Looks like Rand Paul is desperate for some attention.
Ever president was better on the economy then Reagon...
"What really fucks me up is being accused of isolationism...like its a bad thing. I mean, sure global trade should be kept but meddling in everybody elses shit and potentially reducing our (expensive) military presence abroad? I have zero problems with that."
"Random Paul. Just says any old thing. Doesnt have to make sense, or be consistent with anything else. The only common thread here is shameless attention whoring."
Rand Paul: right twice a day.
"You know, as a conservative (and someone who likes Reagan) I agree with him. I would like to point out, because, surprise surprise, Mother Jones doesnt; the congress was led by Dems for all of the Reagan years and about 30 years prior. Congress controls the purse strings, and Reagan cut a deal with the dems at the time to improve military spending because of the Soviets and consolidate the tax rates. To get that to happen, there was a great deal of pork and social spending put up in trade. For as much deficit as there was in those budgets, however, we bounced back and hit a period of economic growth that allowed the US to be in a place in the early 90s where we could reasonably balance the budget. You would not have had that without the growth in the 80s and early 90s. People remember the tech boom of the mid-90s, but it was not the reason we were able to balance the budget. Then we had Bush and republicans come in during the 00s and run up a ridiculous debt to prove how compassionate conservatives could be."
Careful Rand Paul! Traitorous talk about the venerated hero Regan will likely get you primaried.
Carter was better than Reagan on everything except he was unwilling to trade the freedom of American hostages for an election. The Reagan administration is possibly the worst presidency in American history but the revisionist history does not cover it in an honest light. 
"Every once in a while Rand says something clever. I just wish hed stop saying so much dumb stuff along side his gems. If you look back 30-40yrs, youll notice that in terms of spending, the GOP faaaaaaaar exceeds the democrats...which is of course ironic given they claim to be fiscally responsible. "
Ronald Reagan said he would bolster Defense over balancing the budget every single time. last weeks episode of The Americans showed a clip from the speech where he made that claim.
ITT: People who didnt read the article
No shit.
There goes the republican nomination...
"Almost every time I go out drinking with my buddy and his Dad, I get into an argument with his Dad over Jimmy Carter. The sole reason he dislikes Jimmy Carter is his handling of the Iranian hostage crisis. In his eyes, this makes him the worst president of all time."
And this is news? Reagan destroyed the budget by slashing taxes and increasing defense spending. This isnt even controversial. It is a basic fact. 
"if you define better as more fiscally responsible, then obviously.. Reagan and Bush II were the worst of all time."
So how is this news? I remember vaguely my high school history teacher saying that he send 3 times more than the previous president. 
Ouch. That was the sound of his chances of winning the GOP nomination going from minimal to zero.
"Well, there goes Rand Paul. You have affronted the GOPs Man-God Ronnie the First. You, sir, are toast."
There goes his chances in 2016. Thou shalt not speak ill of the Reagan (holy be His name) in the GOP. 
Jimmy Carter was a much better president than Reagan.
"The economy was a damned disaster-piece under Carter. Wait in line to get $5 worth of gas, so you can go wait in line to get $5 more gas. Interest rates up the wazoo. Everyone likes to say, But homes were only $40 grand. - they forget at 20% interest for 30 years. Prices for everything were going up and up, while paychecks stayed the same. You wanted to spend your paycheck to get prices before they went up, but all you could afford were eggs, milk, and cheese. But the hostages, the hostages. Reagan wasnt even president and rescued the hostages. Carters one brutal term is what you get when you get a micromanager, who thinks they know everything about everything as president. This is exactly why these to morons named Paul scare me with talk of gold standard and other such bullshit that was popular 100 years ago. The truth is, the only reason the Pauls like it, is because they can understand it. Its like trying to bring back the carburetor because I cant understand whats happening under the hood. "
"A Republican giving a Democrat praise? THIS IS IT, GUYS. THE RAPTURE IS COMING"
This is simply true because Carter didnt run up a huge debt like Reagan did.
**AND THERE IS ALREADY AN UPDATE TO THE ARTICLE WHERE HE IS BACKTRACKING ON HIS COMMENTS.** *facepalm*
"&gt; UPDATE: After this article was posted, Pauls office sent this statement from the senator: I have always been and continue to be a great supporter of Ronald Reagans tax cuts and the millions of jobs they created. Clearly spending during his tenure did not lessen, but he also had to contend with Democrat majorities in Congress. The tax cuts created jobs, but the spending didnt? ?_?"
"Well, hes not wrong. Reagans whole plan was to out-spend the Soviet Union, and it fucked up the budget for the next 30 years. Carter had a better handle on the budget, but he also plunged us into a bad recession because he wasnt willing to spend to stabilize the economy. "
"I dont know enough about Carter to comment on his legacy; I know he inherited a mess from Nixon and Fords misadventure in Vietnam ( funny that, this democrat cycle of inheriting Republican messes) -- I do know Reagan was a nutter and that he (along with Thatcher in the UK) instituted their radical neo-liberal policies of tax cuts for the wealthiest and the de-regulation of markets that history will tell us was the beginning of the end of Americas golden era. "
Do these politicians not realize that we live in a time where anything that theyve said publically is easily retrieved to rub in their smug little faces when they try to lie? So stuck in the past. 
I dont want Rand Paul to lose a presidential bid because Republicans see him as one more to add to their ever-growing pile of not true Republicans to demonize. Folks should lose elections for clear and repeated acts of disingenuousness. The (R)s have such an enormous list of folks theyre trying to please without actually letting anyone know that Id be surprised if they could ever come up with someone capable of cutting through all the crap. Just the fear of fiscal conservatives to appear weak on defense is enough of a fundamental conflict of interest to keep me from entertaining the party in the near future. But Congress will probably be violently overthrown before *that* ever changes.
"My reaction if true: Well, bye bye Rand Paul. Was nice knowing ya. Way to commit political suicide!"
And? Rand Paul is still a racist dickhead fucking asshole with a made up medical degree. He can still GTFO.
Who cares. they are gone. Focus on whats in front of us geez
"Somebody is making an appeal to the left in preparation for a presidential run. While I agree with him, Im not impressed. I do not think much on his idea of a budget. "
Paul shares one trait with Reagan: Alzheimers syndrome.
"Man, this guy is throwing more red meat than a hot dog vendor."
"brave move, discrediting the conservative Jesus like that."
"Its a bold strategy, Cotton. Lets see if it pays off for em. "
Hes right. Im surprised to hear it. But he is right. Reagan was simply too incompetent on management and economics to be good on the budget. 
"Except for every presidential historian who disagrees, putting Carter toward the back with the worst residents, and Raegan at the front/front-middle depending on who you ask. "
"This is one of the reasons I like the Paul family. While I may not agree on all of their views, at least they say what they believe, regardless of whether it toes the party line."
"Wait, people think Reagan was good at budgeting? "
"Broken clock, etc."
I can only imagine the wing nuts heads exploding at this........even though its clearly true.
"If Rand Paul wants to engage younger voters, maybe he should spend more time making comparisons between presidents who younger voters were actually alive to remember."
Jimmy Cater is a dumbass and ruined the Middle East....i.e. Iran
"He already back-pedaled...after all, cant repeat facts if they disagree with the insane opinions of your extremely right-wing base. The mans got a primary to win, he cant let things like facts or being principled get in the way of winning (more campaign donations). "
"lol Yeah and water is wet, anyone who actually believed in Reaganomics was/is a dim-witted numbskull."
I would also like to point out that it was Paul Volkers actions as fed chairman under Carter that laid the framework for a large part the economic recovery the Reagan administration gets credit for. Carter was actually one of the better presidents as far as forward thinking policies that will be good for the USA long term. Point in case the solar water heating system that was installed in the white house then ripped out later (by Reagan I think as well). Part of the reason Carter is reviled was that Volker set the interest rates extremely high to deal with all the inflation that was hurting the purchasing power of Americans. This resulted in home loans with interest rates you would expect a credit card to have these days.

"Reagan was fucking terrible. But, of course, he just happened to be President while the Soviet Union was collapsing, so that makes him the great. Somehow."
Read it as ru Paul and wondered why he is making political statemasents.
"And hes correct, there is a lot of revision involved in the current deification of Reagan by the right."
prediction - right wing media people will finally realize that plagiarism is wrong
And yet ... 
Exactly.
"Anyone was better on the budget than Reagan. He increased government spending while reducing taxes, paying for it with debt. "
no shit Sherlock 
Arithmetic also says that.
Ooh he just took Lord Reagans name in vain. Thats going to cost him.
jesus was black and ronald reagan is the devil
"If (R)and Paul had just said, Pleas elect me!I have to win for the GOP, and Ill say anything to do it!, he could have saved time. "
This subreddit has officially become insane. Praising Jimmy Carter? None of you dumb teenage liberal fucks were even alive. He was a fucking horrrrrrrible president. This subreddit is like a bizarro universe. 
*gasp* BLASPHEMER!
Guess it must be election season again...
"Wow, this should be proposed as preposterous statement of the year"
Of course he was. Democrats are *always* better at budgeting than Republicans are.
"Rand has some serious work to do in order to be presidential material....but goddammit it hes growing on me. As a left leaning libertarian (social liberal, UBI fan, and border zone on economics) I really want to get behind this dude but cant get over his neocon, tea party, pro life connections. It was funny reading about Republicans being in a fit over Rands view of Cheney...further proving that being a good little neocon, or neoliberal, means you have to ignore the last 15 years. The millennial generation have spent their entire adult lives dealing with war and deceit from the government and have watched the nation tank its own economy.....who really thinks the GOP and hard left Dems are gonna last when there are no more greatest generation and boomers to fluff the vote?"
Ill just leave this here... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bllb_-hr5w
"All propaganda aside from the right wing fascist crowd, Jimmy Carter was most likely the best chance this country had of breaking the oligarchy which tightens its grip on America... not to mention (oops, I did!) that hes the best president America could hope for in the last fifty years..."
Honest question: Why does everyone hate Rand Paul on r/politics?
"well, duh ... "
"Rand understands that he needs to go through the current system to even have a chance of being in contention for the presidential nomination. I feel once he moves past the primary stage and into the general election, he will become much more open in his views. Nader has tried it, Perot tried going on his own too and it just doesnt work out. Even if you dont agree with a lot of what he says, the guy is pretty astute. Once he has the hopes of the Republican part behind him he can start calling the shots. "
Im not a political expert by any means and I dont really have much of an opinion about Carter but my parents hate him. They say the really messed up the farming industry. What did he do? Did he really mess it up or did he just change things to things the farmers didnt like?
Rand Paul? Commence Reddits liberal circlejerk! 
Thats the sort of thing that gets you beat up behind the RNC
Rand Paul with the crossover appeal! http://i39.tinypic.com/2mi5v.jpg
"While true, that doesnt mean Ron Paul understands economics."
"Carter set Reagan up for success. He implemented policies that brought interest rates back to single digits as predicted, yet people like Hannity point to double digit inflation rates as proof of his failure. Those double digit interest rates were there when he took office."
"Have we ever REALLY had a bad president? Sure, we have had some lame ducks and guys who just had nothing to do (Im looking at you Garfield!) but to be fair, when you are president and there isnt a war going on or a financial crisis, you look pretty lazy lol. I always liked Carter and Reagan. I am a democrat too, but you can see the changes both men made in history. Plus, Reagan hated hippies and that made me happy. Now I have to rewatch that movie where some Reagan look alike goes around killing hippies... Wtf was it called lol"
Rest of the US: ...........duh!....
"Why does anyone care what Rand Paul says, again?"
Aaaaand he makes a sidestep break for the center?
So Carter is the Democratic Reagan? Mind = blown.
Are pigs flying? Did hell freeze over? A member of the GOP openly admits that Reaganomics was shit and Carter did much better? I cant believe it happened.
Trolling level: expert. 
"Seems that every once in a while, Rand Paul makes an accurate statement."
"Ah the 1980s, when you could get 4% interest on a savings account."
"Carter was a lame duck, this has been established. "
"That is some pretty talk Rand, but itll take a lot more than that before I take you seriously as a candidate."
"Any true conservative knows that Reagan was a hack. In fact, as a registered republican I have made it a personal rule not to take anyone seriously if they ever try and pull this crap off: [Replace 9/11 with Ronald Reagan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOh-rpvjYg) I have my issues with Carter, but Reagan was a real dick to that guy and a terrible president as a whole. My mind is blown that Carter is seen as the worst president. I wouldnt vote for either of them, but I have more issues with Reagan than I have ever had with Carter. Edit: Also, I seriously dont even think I can vote for Rand Paul. The guy is just terrible. I get that he was just backing Romney so that he could have more success when he runs in 2016, but its just so hard to take him seriously at this point. "
The numbers dont lie
"I hope you are right about the pro life caucus ending someday. I didnt mean that Rand is a neocon...He just gets too chumy with those folks if they are in a donating mood, that and he forgets to stick with what hes good at like asking questions about drone strikes and sort of backing decriminalized cannabis."
"While I agree, who cares what Rand Paul has to say about anything at this point?"
Even a broken calendar is right once a year.
"what would make this relevant is if either Jimmy Carter or Rand Paul were legends in the realm of governance. Raygun was a horrible economic turd, but in terms of leadership and governance we have hardly ever known his peer. "
"Yeah well no shit, but facts never mean anything to popular opinion or spin."
Reagan was such a horrible puppet.
This was ever argued?
"God dammit, if Rand Paul keeps this up, I may eventually end up liking him. A little."
RIP Rand Paul 2016 Presidential Campaign 2010-2014
what kind of name is Rand Paul?
And hes right - carter was a very good president 
"Im so torn about this. Do I upvote a story that is positive about Jimmy Carter, or do I decline to upvote a story that is positive about Rand Paul?"
Here... even Democrats didnt like him. http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_were_major_problems_in_Jimmy_Carters_presidency and I dont remember hearing about gas lines during Reagan
"This cant be true - I had 8 different conservatives tell me the other day Reagan cut the deficit... Intelligent man, but Carter was in over his head."
Rand paul also remarks that sky is indeed still blue. 
I am disappointed to not see any references to Jimmy Carter and zero-based budgeting.
"Of course he was! Though Democrats are just as gung-ho on American militarism, overseas wars, and imperialism as are Republicans, Democrats have been *proven* by history to be the real fiscal conservatives and bearer-of-bad-news-austerity compared to the Tweedledum/Tweedledee Republicans. &gt;I mean, Kemp-Roth [Reagans 1981 tax cut] was always a Trojan horse to bring down the top [income tax] rate....Its kind of hard to sell trickle down. -- President Ronald Reagans budget director David Stockman."
"Its a tortured read, a variety of segments, quotes, et cetera to paint *little* Rand Paul as *what exactly?* Read former cabinet officer David Stockmans published works on Ronald Reagans budgets, and stick to your own empiricism for *little* Rand Paul. "
I really dont care what this idiot says about any subject.
"Jimmy Carter was a pretty good President over all, especially in areas of foreign policy when it came to things like the SALT treaty. Yeah, the Iran hostage situation and gas crisis hovers over almost anything from that four years, but its not like ol Jimmy asked the students to take them hostage or flew the helicopter into the plane in the Iranian desert. Eagle Claw was no less daring or preposterous than the mission to kill UBL. I wager history will be much kinder to Carter than W. thinks it will be to him."
"Why is Jimmy Carter suddenly relevant again? Who cares about Jimmy, fucking, Carter?!?!?!?!??!"
Sure some republicans do have high levels of education. However when examining statistics the higher the level of education the more likely the person is to vote blue. There is a ton of material out there. [Here](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/nov/05/larry-sabato/education-level-tied-voting-tendencies/) is just one example I found in like 30 seconds.
"The point was large tech and science corporations in Texas are not a good explanation for a political shift. It can be better explained by the GOPs unwillingness to move with the times or immigration. The article you listed also only had Obama at 8 points higher with people in Georgia that graduated college. Yes its higher, but its not overwhelming. Also, just looking at white people that graduated college, McCain had a 48 point lead. "
"how does my comment make no sense? Also, I did not say that all engineers/scientists are democrats. Youre implying a statement that I did not make and conversation that I did not encourage. Also I work with Republicans that are engineers so no, I do not believe that, however, I think that since a large portion of engs/scientists ARE liberal leaning or support many liberal programs that they help to influence politics. I am one and constantly surrounded by it. I worked with TI many, many times (Mainly Proc Design and LEDs) and a ton of them are not from Texas, but rather move there. Nanotech personal and EEs are a plenty and quite a few of them are liberals. Also, I did not say those companies are the REASON for the change, but rather that they are encouraging it since who they employ decides what kind of votes take place. There is no doubting that tech companies are largely liberal and with it bring those politics with them is my point, just look at hoe much Texas conservatives are losing the votes in large cities like Dallas and Austin. I made a short, general statement. I have no idea where you got your info. "
"FYI, Republicans can be engineers and scientists. Youre entire comment doesnt really make any sense. (As in these companies being the reason for the political change) Source: I live in Texas next to many TI offices. "

Anyone outside of their special bubble is a leech, and would only need it because they are lazy. "
That is a disingenuous description of big government. Government is suppose to actually provide defense per the constitution. The GOP also has not voted one single time to stop the defense sequestration. Thats 52 billion in cuts. Your 2 trillion hypothetical is laughable as well. 
I hate big government - GOP voter that wants to spend 2 trillion more on defense.
This. I wish the shutdown shutdown the military as well. Go big or go home. Instead Hagel put all the DoD workers back to work via some tricky reasoning. So all these red-state heavy defense workers and contractors go back to collecting fat paychecks and voting in Tea Party nuts. This would be hilarious if not so incredibly depressing.
"And in other news, known-Communist Willard Mitt Romney..."
"[Nope](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/18/facebook-posts/facebook-post-compares-elements-romneycare-obamaca/) &gt;In Massachusetts a public option would be a program in which the state is the insurer, and Massachusetts has no such plan. The state oversees the health care exchange, but the plans offered there are all private. The reform law expanded Medicaid in Massachusetts, but that?s a program only for people who cannot afford to purchase insurance. Also on abortions &gt;Romneycare enables people to purchase plans that include abortion coverage. Obamacare does as well, but it also lets states opt out and lets individuals buy plans that don?t cover the procedure."
And has a public option.
 So they should have made it so all employees regardless of hours would have coverage?
"&gt;As shown in the chart below ? using Bureau of Labor Statistics data - the share of full-time workers (in red) has dropped, while the share of part-timers (in blue) has risen.

"They couldve, and shouldve, done a lot of things differently"
"&gt; That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers. But it is indeed a part of the program. If you enact legislation that adds extra operating cost to business but that has an obvious way to avoid that cost, then you have to know that business will work to avoid the extra cost. If the only way for the program to be successful is for the people affected by the program to be stupid or act against their own interest, the program has a problem"
"Why are you being downvoted? What you said makes perfect sense. I feel like this will make people who work minimum wage jobs delve deeper into poverty at first. Instead of having any full-time workers, employers would rather have 2 or 3 extra part-time and make EVERYONE part-time."
"I usually see them taking about how he lied to his voters about is intentions to close getmo, how he lied about stopping the war in the middle east but instead approved a plan for a huge troop surge right after winning the noble peace prize, fast and furious, his use of the DEA to close dispensaries in California that he said he would leave alone, his completely ineffective stimulus plan, the fact that he used the IRS to target conservative political groups and has the worst relationship with Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union.

&gt; There are people out there who cheered and danced in the streets on 9/11 Which countries were they in? 
Yet you still went with it. Using the words people out there rather than some people in a Palestinian refugee camp. Kind of makes a difference dont you think. &gt;US foreign policy is not created in a vacuum: often it is reactionary to other events. Has it never occurred to you that maybe some events are reaction to US foreign policy? Like the unquestioning support of Israel. https://www.hrw.org/by-issue/essential-background/228
"[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_September_11_attacks#Palestinian_celebrations) was what I was thinking of, but [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/rumors/cnn.asp) debunks one of the reports. But, still, people burn our flag, site alight effigies of our presidents. Definitely a lot of hate out there, for us and the Western world at large (Madrid Train bombings, 7/7 attacks, the beheading of Lee Rigby, the Fort Hood shootings, just a few examples of anti-Western messages being put into action). US foreign policy is not created in a vacuum: often it is reactionary to other events."

"Technology is MOST responsible for this inequality. Dont get me wrong, greedy CEOs and lawmakers have made it worse, but lets address the main culprit. [Major advances in technology have favored skilled workers over unskilled workers.](http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter03/technologyandinequality.html) In fact, tech advancements eliminate low-skilled work. Think about a company in the 1950s. Picture the offices. Floor after floor of typists, secretaries, and other low-skilled workers. Those jobs are gone. Eliminated by technology, and the savings went straight to the top. Thats the main reason why CEO pay has ballooned. Technological breakthroughs favor people at the top. This happened in industry after industry. If you can reduce your overhead while maintaining increased productivity, its more money for you and your business. Deregulation, union busting, globalization and the polarization of politics are also responsible. In fact, those factors are why inequality is WORSE in the U.S. than other Western countries, but inequality has risen in nearly all OECD countries."
Freedom from freedom?
"Citizens, Let me remind you that this very fact is what gives our great nation strength. Those who question this, do so with attempts to undermine the very freedom and liberty that attracts millions of immigrants each year. The negative interpretation of these numbers ignores the fact that no nation can match our wealth, and no nation is as safe as America. The fact is, we allow the truly innovative to have no roof over their success, they have capitalized on this. The cost: these bogus statistics, designed to question the American way. Nothing can change the one true fact that we live in free a society which is the envy of the world. Regards, An aspiring propaganda writer "

"Hey /r/politics...who the hell is holding you back? Who is stopping you from living the way you want? Who is stopping you from making the moves to better your situation? If the US is evil and the cause of your woes, why arent you researching better places, getting the skills that are in demand there and setting sail? Yeah, it may involve some pain to make it happen but do you believe the system was designed to prevent you from succeeding?"

"What enrages me is that half the country treats it with apathy, or worse, as a feature of freedom and capitalism, and therefore desirable. The worst of the worst is when a great deal of the country **recognizes** how serious this is and how badly they are getting screwed, yet are still content with voting for the status quo because of their precious guns or liberals kill babies. My gun collection and my right to have the option of shooting people I disagree with is more important than staggering inequality and poverty. /s I understand why Republicans get 1% of the vote - the richest 1%.

"Those who run corporations do not want to fail, if their profits dont grow from quarter to quarter they might be considered a failure. If they cant attract more customers then they have to cut operating costs, so they freeze raises for their bottom wage labor force and perhaps stops hiring, squeezes more work from labor, puts more stress psychological and physical. After a year profits are up 4% from the last. The CEO is happy but now has to face another year of finding profit increases; so he fires the labor that is getting paid the most and hires new people starting at minimum. Maybe sacrifices a dog and a cat to the corporate Gods and stops the air conditioning for the factory. Profits are up 8%. This is something he needs to do every year and he just cuts on his labor, cuts on people, soon it becomes exploitation and the CEO is so removed from his labor force, has so many layers of managers and middle man that he never has to leave his fucking office or visit his production line, he never interacts with his employees and eventually doesnt even consider them human, he considers them sub human, stupid and broken. Justifying his behavior. In his mind he doesnt think hes doing evil, hes just doesnt want to fail. Thats the problem with capitalism and corporate America, you forget about being part of humanity, that you and your neighbor and your corner hobo are fundamentally equal as human beings. "

Im still waiting for that trickle down from the rich. 
"There are a lot of concerns that income inequality causes, but the biggest issue is the cancer raging through our country! Income inequality leads to stagnation in spending, which KILLS economies! Money is the blood of an economy. Imagine siphoning off blood from a loving thing and keeping it in a blood bank. How long before that thing dies? It needs to move and change hands. Our country will die as long as people make more than they can spend."
"This is a direct result of too much money in politics. Our laws are written to benefit large corporations, not the people. Now even the Supreme Court is pro big business. Until we get some meaningful campaign finance reform, things will continue to get worse."

"I think one of the reasons for escalating monetary inequality is the expense of higher education. Lets face it, for the most part if you dont have AT LEAST a 4 year degree you will most likely never have the opportunity to make large sums of money. These days a masters degree is the new bachelors in terms of worth. So if you make education so expensive that most people cannot afford it, then what do you expect to happen? the people who can afford it do it and everyone else just simply cannot. People with the education go on to make money while people without, in most cases, literally cannot make that some amount of money. If you really want it you will get it, plain and simple, but you could waste 10 years worth of your money on paying back loans instead of using the money for so many other things. I honesty believe that if the cost of education was reasonable then opportunities for the middle class would skyrocket. "

"Capitalism will only live as long as social mobility is possible. Meaning until people realize that they will never be in the 1% or even the upper 10% they will live the illusion that they are only in their social class for a while, or as Steinbeck put it: Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires. "
"Thats because our nation has gotten progressively lazier, while a few have maintained the American work ethic. /s Edit: Do people not know what the /s stands for? "
and why do you think is the NSA wiretapping and spying on us? The few with power are afraid of the masses. 
Why are we so focused on income equality when what really matters is the standard of living? A wealthy man does not mean he is a happy man.
This is what happens when your financial system is based on usury
"The fewer rich people have their children and pass on that wealth. Since there has always been more lower income people, when they have kids it will always out pace the rich people. The longer this goes the greater the gap will become. That 1% number will get smaller and smaller as more people are born. "
"Income inequality isnt by itself a bad thing. The meaningful issue is how are people on the low end doing. FTA, this is the more telling problem: In 2010, even as overall gross domestic product and productivity increased, the average male worker?s wage fell to $33,751."
"This is how civil war starts, this is how guillotines are invented, history repeats itself. Yet again."

If 1% of you are super-duper-mega rich, and most of the rest of you are just rich, the income disparity doesnt mean that youre poor."
"I dont want to start a new ELI5 thread just for this, so I guess Ill just ask here: Why is income inequality bad? Why is it wrong that some individuals make more money than others? Is it just because of its possible impact on politics?"
Conservatives are convinced a decent wage is unfair redistribution of wealth. The feckless fools.
Dont worry folks this is just the Reddit anti-US bias manifesting through the Washington Post and statistics. Circlebroke will be along shortly to explain.

"Income equality isnt all it is made out to be. It seems some people believe that income equality leads to prosperity and social mobility, and Im going to explain why that is wrong. Income equality does not lead to social mobility or prosperity. Income equality is a consequence, not a cause. Aiming for better income equality is not a magic bullet to making a better society. There are several countries that have better levels of income equality than America. I shouldnt have to tell anyone here that European countries have higher income equality than America, but there are several other examples that may surprise you: [India, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, even Ethiopia have better levels of income equality than America](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/GINI_retouched_legend.gif) So if you can have prosperous nations with higher income equality than America and you can have backwaters like Ethiopia with a higher level of income equality than America, then the rule of correlation =/= causation applies here and, as I said, it is not all it is made out to be. "
"So this is a basic mathematical function of, in the richest country in the world, the rich get richer, but the poor cant get any poorer, correct? Hence the gap grows."
"I think this video is worthy to bring back to give people a visual idea of the extent of inequality in America http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTj9AcwkaKM Though it should be noted that the video is about wealth inequality, which predictably is many many times worst then income inequality (which is already bad enough in the US)"
"Yes but were told we have freedom so were free, right?"
Is there a graph which shows this comparison?
"10 of the top 15 richest counties in America surround DC, including spots 1-3. In 2000, that was only 3. The average federal workers total compensation is over $120k. More than twice the private sector. The government class then tells us that in order to make everyone else more equal, we have to give them even more power and more of our wealth. Curiously exempting themselves. Were being conned."
Capitalism breeds greed.

"(1) The IRS is the worlds best tax investigator. High income people in other countries rarely report their full income. Therefore stats of top 1% in other countries are not directly comparable to ours. We can go there, but its not simple to do. (2) Many groups in the lower 50% intentionally claim lower income (cash hairdressers, bartenders). Also pension accruals whose accrual (a form of wealth) is paid tax-free. Also health plans. The right way to perform this study is who SPENDS the most money over a lifetime and consumes the most goods (college in US = college in Canada). Or, study net worth. Youll find we are still top heavy in the US, but these are better ways to show that. I think taxable income has too many IRS interferences to be a good measure of wealth."
When they wrote the constitution.. no where in there was there even a notion that people should have the same amount of money. Anyone who thinks this article means anything other than some people are rich and some are poor... needs a reality check.
"Correct me if Im wrong here, but isnt inequality kind of inherent in the American dream? What I mean is that from the beginning America was seen as a place where anyone can become very rich if they work hard enough and make the right decisions at the right times. The plan from the beginning wasnt to make a land where everyone is as equal as possible. It was to make a land where it was possible for anyone to achieve great wealth. There was no plan to reset the chess board and start over again with everyone on level playing field again. The rich get richer...And they have. Inequality is just a biproduct of hundreds of years of concentration of wealth. Everyone is fighting for the same piece of bread. Those with lots of bread are continually collecting more and the crumbs become fewer and farther between. Im not saying its good. Im just saying that if we want financial equality, it would require us to significantly change our founding principles. That would mean more money for most, but we would lose the prospect of achieving great wealth as an individual. Maybe I am missing something. Id like to hear anyones thoughts."
"And yet, at no time nor place in the history of civilization has the lowest economic class had a higher standard of living, more luxury items, and as low a fear of dying... Bring on the down votes..."
"&gt; Reich cleverly illustrates how the graph of American inequality over the past century looks like a suspension bridge ? peaking in the 1920s, leveling out because of strong, progressive policymaking in the 1950s and 1960s, and spiking again from the Reagan years through the present. We see the consequences in middle-class families that have fallen off that bridge and are struggling to stay afloat. http://www.migrationinformation.org/datahub/charts/historic1.cfm [Imgur mirror of graph](http://i.imgur.com/ir3hzAB.png)"

"The problem is that money equals debt. From the very moment of money creation, there is interest attached to the dollar, whether loaned to a major commercial bank or exchanged to the government. Then the major commercial bank only releases the money to citizens as more loans with more interest... Think about it, the scarcity is manufactured, because the system can only survive by taking out loans to pay off old loans. Money will never flow to sectors of the population that need it because by the very definition of a debt based economy, there has to be continually more losers in the marketplace. In addition, controlling wealth creation and being on the ownership end of debt allows the major banks to continuously consolidate their wealth and power. Eliminating interest would be fair practice capitalism, and would result in a massively more even equality. It is something that teapartiers and occupy activists can both get behind. No need for scary words like socialism, where you are centralizing the power of money elsewhere, where it is still prone to abuse by psychopaths."
"i tried to explain to wife about the problem but she doesnt see an issue with it, her justification is that the owner(s) of the business should be entitled to any compensation they see fit even if it means paying wages below the poverty level. so, ive come to the conclusion that this disparity is something that we are allowing due to paradigm acceptance, combined with a coalition of elected representatives, financial industry, ceos and boards that makes it difficult for us to change it."

Money is power. Not just spending it. But having lots of money is power. And every worker necessary to create an in demand product should be well rewarded for that creation and not just those with power to get more powerful. Not to mention the serious quality of life issues that affect both the rich and poor with income inequality and it seems senseless that we let this happen. Just stupid is what it is.
I doubt we have a more unequal distribution than the oil states in the middle east or India. Can someone get a better source on this than the article OP posted.
"I feel like this is exactly what capitalism is. We started off as a colony many many years ago under the idea that Money can be made Go make it. In a very shitty way, end game wasnt really thought about in this model. In essence what we thought would happen is exactly what did happen right? The rich got richer and acquired more power that power allowed them to change laws to keep them ahead (look at the inheritance laws that changed after Rockefeller died). And now they the people with money and power are clearly ahead of everyone else, we are calling it unfair and Un-American. If distribution of wealth was equal we would be in essence communist and we already had a pretty big war over that whole Idea. so where do we go now?"

Im surprised this is not in conspiracy like many other regular news articles are at.
Increasing inequality in a society is the single biggest contributing factor to violent revolution: THATS why this should worry you
Yes. This is a problem. Lets fix this.
"Everyone talks about this on a regular basis. Its been proven and I totally agree. But all we do is talk, talk, and talk! Protesting doesnt work. Listing magazine articles doesnt work. I feel like everyone is doing that thinking dont worry, if we bitch about it enough, the problem will fix itself. The answer is no because the people in charge are sitting there laughing about us bitching. So, people, what are we going to do about it? "
"The greatest trick the rich ever played was convincing people in the middle class that they could become rich, if they killed the poor. We are living in the 1920s and classism has supplemented quiet racism."

"Come on, you havent heard about Chilean inequality "
this is the strongest circlejerk i have ever seen on reddit.
Skewed- a lot of people on Welfare have very small incomes because thats all they need to survive.
"The really alarming thing today is that you can actually feel it. There has always been disparity, and there always will but when you talk to somebody older than 50, most of them will tell you that it is bad today. What should be particularly scary for the super rich is that their traditional buffer from the masses: the professional class, is eroding. Someone in their 30s today with a college degree and 10+ years of experience in their field doesnt make anywhere near what they would make in the 1970s, but the owners of the company they work for make 100 times as much. It will eventually break."
This bullshit again?
"And according to the new owners of WaPo, just eliminate minimum wages, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, all laws and regulations that protect workers and eliminate all taxes for the 1%ers............shazam! We will all be rich. "
Its awesome how everyone in this thread know the definite truth about this issue.
Our population is the least homogenous of any developed nation. We have diversity when it comes to laziness and ambition. 
Actually Brazil does. Journalism fail.
"How has this gap expanded? Never government intervention... Government has grown exponentially during this time to take care of the poor. By giving cultures and generations free money and housing, even if barely livable, you take away any impetus for opportunity and risk. All the while government funding goes to crony capitalism, making the rich richer, lobbying ensures this. Our government is giving free money to the poor and to the rich. Why would anyone want to limit government? "
*such news*
"I think that there may be some other OECD countries that are as unequal as the US. We are probably in the worst third of the OECD nations but I dont think we are the worst. On child poverty, for example, [Romania is worse](http://www.unicef.org/media/media_57131.html)."
"How did we get here? The article points out correctly that it was Washingtons influence over the Financial Industry. But the author spat out a typical argument for Washington to solve the problem by giving MORE INFLUENCE over said industry. If Washington had less influence over the financial industry, the housing crisis would not have occurred, college tuition would not be in crisis, millions would not have lost a ton of money in real estate, and the gap would NOT BE AS WIDE. The authors motives are well intended, as are probably most of the people on this thread, but we have to realize the real cause of this situation and understand that we must base our policy on outcomes and not intentions."
Developed my ass. War mongers 
Shocker... Not.
This makes me absolutely sick. I want nothing more than for this to change. I honestly dont even want to live in a country where this is happening - but im left with no choice. 
Imagine all the money in the world... I dont have any of it. :-(
"USE Get a job Barnowl used Get a job. Its not very effective. Corporations have lobbied against a living wage. USE Write Congressman Barnowl used Write Congressman Its not very effective. Congress has been bought by corporations. USE Start Business Batnowl used Start Business. Its not very effective. Banks refuse to loan money to small businesses. USE Protest Barnowl used Protest. Its not very effective. The police are loyal to their corporate masters. USE Violent Overthrow The people of the United States used Violent Overthrow. Its super effective! Money is now distributed to the people who actually work hard to earn it, rather than a small minority of dishonest billionaires. Health Care, infrastructure, and livable wages are all vastly improved. The US once again becomes the greatest nation on Earth."
"Thats because all the rich are living the American dream and made their fortune with no help from anyone. The poor on the other hand are just a bunch of lazy slobs that want free stuff so they dont try hard. If they really wanted to become rich they would pull themselves up by their bootstraps and work harder, then they would be rich too!"
Theres no way we beat China in unequal distribution. The divide between the rich and poor is astounding.

"#1. What is considered rich these days? #2. How many are that rich when you answer #1? #3. Laws should be passed to limit income for all and that would make the poorer richer? #4. A $15.00 an hour minimum wage increase would increase the $33,751 workers annual income? #5. I sure as hell wasnt making close to $48,302 a year in 1978. #6. In 1965 I was making the equivalent of $12,903 annually in 2013 dollars."
So Harvey Weinstein should start giving me some of his millions of dollars. 
"I wonder if there is a way of trying to fit the data of wealth/income per population percentile into a pyramid shape, and then compare the shape of the pyramid with other countries pyramids."
That doesnt sound good.
You cant mention sharknado in a political article and expect me to take it seriously.
Pay no attention to government intervention. Its the free markets fault and dont you forget it! 
"**NeoCons Legacy** With Ronald Reagan getting elected President in 1980, the NeoCon policies pushed onto the American people over the last ~3 decades have greatly increased the income divide in this country. The right-wing Republicans in this country think this is a huge win and they keep on electing candidates that will only make it worse."
"When reading Redditors comments it seems like USA is heading straight to communism or ruthless capitalism. Fuck the middle ground, right?"
"Unless youre in the top 1%, you dont get to determine policy in this country(*Plutocracy*). All of those types arent too interested in changing a system that has given them(allowed them to take) so much. The rest of us *only* have the freedom to infinitely rant about the inequities of the system. Great deal if youre in that top 1%!!"
The gap doesnt matter. Its mobility that does. Anything else is a distraction form the point
I think distribution is a bad statistic. How are our poor doing in comparison to the rest of the worlds poor?

"The general point is well taken. I am literally waiting to get laid off while I expect the CEO will get nicely compensated for his efforts. The history lesson that many forget, or dont know, is that the laissez-faire economists really did set the world free. Adam Smiths wealth of nations set the stage to disrupt the feudal systems into free economies. And allow workers to do what they wanted instead of what they had to do. I dont want to be laid off, but itll beat indentured servitude, debtors prison, etc. "

"Is the problem income inequality, or standard of living?"
"My take on all this is that wealth inequality really has to do with the corporate sector owning the government and spending the last 40 years shaping the system to their favour. Forget about the whole left or right thing. Thats more of a red herring at this point since both parties are connected via corporate influence and both fall under capitalist dogma. I tend to look at it like this: On one side, you have citizens. On the other side is corporations. In the middle is the government. Its like a teeter totter when it should be a set of scales. You want balance between the public and industry. Over the last few decades however, its been corporations tipping the scales in their favour. So now the public needs to re-balance the scales. Socialism is treated as an ugly word by Capitalists. This is because their ideological core is built on greed while Socialism is based on sharing. How much money does one person need? Do they win a prize for having the most? Does it make them better people? Since the 80s, Ive watched how the rich have gone from being well off to super rich, and how the executive class has absolutely destroyed manufacturing and unions in the US. All the cheap shit you guys buy from Wal Mart and practically every other store is made in factories outside of the US. Some are actually inside the US, but its made by low paid prisoners on work programs. In the 50s, at the height of The American Dream, people were able to afford to buy all that stuff because the products were made in the US which created jobs, and because of growing labour laws and factory unions, workers were paid a fair wage while execs &amp; CEOs didnt take home the kinds of insane salaries they get now. Seriously, find me one person who is worth the salary of 200 or 300 employees and Ill show you Superman. Some Ivy League Wall Street connected dick isnt really worth much more than anyone else personally. Ive seen janitors that do more to insure the stability of a company than the owners. Restaurants cant run without dishwashers. People seriously undervalue the working class. In the 80s, companies discovered they could close factories, kill off unions, and send the jobs to places like China, Taiwan, India, etc and pay less to non unionized, exploited labour. Sweatshops, child workers, 14 hour work days, unsafe conditions. These companies killed whole towns by cutting costs and giving themselves raises. Detroit just went bankrupt. A whole fucking city. Thats insane, and no one does shit about it, because a by-product of wealth inequality, is social segregation. The US media depicts poor people poorly. Socially dysfunctional retards who are either criminals or white trash. It tends to make the middle class unwilling to want to help them. Most of reddits demographics is middleclass white kids who have no idea what real poverty is like and think the ghetto is like an Ice Cube movie or The Wire. Chicago is horrible for wealth disparity. thanks Obamas friends. You have massive black on black violence which is nationally under-reported, in some of the poorest communities, while just a few blocks away, you have some of the wealthiest people in the city. Theres no comfort in that. Chicago is closing 50 inner city schools. There was protests. Again, very little coverage. The system itself is rigged on all levels against the public and its only going to keep getting worse unless you guys actually work together on a public level to fix things."
"So? Why do liberals always bitch about income inequality in the US? Even if youre poor in america and make, lets say 25,000 a year. Youre still better off than 80+% of the world. Take this common statistic that liberals like to bitch about: The richest 1% hold 40% of the wealth. When you put that statistic into a reference frame, it seems more reasonable. In order to own wealth, you must have a positive net worth. If you have $1000 in your checking account and owe $5000 in credit card debt, your net worth is -$4000. Which means you have less wealth than someone with no credit card debt and a nickle in his hand."
This is the story of the USA in the last 40 years. The class divide directly causes or effects all other issues and dwarfs terrorism in its importance and damage to society.
Shut up you commie socialist bastards!!
Yawn
What measure did they use for inequality? Standard deviation of incomes? Coefficient of variation of incomes? Difference between the 1% and 99%? 
Step 1: identify the problem Step 2: propose a solution Still waiting...
"of all the web sites, no one talks about this more than reddit "
Is there a difference between distribution of wealth and income? I was under the impression that the gap between rich and poor in China was the worst in developed countries
"I am not sure I understand the problem. The concept that the average worker is earning less now than they were in 1978 might be an issue worth solving, but it also might be a stat pulled right out of someones ass. Are those dollar amounts directly comparable to each other? Do they mean anything relative to the average cost of living in 1978 vs today? Why was 1978 chosen (it seems rather arbitrary)? If someone makes more money than they would reasonably spend in a year, does it really matter how much more they make than that amount? It is my perspective that inequality is not a problem. Poverty is a problem. Abuse is a problem. Corruption is a problem. Well, maybe it is a first world problem (a la Sue cant decide between lobster or filet mignon for lunch). "
There is only one solution to this problem: **MORE PROLEFEED**
"Because the Red Scare has negated our ability to tax the population on a level playing field, so I lose 30% of my meager pay while some billionaire plays 3 card monte with his and enjoys the favorable rate he lobbied for. If I could only afford a lobbyist, but I am a member of the unfortunate, so that is out of reach."
"All men are created equal, but does that have to mean equal pay? This country is supposed to be one where you get what you work for. People didnt immigrate to this country for equal benefits for everyone, they came to this country to make FOR THEMSELVES a good living. However I now understand that it all depends on who you support and who happens to like you. Were off to hell in a hand basket. "
"So, what should we do?!"
"The entire conceptual model employed by this headline is a contrivance for the sake of a political agenda. No nation has any distribution of income. Nations are abstractions that often group disparate people, pursuing disparate goals, arbitrarily together. There is no such thing as a distribution of income - everyone generates their own particular income via their own endeavor; income does not originate in some aggregation thats subsequently divided unequally among different people. When people talk about distribution of income, theyre adding everyones separate incomes together, then analyzing who has a higher or lower proportion of that total; but no one ever seems to posit any justification for aggregating everyones separate income values into a single figure in the first place."
Yet there are those whom are not if the wealthy elite who still defend them and kiss their rings like good servants. Class war is being waged my friends.
"Honestly as every day goes on, I think the US would more than thrive as a Communist nation."
"revolution starts tonight at 6pm eastern my house, there will be Hors doeuvre! "
"Problem is with America, theres a lot of stupid people who still think everyone should be self-reliant, let corporations get away with everything, but the reality is, the corporations and rich suck up so much taxpayer money, and want looser regulations so they can make even more money. Look at CEO and other executive pay. Its gone through the roof, while they make the rank and file people that do the really hard work, work for peanuts, then come up with bullshit hoops for them to jump through. The corporations get away with murder because no one questions them."
"I think people now are just complacent. It used to be that both Republicans and Democrats new how bad income inequality was for society. Republicans especially since they are the party of capital knew that it was a bad idea to try and crush the working class and squeeze everything out of them or youd start to develop a social movement away from capitalism, since throughout the early to mid 20th century social economic movements were succeeding everywhere. With capitalism taking over in most parts of the world things have changed. Just like within a capitalist economy you need competition to keep things going, capitalism itself needs competition to keep things right. The capitalists at the top have to want capitalism to work and show its better than whatever other system the workers want, that doesnt happen anymore. Ever since capitalism won the cold war, capitalism as a viable sustainable economic model, free from revolution and benefitting those willing to put in the work is declining quickly. "
From number 1 to number last.
"Im not sure why this is a bad thing. Why is unequal distribution of income an intrinsically bad thing? Why arent we allowed to have some rich people and some (or, in this case, many) poor people? The poverty standard is still light years beyond third world countries. I have big issues with people being cheated or short-changed or hamstrung in their drive to success, but as I look back on my own life, Ive been willing to make less money as a trade off for other, more valuable things, like time with my wife and family. I dont expect to compensated the same as, for example, my boss. In fact, I sort of wear it as a badge of honor that Im willing to give up income for these better options."
"Obviously the only solution is to lower taxes on the rich, as theyre the job creators! "
working as intended
"President Eisenhower, come back! "
"Capitalism is what propagates inequality. The reality is that some people operate better under a Capitalist system than others. Once they get an upper hand, their advantages compound. "
"I dont people making money and having lots of wealth, especially if they earned it. Even if they inherited it. What Im against is those people manipulating the system so that they amass more and more wealth at the expense of the well-being of less-wealthy people."
"Bread and Circus. As long as the masses are entertained the rich can do what they want. Carry on, nothing to see here. "
Things are so bad that it will not be long before there is no option but to protest and set up tent camps in the capitol. All it takes is for 1 million of the unemployed to camp out in DC for the politicians to have no other option but to create jobs. They are not going to be able to use the police or even the army to move 1 million people out of their camps.And there are way more than 1 million people that have lost everything and become homeless due to the Greed and ability to get away with theft by the rich.
This title is such a crock of bullshit.
" Overall, the debate should concentrate less about how much the top 1 percent earn in comparison to the 99%; good for the 1% for making a lot of money. The debate is less about how much the rich make and more about how easy it is for individuals to make more money and become richer. The barriers to entry into higher levels of wealth should be the topic of discussion and not how much does X person have in comparison to Y. Good for those that have gotten over the wealth hurdle (Even if they were born into it). Hopefully, these two videos provide insight on this topic: Are the Poor Getting Poorer? http://www.learnliberty.org/content/are-poor-getting-poorer What isnt explained about wealth inequality. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44LHBViTZI0"

"What can I, as a regular person, do to help this situation? Im sure someone out there has a/several answers and I know it would help me as well as all of the other people that would see this if you would use your insight to help. Thanks!"
"Ive been hearing the phrase The rich get richer my entire life and Im 66. Is it true? Who knows? All writers, both right and left wing, use provocative language to get attention from viewers, as they are in a highly competitive business. They bring up topic after topic but never offer any solutions. So mostly theyre very highly paid rabel rousers."
all according to play then. 
"This is not a failure of capitalism, this is a failure of government. It is the responsibility of government to maintain equality and a stable environment of business. It is the responsibility of capitalism to maximize the resources of its environment."
Extremely impressed with the level of awareness in these comments. Id hazard a guess and say most of you are students - when the mantle is passed to you guys America will really start changing.
"You know, some of these top 10 percenters do philanthropy work. Like David Koch has donated 100 millions of dollars in arts and sciences. Or Bill Gates and his work in Africa. Or Warren Buffet donating $31 billion dollars to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."
Unequal distribution really isnt the problem. If some exec is making 5million vs 20 million it doesnt matter. If some poor fuck is on welfare vs welfare or minimum wage vs slightly higher minimum wage now. The problem is social movement. Its now far less likely for someone born into poverty to become middle class or rich. Which is really the goal of the USA; the american dream is about having the very poor and the very rich and through your own skill you become what you earn. So if you are good at what you do... for example a really good pig farmer you could become uber rich. However if youre a total fuckup you forever live in poverty. The problem is that you can be really good at what you do but for some reason in the USA you never tend to promote yourself.
"Get rid of poor people, restore equitable distribution. Problem solved."

"Its like a race to get power/money so that you will have enough connections to cash in on big political movements / bank movements... its like a prison fight for scraps - a violent, unorganized mess of gangs... instead of putting ourselves in that bad situation we should work together and build technology / develop cities and focus our resources on growth... that way our entire society gets richer and we slowly all get richer... however, I think the startup culture that has had a rebirth in this country is powerful and awesome... even if larger companies will typically buy out the good technologies, money is still invested in the market so growth occurs. Ive realized, and it aint news, that the US is just a warmachine and our politicians are the world salesmen. But I feel as if we are waiting for bad things to happen just to pounce on a country and take control of it... honestly there are worse things happening every day somewhere than what happened in Syria, not saying it wasnt/isnt horrific and that it shouldnt be fixed, but I am just saying people are getting fucked up everywhere by everything. We are all mostly, in 1st world countries , disconnected from war because we are accustomed to running water, tons of the fattiest/carbiest/delicious-est food buyable in seconds, AC in our cars that run on everyones damn oil, and Miley Cyrus twerking (why not). These other countries have motherfucking bombs going off or dont even have enough water per day to wash my ass... why dont we invest in areas that are poor in both our own country and others instead of attacking people and spawning more and more terrorists? Dont they see that it is a virus that replicates... it is already in the system, this isnt a motherfucking bacterial infection that can be cleared out. STOP FEEDING IT and take it out with specialists (antibodies) instead of starting wars. Motherfuckers. Anyway, there are too many people struggling here. If I was a billionaire Id donate to education, healthcare, food, housing, etc. but I would I really give away all my money like Bill Gates/Warren Buffet/others are doing? Probably not, but I would kind of do what Bill Gates is doing except with a focus on biology and healthcare development. I think that is primary along with energy (which Mr. Gates is highly invested in) but of course education fuels all of this. "

Lets see how the Guns and Paulses downvote bridgades deal with this story.
"&gt; the collapse of Lehman Brothers ? fueled by a toxic combination of deregulation, subprime lending and credit-default swaps... Funny how subprime *borrowing* wasnt listed there. On one hand, yes, the subprime borrowers were perfectly rational actors. On the other, so were the lenders that could unload those mortgages on either buyers. Both were knowingly dealing in bad debt. The issue that people dont talk about as much is how public policy has been used to push homes onto people who might be better off renting. The financial crisis of 2008 might have exposed inequalities, but what led up to it wasnt really the cause of those inequalities."

"See, it is a game theoretical problem: Inequality may be bad for the people of a given country. But it allows the country to produce a lot worldwide. Hence there is a tradeoff for inequality: If you want a more equal country, you will have to reduce your relative economic might in the worldwide scale. Hence what is good for the US is not necessarily good for the people of the US, at least not the average US person. Did you want the US to be at the top of the world in terms of might? Then you cant really complain about domestic inequality... "
"Rich, Poor, Black, White, haves, have-nots. What Ive noticed constantly in /r/politics is the whole ignorance of the middle and how this black and white rhetoric destroys those who are in the middle class. The rich people want to refer to are the mega wealthy who find refuge in our tax system here to come live and play but the brackets that are lumped in with them are the working middle and upper middle class and suffer losses to needless tax hikes when that money should be put back into their companies for growth and job creation. Some of the hardest working people in the world reside in this bracket and they are seen as fat lazy cats. People need to iterate this more. Talk up those who contribute a whole lot through their hard work when they deserve it. Not just talking down those who earn a lot. "

"Really? Sounds like someone hasnt been to India ever, Katrina Heuvel. Take a trip and go see the Taj Mahal. No matter how you get there youll see nothing but poverty. Plus subdivisions and malls for the affluent. Then people living in huts made of brick without mortar they built themselves right on the side of the street. They sell tea or wares outside, barely scrape by, and push their kids into begging guilds. I see NOTHING like that in the USA. Take a trip and get some culture let me know when that passport gets stamped, then Ill read your editorial."
Prediction. I will get all the rich peoples money. They who have never known poverty will live under the poverty level for the rest of their lives.

Yes thats right, ban them from being on any board of directors, becoming a lobbyist, going and working for a big bank (Many do this!!!), any job whatsoever. Pay them a life long salary of 100k+.

"Why isnt money created out of thin air through fractional reserve banking and quantitative easing addressed here? Yes the rich have more money than they used to, but there is also a lot more money! Also the corporations get bailouts with newly minted money and buy materials at prices that the market was adjusted for before this new money was created. Fractional reserve banking and the Federal Reserve bank caused this problem. Corporations have been around for a very long time and only relatively recently are people screaming and yelling to regulate them, what changed? Corporations suddenly got greedy?

Its also disingenuous to say that people didnt want limits on inheritance and aristocracy.
"[Thomas Paine felt the same way Jefferson did.](http://www.economist.com/blogs/lexington/2010/10/estate_tax_and_founding_fathers) [And Benjamin Franklin.](http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jan/21/jay-hottinger/rep-jay-hottingers-assessment-founding-father-unfo/) [Congress first passed estate taxation in 1797.](http://hnn.us/article/794) &gt; [A State divided into a small number of rich and a large number of poor will always develop a government manipulated by the rich to protect the amenities represented by their property.

"I appreciate you providing other sources for your claim. Now, if we look at the history of estate taxation, it has a very stormy one. Until 1916, estate taxation was used to fund wars, and was repealed soon after. In fact, the very proponent you first mentioned(Jefferson) was elected on his isolationist policies, and he along with Congress repealed the estate taxation in 1802, just 5 years after it was enacted. So even though they intermittently supported it, it was obvious they didnt support it to the extent in which it currently exists today. "
"I think its rather intellectually dishonest to say that the founding fathers wanted to limit inheritance and as evidence you list the opinion of *one* of the founding fathers. If indeed many, or most of the fathers had held this opinion that this was necessary, why did we not have a consistent estate tax until 1916? Furthermore, if you read what Jefferson wanted to do, it was to stop primogeniture inheritance, where the eldest got everything, and have it so it was equal among the deceaseds heirs. "

"Not only was Part D unfunded but it was passed specifically without cost-reduction measures that exist in other parts of Medicare. This was a two-pronged policy. On the one hand it was to court the votes of the all-important elderly voting bloc for the upcoming 2004 presidential election, which somewhat worked. Passing the bill would also benefit pharmaceutical companies (our tax dollars used to subsidize the purchase of their pills) and keeping out cost-reduction measures would have the pharmaceuticals benefiting even more. The Democrats, who have a priority of expanding social services, were willing to pass it without funding because it was the only way it was going to get passed. Republicans in the House were actually against it (because they are against expansion of social services) but the vote was held open for an unusually long time (until 4am) until enough Republican arms could be twisted to get the bill passed.

And they cant have the dems doing popular things..especially healthcare. Nope starve the beast says the dems must be the mean old scrooge who tells people their taxes must go up or services must be cut. and now the Obama admin, which cut the bush deficit in half(which means we would be in surplus if he inherited a country without a deficit) and he has less federal employees than reagan... but he is the big government fiscally reckless dude."

Oh well just call a backdoor national registry universal background checks and all those fucking idiot liberals in college and on /r/politics will eat that shit up!!!!

"&gt;And the Manchin Tooney bill explicitly prohibited a national registry. Just like how we forbid an income tax, and lying to the American public, and fiat currency, and torture, and wars of aggression, and warrantless wiretapping, and on and on and on."
"Happy cake day. The bill merely expands the existing background check system that has been around for 14 years, and there is no background national registry yet. And the Manchin Tooney bill explicitly prohibited a national registry. (Fact check: **[True](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/18/barack-obama/obama-says-bipartisan-background-check-plan-outlaw/)**) So, how do you figure it creates a new *backdoor* background check?"
"Yeah, because counting children and retired people as unemployed totally makes sense."
"If this number is true, then roughly one out of three people you know would be out of work. Is this the case? Probably not."
Wall Street Adviser Sounds trustworthy 
"&gt;Policies that remove the barriers to employment, thus decreasing this number, are obviously beneficial Except he means repealing minimum wage laws, busting unions, ending benefits for full time workers, and generally letting businesses treat their workers like companies in China do. Hes talking about turning massive unemployment into massive underemployment and poverty. Yes, in that reality hes constructed in his head more people will have jobs. But something else will happen: people who already have jobs wont be able to *live* on those jobs because companies will gut benefits and cut wages exactly as fast and as deep as the government allows them to. The wealth gap will increase, the middle class will shrink, and all of the benefits will ripple up while all of the detriments of such as system will be squarely placed on the shoulders of the least in society."
And its entirely the fault of the party that controls half of Congress and hasnt been in the Presidency since 2009.
"His 37.2% is the percentage of people not in the work force, not the percentage of people who are unemployed. Sloppy numbers. "
Unemployment sucks but underemployment is killing America. 
"Dudes numbers are dramatically inflated, although I have no doubt that the current unemployment number is artificially low. Factor in children and seniors as well as people disabled enough to be unable to work, college students not looking as well as others who have voluntarily removed themselves from the workforce (stay at home parents, etc.) and sure, the number of people not working is quite high. However, that isnt an accurate portrayal of the American workforce. My straight-out-of-my-ass suspicion is that the real number - meaning people who want to work and cant get it and people who want to work more than they are currently- is somewhere between 10-15%. "
"Shocking that a Wall Street adviser finds substantially higher numbers for unemployment, inflation, and misery, and the solution is remove barriers to employment. Reading between the lines, that sounds an awful lot like an agenda to enact policies to boost the earnings on Wall Street couched in the cynical lie that itll benefit the little man."
Where are the job creators and why have they abandoned us? (and why are we still giving them tax cuts?)
"http://m.washingtonexaminer.com/wall-street-advisor-actual-unemployment-is-37.2-misery-index-worst-in-40-years/article/2542604 Wall Street adviser: Actual unemployment is 37.2%, misery index worst in 40 years "
"Yes, we know theyve been lying to us about unemployment figures. Whats your point?"
"Deception is coming from the left and the right on unemployment. The number of people that are looking for work is higher than the reported unemployment percentage, but it is much lower than right wing propagandists suggest. When unemployment benefits run out, people are considered to have stopped being part of the unemployed. Its deceptive."
"So we are including retirees, children, war vets, disabled, embryos, and house cats?"
"I just checked my RLERUIFWDHAPITWH (Rush Limbaugh Endorsed Republican Unemployment Index For When Democrats Have a President In The White House) source and, in fact, unemployment is at a whopping 1403% right now. Impeach all the libtards, please. "
"This is certainly a tilted article. It is OK (but perhaps meaningless) to define a new metric, but it is obviously designed to slander the current administration. calculates the actual unemployment rate of those not working at a sky-high 37.2 percent, not the 6.7 percent advertised by the Fed is mixing apples and oranges. Using the metric they just defined, what was their unemployment index in, say, 2008?"
"If you are not looking for a job, you are not unemployed. For example as I understand the ravings of this crackpot, women with newborn babies who are caring for them are unemployed. His solution is brilliant: Go buy a gun quick and get those moms back to work."
"These numbers are outrageous. People that arent currently working doesnt equate to unemployment. College kids with rich parents, stay at home moms, and older folk that are retired are willingly unemployed, not as a result of economic hardships. Not to mention the wide array of under the table work that is very common throughout the country. Ill be the first to admit the governments unemployment figures are flawed, but off by 30% is laughable."
"Well, if you include infants and toddlers, the figure is probably accurate."
"What I want to see is a figure that lists percentages of people making a range of income (say 0, $1-5000, $5000 - 15,000, etc) in tandem with hours worked. That govt employment stats do not include those not getting unemployment makes them automatically bogus, and there is also an issue of many jobs that DO exist being temporary and/or part time - things that are essential in assessing the true health of the economy."
Its hard to give any credibility to the figures that are shown when the anchor is such a douche.
The under employment rate is even more devastating. When you have people with college degrees and 10 years of professional work experience backtracking into minimum wage jobs thats where the real problem lies. 
I thought the [misery index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misery_index_%28economics%29) was simply unemployment rate plus inflation rate. How does the article cite a misery index thats lower than the unemployment rate? (Im asking seriously; I dont understand.)
Basic income ftw.
"This has ALWAYS been the way we calculate unemployment. If we changed the calculation now, we would be unable to compare our data with any previously reported numbers. "
He then demanded additional tax cuts for the richest 1% of Americans.
Wall Street adviser: end of story.

"OH NO. RETIRED PEOPLE ARENT WORKING. QUICK, EVACUATE THE NURSING HOME STRAIGHT INTO THE FACTORIES."
"If we change the very definition of unemployment, the unemployment rate will change. Good to know."
"Headline should be, Wall Street Hustler Dislikes Democrats. What a crock. That 37.2% is merely the [share of Americans over age 16 who are not working](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000)--including retirees, students, nonworking spouses, etc.. It is not the unemployment rate. But leave it to Rupert Murdoch to shovel bullshit with a backhoe."
"Is this the same Wall Street adviser that convinced American manufacturing to close down factories in the U.S., and then reopen them in Asia, Mexico, etc?"
" The value of the unemployment rate is for comparison. Is the economy getting better or worse? That means, whatever measurement you use , it has to be consistent over time. The government actually provides other statistics for unemployment. You can look them up if you choose to.http://www.bls.gov/"
"Well yeah, but how are corporate profits doing ?? Dont focus on the little people..."
"At this very moment Rush is on the air pounding his meaty fists onto his EIB desk, demanding that this is the real unemployment number, that Obama himself is responsible for cooking the government numbers, and that the Tea-publican base should be angry about it. This article goes a long way to prove to the already faithful that the POTUS is a liar. This BS is their gospel. Next, he will be attacked for reporting on something so skewed. He will claim that he is the victim and that he was simply commenting on the article. He will claim that the media is biased. The base will be satisfied. Rinse and repeat. This is why we are so deadlocked. Fuck!"
So bring back the Works Progress Administration. Our infrastructure problems and unemployment problems all solved at once. I find it a better solution than wasting billions rebuilding countries we destroyed.
BULLSHIT
So this means its easier to find a job?
"Im a little confused, does that 37.5% include seniors and children? or is that only adults between the working age?"
Quick somebody get all these unemployed grannies and 7 year olds their jobs back!
"For those that are not satisfied with the current system and want to see it change please call your representatives regularly. Let them know where you stand.

You do not have to wait for an election or a petition to have a voice. This is very easy to do and hardly takes any time. Try the steps I provided one time and gain an appreciation for how easy it is to let our voices be heard.

"I did my own independent study. Since I have a Series 3,6,7, and 24 Licenses along with Licenses in Life, health, and Variable annuities and a license to teach economics and history. I am fully qualified to tell my Reddit investors that the unemployment rate is fully 100% and the misery index is infinity times infinity to the the infinity power. What I am saying is, this is a sales pitch. Nothing more, dont be fooled by Wall Street Advisers. Chimps throwing darts are right just as often as these clowns. Edited for style. "

All the statistics about how unemployment is calculated are available to the public. The different considerations from which the number is derived ~~is~~ are literally on the BLS web site for anyone to see. They are not trying to trick anybody. Edit: word
"How much worse would unemployment be if we downsized the DEA, prisons and military industries?"
Nice distortion. My wife is a stay-at-home mom and doesnt work by choice. This Wall Street adviser counts her (along with millions of others who are not seeking work) toward his *skewed* unemployment numbers.
Why does this kind of stuff get upvoted in r/politics? I wish I could find actual journalism around here.
People are always making the common sense argument against the unemployment numbers. Its not based on the *real* unemployment! If they took 20 minutes to research how the Bureau of Labor Statistics comes up with that statistic (which is impressive in its complexity and robustness) they would realize that they have no idea how statistics work and they are not qualified to argue against the BLSs numbers.
"its a pretty sensationalist headline/article. they are correct that the number the government puts out is inaccurate and doctored due to excluding people who havent found jobs from the work force (and counting people who are working part time jobs but seeking full time jobs as employed), but they went to the other misleading extreme with their claim. you cant take every person in the country without a job and count them as unemployed. this is going to include stay at home moms, disabled people, rich people who dont have to work if they dont want to, and retirees. for all we know, they could even be counting any college students who are coming from a wealthy enough backing to just go to school and not work. there is plenty of real evidence to attack the official numbers, use that instead of equally (and calling it equal is a stretch) inaccurate numbers."
Thanks Obama.
"This is a joke. Nobody toting these kinds of ludicrous statistics (see some of the high voted comments for excellent explanations of why theyre ludicrous) and advice to get a gun is anybodys Wall Street advisor. Seriously people, this is what happens when you link to the Washington Examiner. "
"Unemployment refers to the percentage of those not working (like a resource not being employed, get it?) who are a part of the work force, which is made up of those either working or seeking work. This number refers to both those who are and are not a part of the work force who are not working."
"I always thought the official unemployment figures were a big fat lie, like the GDP, the COLA measure, and all such stats. "
"&gt; Marotta, who recently advised those worried about an imploding economy to get a gun, Gee, think this is a CINO telling other CINOs what they want to hear. Next pointless opinion from a conservative in name only please."
"Dont worry America, you dont need a security net like Europe has, because you dont have unemployment."
This article cites exactly no real evidence to support this outrageous claim. Fucking stupid. 
"Since this headline is obviously bullshit, as people have repeatedly pointed out in the comments, shouldnt this be removed and/or mass downvoted? In a just world, I guess."
govt needs to give basic income for everyone that needs it. 
Total bullshit. 
"The Unemployment rate (U3), as posted by the U.S. Government, is a measurement of the number of people receiving unemployment insurance. People that are no longer recieving Unemployment are not counted in the U3. This is why we can loose 200,000 jobs in one month, while gaining only 150,000. But the U3 goes down by 50,000 instead of up by 50,000. Because, at that same time 100,000 people were taken off of Unemployment. http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/unemployment-charts"

"I dont know, I thought [Heirs to Thievery](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09qomwPTOM8) was a pretty solid album. Didnt think theyve been around for 40 years, though. "
"Yea that 37% number is a little high. When something seems too outrageous to be true it likely is. The way they describe this number it seems like it includes the entire U.S. population. Possibly the retired and children. Edit: Here are some quick facts from the census: People over 65: 13.7% People under 18: 23.5% Oddly enough that totals 37.2%. If this unemployment number is separate, that would mean that close to 74.4% of the US population do not work, or 3 of every 4. Source: http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html"
"People can believe the real govt unemployment figures, but it doesnt jibe with all the massive growth of homeless people pulling rolling suitcases &amp; backpacks ive seen in my town over the last 4-5 years."
I downvoted this article because it is misleading. 37.2% is just 100% minus the workforce participation rate. The workforce participation rate has been between 60-70% for about twenty years. The fact that workforce participation has gone down 5% or so during a period where unemployment has also dipped about 5% tells us nothing we shouldnt expect. When you consider that the baby boomers are in the process of retiring this number really isnt very scary.

"I guess we should forget about the [stimulus package](http://www.factcheck.org/2010/09/did-the-stimulus-create-jobs/) that helped create and keep jobs. &gt; The truth is that the stimulus increased employment by between 1.4 million and 3.3 million people, compared with what employment would have been otherwise. That?s according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office."
Wow. Youll believe anything the Obama spin machine cooks up wont you? No job lock hence less people working increases productivity? We are doomed.
"Short answer: I think the law wont affect you much if you have insurance through an employer. As I understand it, you will pay more through an exchange because right now your company pays for some of your plan and you pay for some of it with pre-tax dollars. You would have to spend post-tax money through an exchange, your company would pay nothing, and you may not qualify for any subsidies. But the idea is open competition and everyone having insurance will drive those prices down some. Someone who works at a company with no health care can use pre-tax money and get subsidies. So that could give you the option of switching to a new job without healthcare and getting it through the exchange for an affordable price, and the option of keeping that insurance when you went to another job. If you lose your job you will qualify for more subsidies, or maybe medicare. But I am no expert on this."
1) The US has substantially lower job lock than the rest of the world. Employees in the US change jobs often and with little difficulty. 2) Spinning people not working as stronger families is an unusual flavor of traditional conservatism/populism. 3) Preventative care doesnt save money. This is one of the most persistent lies regarding healthcare: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money-it-doesnt/

"&gt;Dont forget the end of job lock -- no more staying in a job you hate just for the insurance. That should increase productivity and mental health. Get back on the ladder of life, serf. /s"
"1) Id like to see a link on that, but are you comparing staying at a job you because you want to with job-lock? Americans no longer get pensions and companies rarely try to keep employees for long periods anymore. I dont think Ive worked anywhere more than 3 or 4 years while my dad (who has a pension) worked 45 years for the same company and resisted retiring until 68. Meanwhile, I had a coworker who had to quit and work elsewhere so his wife could continue to see her doctor when our health plans changed. That would never occur in almost all the rest of the developed world. Nor even Cuba... 2) Im not sure if you are saying having a stay-at-home parent is not good for a family or just commenting? 3) I did not know that. I would argue its obviously true for things like vaccines, or managing a disease like diabetes that can send people to the ER, but overall apparently it is not. But regardless, if the price is the same for letting Americans die of preventable diseases or allowing them to live a long and productive life, call me a crazy liberal but Im for the latter."
"Theres no job-lock, but theres still regional or state-border lock. Were not anywhere NEAR a developed nation, unless youre looking at the wealth transferrence - from the public to the investor 1% in medical insurance industry end of it. The best hospital in the area I live in is over the border in Maine, and my MD is there. Ive always paid cash for everything Ive needed and paid in installments - less than a monthly insurance bill - for the surgery I had and now Im fairly fucked, since the plan offered on the exchange where I live doesnt GO over state lines. I am NOT changing medical providers to suit the profit-making whims of BlueCross, that IN New Hampshire is NOT non-profit. Fuck them. My health and medical needs are more important to me than their financial concerns. OR Barack Obamas ego. End. Of. Story. We really NEED a Single Payer to put ALL of this bullshit to rest. THEN we will be a *developed* nation.. and a civilized one that puts limits on how much profit can be made off of sickness and infirmity. I shouldnt HAVE to refuse to buy insurance and decide the option to keep the physician I am choosing, will come at the cost of disobeying a law designed supposedly to help me. This is not help, its a hindrance and its made it VERY unlikely that Ill vote for any Democratic candidate. In the medical care meltdown this country is facing, insurance isnt the answer, it is the PROBLEM. Single Payer NOW."
"Can you explain this to me? Im new and Ill admit ignorant to this for a 27 year old. I looking into the obamacare plans through the site and I found nothing that would cover me at a better rate than my job, which is fairly expensive... If I were to lose my job is be left with one of these plans, which I couldnt afford without a job of course. So if Im between jobs and I have just enough for my rent, Im really left without insurance... Or at least I cant pay for it.... "
"One sure-fire way to tell if I meant something is to check if I said it. Lets look. Nope, never said that. Heres what I did say: &gt; Dont forget the end of job lock -- no more staying in a job you hate just for the insurance. That should increase productivity and mental health. Personally, I know I am more productive in a job I love versus a job I hate. Arent you? &gt; No job lock hence less people working What do you mean hence less people working? Are you suggesting we have a 0% unemployment rate, so that if a worker took themselves out of the workforce that job would remain empty and unproductive? Because I can assure you that is not the case: there are people who want to be working and productive but currently cant get work or are underemployed, and would quickly replace the people who no longer wanted to work. And theres a good chance people who want to work will be more productive than people who dont want to work when doing the same job, at least after some initial ramping-up period. And you are aware that it was Repubicans who were initially against job lock, right? https://grabien.com/file.php?id=10708"
"Dont forget the end of job lock -- no more staying in a job you hate just for the insurance. That should increase productivity and mental health. And the elderly will be able to retire, and moms or dads stay at home raising the kids if healthcare is more affordable. The result of that is stronger families and more job openings for the unemployed and underemployed and could even increase wages. And the preventative care should also lead to much lower health care bills lower premiums, less people in the ER, etc. etc. Almost like were a developed country or something."
"&gt;Our government spends more than enough to provide a European style universal healthcare system Well, we are always going to have a large military. It obviously needs to be cut significantly, but considering that we will always have larger military spending that European nations, we still need more revenue. Additionally, we have a pretty large budget deficit. Even without military spending, we are in the hole. "
"You mean sorta like what Mr. Bill did, back when we actually HAD a stable economy?"
&gt;We cant just tax the rich our way to prosperity. Im willing to give that a shot for a change.
I dont get the impression that people on the left want more than they are willing to pay for. It seems to me they want to increase taxes on some groups in order to pay for the services and also they want the portortion of money spent of defense to be spread to other areas. I mean personally taxes hit me harder than I would like but im ok with it because it helps others out thw problem is a lot of that money isnt going to help but just gets funneled into defense. Which I work for dod so I ubderstand defense is a broad term so im kind of more understanding of it. But then you have shit like 50 plus million dollars spent on trying to repeal obamacare that drives me insane that is our money being wasted. 
"&gt; Actually, what you said wasnt true. The Middle Class DOES spend as much as Northern European in taxes. [Really? Where the heck did you get that idea?](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/10/focus-4) Our middle class is siginificantly lower taxed than Northern Europe. [A middle class person in the US is going to pay roughly half in overall taxes compared to Sweden or Denmark.](http://www.ibtimes.com/tax-rates-individual-workers-pay-oecd-member-nations-rose-2012-led-netherlands-poland-slovak-1151019) &gt;So your assertion that Americans are lazy, greedy and selfish just sounds like more corporatist talking points. Um...where did you get that? A corporatist wouldnt be saying that taxes need to increase. A corporatist would be saying taxes should be lowered. I think you need to understand the definition of a term before you start throwing it around. &gt;Your Americans-are-bad propaganda just reeks of stuff you picked up from TV. TV owned by the corporations. What? You are delusional. &gt;And the corporate solution? Keep corporate taxes at almost zero, and raise taxes on the already-dying American Middle Class. You might want to do some research on corporate taxation. Increasing corporate taxes hurts the middle class. That is why nearly all economists, even left-leaning ones and Keynesians, support a lower corporate tax rate. [These taxes just get passed on to the consumers and workers.](http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Tax-VOX/2012/0913/Do-corporate-tax-breaks-benefit-the-middle-class)"
"Historically most of Europe has had revolutions or purges where the wealthy are drug out into the streets and shot, beheaded, hung, drawn and quartered. The last purge in Europe was around WWII. Such a purge has not happened in the U.S. When the statement it cant happen here is said I dont think of totolitarian police States or ethnic cleansing not being able to happen here; I think of power and wealth.purges not being able to happen. "
"Actually, what you said wasnt true. The Middle Class DOES spend as much as Northern Europeans in taxes. Youre thinking only in terms of FEDERAL income taxes and not calculating in state and local taxes. When you add BOTH federal *and* state taxes, the average American pays about as much as a Swede. Yet gets almost none of the same services that the Swede does. Well, then where is the money going? Answer: Military spending, and pork that ends up going to corporations like Walmart. (Go Google how much tax money Walmart gets from average citizens, through their lobbyists and bought politicians). So your assertion that Americans are lazy, greedy and selfish just sounds like more corporatist talking points. And the corporate solution? Keep corporate taxes at almost zero, and raise taxes on the already-dying American Middle Class. Good job spreading their disinformation!!! Let me guess your solution: 1) Keep corporate taxes at historical lows, 2) Raise taxation on the already-strangled Middle Class in one of the deepest recessions in US history, 3) Cut services and social security benefits to said Middle Class. I think youre a proponent of the Mr. Burns plan from the Simpsons."
Lefty here. More than happy to pay for it.
Yeah the line that stood out in OPs comic was YOUR OWN PEOPLE - I suspect many Americans dont think of their neighbours this way..
"Despite my admiration for the lifestyles afforded to Nordic countries, Id be glad to fork over &gt;40% of my income for that same quality of life. Unfortunately, every time I hear about a politician lining his pockets and not doing his/her job, paying such high taxes seems futile. I often ask myself if what we pay would be enough, if only there werent so many people funneling it away on ridiculous projects or into their own accounts. Then consider the people driving our lawmakers to enforce or strike down policies (in short, big business), which have repeatedly proven to not have the best interests of our people at heart. The icing on the cake is the part of our country which, because of big business influence, have been convinced that providing any additional government benefits would be detrimental to our societys drive to persevere, cry socialism, or say its wasteful when its really just going to cut into someones exorbitant profits. In short, there are too many corrupt politicians, counterintuitive policies and stupid assholes for it to work. Maybe some day well get our shit together."
"The new spirit of the age: Gaining wealth, forgetting all but self is the hard-driven ideology of capitalists. Ive got mine, so why should I care about anyone else? I dont agree with it, but thats the mindset in the USA. Rampant hypocrisy is a big problem too. Again, Ive got my handout and who cares about everyone else? Corporate propaganda is a huge driver because corporations need mindless consumers in order to stay rich."
"Tax codes, thanks. We have record profits by companies who dont give their fair share back. Its not about taxing the rich to be vindictive, but about not letting those at the top take everything. The bigger they get, the worse our country will be. Their buying power means absurd political influence that middle class people cannot compete with without ridiculous organization, which seems basically impossible considering our culture looks at unions with disgust."
"&gt; Well, lets be completely honest. Americans, as taxpayers, are selfish as fuck. People on the right want to pay as little taxes as possible, and people on the left want way more than what they are willing to pay for. Basically, we want to be a European-style social democracy, but we dont want to have to pay for it. Consider our government healthcare spending ([e.g.,](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/23/chart_us_government_spends_more_on_health_care_than_the_canadian_government.html)). Our government spends more than enough to provide a European style universal healthcare system, but we have our awful system that leaves tens of millions of us without access to healthcare. What can we draw from this fact? At very least, Americans have little problem with immense wasteful spending for programs they support (i.e., medicare). If Americans were stingy and cheap, Why would the government be forbidden from bargaining for prescription drug [prices](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/tammy-baldwin/uncle-sam-barred-bargaining-medicare-drug-prices-s/)? Maybe we simply dont have a government that responds to popular will."
"Eh...sort of. Clinton only signed minor tax increases (3% increase on top earners, and 1% increase on payroll tax), but he also cut the capital gains tax by nearly a third (not a terrible policy), and eliminated numerous tariffs. Considering what people are now starting to ask for from our government, the rates under Clinton would still likely be too low. Go look at what a middle class person in Germany or France is paying in taxes compared to what a middle class person in the United States pays. We pay very little, but expect a lot."
Pretty spot on. We have a populous who doesnt want to be taxes. The rich dont want to be taxes and the poor want anyone but themselves to be taxed.
"Well, lets be completely honest. Americans, as taxpayers, are selfish as fuck. People on the right want to pay as little taxes as possible, and people on the left want way more than what they are willing to pay for. Basically, we want to be a European-style social democracy, but we dont want to have to pay for it. Until we figure that out, we are going to continue to be in this mess. We cant just tax the rich our way to prosperity. All of us are going to have to do our part if we want these services. Our middle class pays very little in taxes compared to much of Europe, yet we feel that it is ridiculous that we dont have similar services. We need to stop being so childish as a nation. A social democracy isnt taxing the rich to pay for the rest of the people, it is everyone doing their part. When both parties take a hard-lined stance on not letting temporary tax breaks expire, you know that it is going to be difficult to pay for the services we demand. We need to figure it out sooner rather than later: are we going to be a low-tax, low-service nation, or are we going to increase our taxes to a reasonable level to pay for the services we demand?"
"you nailed it. Americans are childish in the extreme when it comes to taxation and the greater good. Endless money for wars and prisons, no money for healthcare and education. "
"I disagree thats the issue at hand. I think people are ignorant and short-sighted. If they were TRULY selfish they would *want* these things as everyone, including themselves, would benefit, resulting in a better society which they are a part of. But Americans are short-sighted and know not how to foresee long-term benefits. Its all short-term gains and cheap thrills, not investment and cultivating a future. I think lack of proper critical thinking skills developing through, ahem, **education** is what is lacking and causing this. Unfortunately they refuse to provide said education, so a viscous cycle of ignorance is propagated. Our culture even goes so far as to villainize educated citizens as elitist."
"&gt;People on the right want to pay as little taxes as possible, and people on the left want way more than what they are willing to pay for. And thats the issue, we no longer have a debate where people come together and realize that these two polar ideas *cant* exist together. Instead, we have a government that tries to *make* them exist together. Worse than that, weve framed the argument that only polar opposite ideas are valid, and each side just makes the other worse. And the bureaucratic system in DC continues to sludge along not accomplishing anything, feeding the people who perpetuate the system because it feeds them. They wont do the right thing, because they live for the argument which helps divide the population, which keeps them in office living the high life. Weve gone back to the days of the Roman Senate in the days of the decline of their empire. Rich pieces of shit living off the fat of the citizens theyre supposed to represent, ignorant or indifferent to the plight of anyone who isnt politically convenient for them."
"The problem is Americans are stupid as fuck. If they were selfish, and smart, wed pass higher min. wage, max wage laws, tax the rich, and pass better social programs. But Americans are too dumb to understand that all of that is in their own self interest. "
"&gt; yet we feel that it is ridiculous that we dont have similar services Only some of us feel this way, not all of us. &gt;&gt;We need to figure it out sooner rather than later: are we going to be a low-tax, low-service nation, or are we going to increase our taxes to a reasonable level to pay for the services we demand? Until there is a way to make everyone pay something and not have 50% pay nothing, things will never change. "
"What do you call the sequester? Bail-outs were loans that actually made money for the government. Stimulus is widely recognized by economists as the way out of a recession, and increasing debt is meaningless if you dont compare it to percentage of GDP, which is pretty much staying equal. "

"That money is not a gift to the insurance companies. The companies are limited to a gross profit of 15 or 20%, a significant part of which will necessarily be paid out in expenses, including wages for their employees. The 80-85% goes to the health care industry as payment for services rendered to the public. The subsidies are benefiting the public, which desires healthcare. Under the ACA, private insurance companies really dont help anything and do add costs overall. But the actual profit to the insurance companies is a very small part of overall spending. "
Are you so deluded that the entire world boils down to what Republicans say and what Democrats say? Thats really the extent that you can image political discourse ranging? 
"http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/16441/unite_here_chief_blasts_obama_over_aca Most of the ACA?s $965 billion in subsidies will go directly to commercial insurance companies, one of the largest transfers of public wealth to private hands ever. "

Actually, that is what the administration predicts according to the documents linked. So far, the ACA is going down in flames. It is getting nothing but bad press.

"If you like your plan, you can keep it. Period."
"&gt; Millions lose insurance plans they were promised they could keep by Obama NBC[2] Millions lose insurance plans that dont meet basic minimums that were signed into federal law more than three years ago.

Yeah, the rollout has been shit. Shit is getting fixed, but Republican bad faith attacks and sabotage continue. "
"&gt; Obama lied when he said you could keep your insurance. Ultimately what it boils down to is that I dont give a shit. This is a level of not-give-a-shit thatd even carry through the Bush administration. Its too bad that some people are being forced to change their insurance plans. I also think its too bad that those are the kinds of people who would have gone bankrupt if they had a major medical emergency. At the end of the day I wouldnt lose any sleep over seeing those bad plans destroyed. There are things worth getting worked up over, *and this just is not one of them.* &gt; The total contract value of this website that only managed to sign up less than 300 people nationwide the first two days was $292 Million That is worth getting upset over, and I am upset over it. I think it is a fucking embarrassment and the contractor responsible needs to be slapped for it. On the other hand, was the site capacity planning shat all over because of the larger-than-planned amount of states that refused to do any work on their own exchanges? I dunno - well see. States that run their own exchanges arent running into the same level of problems. Folks who live in states that refused to build an exchange should ruminate on that for a minute before being upset that the Federal government isnt doing a perfect job at what was supposed to be the job of their state. &gt; They moved ahead with a bad product. The exchange launch date was federal law. &gt; They need to get 39,000 people a day on the federal exchange to sign up to meet their 7 million goal by March 1st. Give it time. Enrollment will creep up as deadlines approach. &gt; The administration still wont release numbers for the federal exchange which doesnt bode well. The month of October *just ended*. Give it a little bit of time. &gt; Meanwhile 90% of the state exchanges have people enrolling in medicaid which is the exact opposite the plan needs to work. Well see what happens as time goes on. Those folks have health coverage now. Im not gonna get upset over people being helped. &gt; Do you honestly think that if the situation was reversed that the Democrats would not revel in the Republicans plan blowing up in their face? Rather than navelgaze, let us look back in time all the way back to the beforetime where stuff happened *before* President Obama was elected. Or as normal people call it, 2006. http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/27/1251035/-Remember-the-Medicare-D-Rollout-Glitches-Neither-does-GOP Did Democrats try to sabotage the law? Did they say it was gonna kill grandma? Did they shut down the government to stop it? Did they hold hearings demanding Republicans resign? Did Democrats refuse to help their constituents navigate the new law? Fuck no. Because thats childish. Perhaps I am unaware of Democratic sabotage. Care to share? &gt; Yet, this week millions of people lost their insurance and are facing sticker shock to the new prices. It isnt like I have no empathy but Ive read a few too many of these to take such things seriously right now: http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-debunked-20131030,0,6010994.story But lets take it at face value. A few million people are going to lose their shit health insurance. Where are the insurance companies in the debate? They knew for years now. Why were they still selling substandard plans? Of those millions of people, how many of them are going to end up paying more when you take Medicaid expansions into account? Well, Medicaid expansions *assuming your state didnt refuse the expansion*. Or subsidies in general. I am having difficulty fully engaging my care-clutch when the primary source of this noise is from people who have a vested interest in making sure the ACA implementation fails as loudly as possible. &gt; Forbes predicts that 93 million will lose their insurance plans once the employer mandate kicks in. Insurances companies have been cancelling plans and arbitrarily increasing rates for literally decades now. The ACA puts down some pretty basic minimums: * https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/essential-health-benefits/ &gt; Essential health benefits must include items and services within at least the following 10 categories: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care. None of that strikes me as unreasonable. When THIS MANY PEOPLE are going to lose coverage it just supports every study that shows how tens of millions of Americans are underinsured for their basic needs. &gt; It is getting nothing but bad press. Thank you, right wing noise machine. Im more interested in how things perform months from now. "
So I guess any amount of voter suppression is OK by you then.

They are.
"Where do you think ER costs for uninsured folks comes from, if not state budgets? Penny wise, pound foolish."
Emergency room costs count for around 2% of medical costs. Even high estimates put it single digit territory. This has always been a red herring. The Kaiser source at the bottom of my post only estimates 18% savings on this emergency care. Thats 18% of 2% and only if all states expand. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/28/nick-gillespie/does-emergency-care-account-just-2-percent-all-hea/ According to these figures in all 50 states combined its just 47.3 billion for all emergency costs. Not all of this is uncompensated either. You cant just call all emergency room costs waste. According to Kaiser if all the states expanded Medicaid it would cost 76 billion making the expansion as expensive as emergency care for the whole country and only saves around 18 billion. http://kff.org/medicaid/press-release/report-finds-state-costs-of-implementing-the/ 
"ER costs arent the only one, just the most straight forward. You might want to look at this: http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3801 Even taking *everything you have said* at face value as 100% truth, the difference ends up being something like what, 50 billion a year? Across the entire nation? I have **great personal difficulty** in imagining that to being an insurmountable burden for states. Texas, for example, has something around 7 million folks that would get coverage if Medicaid was expanded. Further, if they *dont* accept Medicaid expansion money those states are fucked anyway due to a 2% reduced provider payment cut. A hole is being blown in their budgets either way, but I guess they are enjoying the freedom to make the wrong decision."

"Ugh, the comments here. Its not like having food stamps magically makes it possible to live off the government. My SO and I both work and still qualify for food stamps, and we still run out and spend cash on food too. Having food stamps helps, but it doesnt pay for all of your food. Or any of the bills, for that matter. Edit: and before anyone says that we spend cash on food because they give us the right amount of food stamps to supplement our income, we do still run out of food and go hungry at times."
"We care about the percentage of people in poverty and not the number. If five people are unemployed, there is not an apparent risk to social mobility, state, local, regional, or national economies. If you tell me that five people is 66% of the population, then the matter becomes pressing. A record number of Americans DOES NOT EQUAL a record percentage of Americans. We could have had 60 million Americans with a population of 300; 20 percent would be in poverty. Then, ten years later we could have 61 million Americans in poverty and have a population of 325 million; 18.46 percent would be in poverty. I just wanted to point out how deceptive the title is. "
Then cut the fucking military and agribusiness democrats!

Republicans did not win anything. What do you think the starving people are just going to sit in the corner quietly? The entire system needs a massive overhaul and it wont happen until enough people get fed up. The republicans are doing the country a favor by acting like shitheads.
"Alright, Dems. Its time to raise the minimum wage to something people can actually live on. Use these cuts as a negotiation tool. If the GOP doesnt want to spend so much on handouts, they should be fine with forcing companies to pay their employees a living wage."
Countdown for the 99% 2.0 initiated. National poverty rate 21.8% and rising.
What really disgusts me is how they talk about a GOP win or a lose for the Dems as though theyre just competing for some screwed up kind of political gamerscore. The ones who win and lose are the hundreds of thousands of people affected by the decisions you make.
Welfare fraud is like voter fraud. Very small but makes good headlines.
"That is $9 Billion over ten years and works out to about 1% of the total food stamp spending. I certainly dont think we should be cutting food stamps at all, but this is hardly a major win for republicans. The sky is not always falling. "
"Republicans won? The [House plan was to cut $40b](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/us/politics/house-passes-bill-cutting-40-billion-from-food-stamps.html), [the Senate plan](http://www.thenation.com/blog/177495/while-obama-talks-poverty-stabenow-agrees-8-billion-more-snap-cuts) went from $6b to the current $9b. The Senate plan (Democrat majority) passes, Republicans win?"
I just assume their plan is to starve out unemployment. 
But dont cut the 700 billion in military spending plus X billions in wartime flex spending.
"I love being an American where Im made to feel my vote has little to no consequence and the lawmakers of the country are completely out of touch with the people they impose said laws upon. But hey, guns and stuff."
Finally!!! I have a really hard time sleeping knowing that were feeding the poor and in need. Its like Jesus said: let the poor starve.
Nothing sets off a crowd with torches and pitchforks like watching their kids get hungry. Theres a reason that the Roman emperors gave out free bread.
"read the article. The cuts to the food stamp program come from closing a loophole that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed needed to be addressed. A households level of monthly food stamps benefits is determined by how much disposable income a family has after rent, utilities, and other expenses are deducted. Some states allow beneficiaries to deduct a standard utility charge from their income if they qualify for a federal heating aid program called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), even if they only receive a few dollars per year in heating aid. The arrangement results in about 850,000 households getting a utility deduction that is much larger than their actual utility bill. Because the deduction makes these families disposable income appear to be lower than it actually is, they get more food stamp money each month. The farm bill that passed the House on Wednesday saves $9 billion by closing that loophole. if anything, this is GOOD. people should be treated fairly - all people. this loophole artificially allowed some to take more than others, which i dont think anyone wants to happen. not al money spent on foodstamps is good investment, the same way not all money spent on defence is a good investment. eventually, government needs to decrease in size, not increase."
"So in MA, I work for a minimum wage and barely have money for food at the end of the month. I applied for SNAP and now receive 189$ THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN EAT. How much are my food benefits going to drop I dont want to wind up going hungry"
"I understand the need for food stamps, hell they are a great program. However, as someone living in a small town where about half the population is on food stamps, its very frustrating. Every time I go to the store I see some woman with tons of kids using food stamps to buy diapers and formula while spending her own money on booze and cigarettes. Fucking quit your a use problems and maybe you could afford all 23 kids you decided to have. "
Correction: 8 billion over the next *decade*. Big whoop.
So much easier to blame Republicans and not all the Dems who vote for it and Obama who will sign it. Unfortunately the world is not as black and white as motherjones wants you to believe. 
"Just remember kids, its not socialism if its for a farmer or a soldier."

With the budget only being $86.5 billion a year this is a significant cut. Its insane to think that $40 billion was the original proposed amount.
A record number of Americans are living in poverty *because* of the failed economic policies of Obama and his handlers.
Let them. The Republican party keeps digging their own grave deeper and deeper.
Some war. The only casualties are among those who werent on either side.
"Lets hope they get the service they deserve from all the low wage people they deal with at the airport, in restaurants, etc."
"The republicans got a compromise. They wanted $40 billion, the democrats wanted $0. $9 billion wasnt even meeting in the middle. If congress cannot compromise well get nowhere. It shouldnt be a they won/we won thing, it should just be the country as a whole moving forward. I dont personally agree that food stamps needed any cuts, the poor are having tough times as it is, but the dems dont have a supermajority right now so theyre going to have to compromise to get anything past the House of Representatives."
"Food stamps are a plot by Big Agriculture. They use poor people as their excuse, but once all of that food is consumed and defecated, end of the day the money flows to Big Ag, so its just another corporate subsidy."
Some people fail to understand the difference between a battle and a war.
"Screw you, poors. - Sincerely, the 113th United States Congress"
And all the while the Democrats call the Republicans obstructionists. This is called the compromise that they say they have demanded for years now. So are the Democrats actually wanting compromise? The simple answer friends is - -apparently not! Republicans didnt get the spending cuts they wanted and that 9 billion in food stamp cuts is over a 10 year period. (A rounding error in a more than a 1 trillion dollar budget) Members of both parties warned that further cuts to the military would hollow out the military and cost U.S. jobs.
"Finally those lazy bums can get the jobs that dont exist. Maybe they can eliminate the minimum wage, so they can all have hobo fights over a nickel a day. Next up: Suicide booths."
When is the last time someone in this country (Most overweight in the world by the way) actually died of starvation?
Causing poverty in America has been n absolute conspiracy.
This is just asinine! While congress critters exchange rhetoric over how to define things like the the [working poor](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/01/26/working-poor-now-majority-of-food-stamp-recipients-with-college-educated-among-fastest-growing-group-of-users/) are getting screwed! How is problem so misunderstood is beyond me.
and they will blame poor people not getting food on Obama in 4..3..2..
"If you give someone free food, housing, medical, phones,etc., why would they ever try to get off the free stuff? Im asking as a real question, mainly because you see people that are 3rd generation draw recipients and they have been taught to live like this. Using food stamps to buy sodas to resell for cash $.30 on the dollar, being obese, and watching TV all day in a trailer. How does it help them in the long run? Or a better question might be, what else could we (govt) do that would be better. "
Now there will be an epidemic of cannibalism just like in North Korea. [Miami cannibal attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_cannibal_attack)
We wouldnt need the food stamps if there wasnt so much income inequality!
"...and weve just moved one step closer to the probability of a Revolution in the U.S. Clearly, this country needs to eject some of the corporate shills in the Senate too. If its an example of winning, its Charlie-Sheen-meltdown-style winning."
"I just dont believe hand-outs serve as any real anti-poverty measure. We started in the great society in the 60s but poverty rates apparently growing? It seems education and mental illness are the real problems, not starving people."
"Hey, if the poor cant eat, then they starve to death, if they die, then we have less poor. This would solve the poverty crisis by eliminating the poor!"
God forbid the welfare class are forced to stop stuffing taxpayer-funded fried chicken into their swollen cheeks long enough to even consider the prospect of earning a living.
These cuts really need to come from the red (taker) states. No reason that those who live in states that provide this money should suffer.
Good luck telling your armed security forces to fight against the millions of poor when revolution occurs. 
"So they are against the minimum wage, yet they want to cut food stamps. I guess you cant win the Republican world. The government cant help you, and the private sector doesnt have to pay you. "
Democracy is about working *with* the opposition to create solutions for the public they serve; not holding hostage the good of the public with polemics.
honest question. why doesnt obama veto the measure? it seems like every other day i heard about bush vetoing things that came to him. since obama doesnt have to run for reelection what does he have to lose in vetoing it if he actually thinks its a bad policy
Nobody is going to starve because of this. The program never reached those people before this. 
"Good, cuts need to be made somewhere and thats the place to do it. I dont have an issue helping people in need but the problem with programs like food stamps is people taking advantage of the system. I used to work at a grocery store and youd be surprised and what people try to pull as well as what class of people use them. I had many middle class customers pull out an EBT card, people who dont need it."
Then they blame Obama. Sigh...
MURRIKA!
"So I guess were only 2 missed meals from revolution, now?"
good. maybe you should have made better life choices so you dont end up on food stamps in the first place. you shouldnt be rewarded for popping out babies without a good career or plan in mind to support yourself or children.
"For the many this will affect, I am deeply sorry for; however, those few who voted for these Republican and receive food stamps, I can only hope that their hunger serves to enlighten them. "
So... whens the riots?
"Looks like they want to get shot by a revolutionary. Wouldnt be the worst thing to happen to the US. Alas, its only the province of apocalyptic fiction. "
Well its a good thing my wife and I just had our first baby while both 21 years old and in college. Thanks congress! I knew since Ive been working and paying taxes since the age of thirteen I could count on you! 
Remember Pro-Birth not Pro-Life.

Thankfully war spending and funds for business grants as well as tax cuts remain largely untouched. Go go conservative spending!
"When there is truly nothing left, the poor will have nothing left to eat but the rich. "
"One great lesson of history is that you can do pretty much anything you want as a government so long as you keep the people fed. Well-fed people tend not to risk life and limb in revolution no matter how ridiculous the rest of the system becomes. Another great lesson of history is that the power elite just cant seem to help themselves... they ought to know all they have to do is feed people (not even expensive in this day and age) and they can get away with anything. And yet, inevitably, time and again through history, they somehow forget this simple point and, well... plenty of examples on how that turns out for them."
"Whatever war you guys are fighting, it is not working. War on drugs = more drugs, war on terror = more terror. War on poverty = more poverty. You cannot reach any of these goals with force. Does anyone honstly think an official office with the assignment to end poverty will END poverty? they all would loose their jobs. They are interested in extending their programs, increase their own saleries and not end their apointment. "
Why are Republicans still in office and whatnot if so many Americans think theyre dumb as bricks?
"We tried food stamps, they clearly did not work. Its time for a change, end of discussion. "
Fuck yeah! Let the great die off begin. This is awesome news.If we cant have a eugenics program this is better than nothing.
There is not winner in a food stamp program which has doubled in the 5 years Obama has been president. The cuts to the program amount to 1%. Insignificant.
"I live off of Food Stamps, and even I think its a program thats nice, but ought to be downsized drastically. The less taxes I have to pay, the more money I have to spend thats actually **MINE**."
The fact is that no one has the right to force another man to pay for his life. Welfare steals my money and gives it to people who wont work for it. People arent entitled to my fruits.
"Im gunna keep re-reading the title, using different punctuation each time, until it makes sense to me. "
To be honest after working in a supermarket seeing how many people abuse the fuck out of the foodstamp program I really dont feel bad at all. 
"Edit: removed the post because I dont like debating, sorry "
This story is complete BS. I watched the SOTU address last night and the economy is fine.
"Its sad really, the rich get richer and the poor get even more poor. "
the people on food stamps should of worn protection when they could barely afford food for themselves. Same thing for welfare.
Thou shalt taketh from the takers until they cannot take it any more.
hard to feel sorry for people using foodstamps when they just keep having more and more kids while constantly buying non-essential items their sense of entitlement really is off putting
Good. Maybe these broke moochers will actually try to find a job
Can we please protest now? How much longer do we have to be tormented by idiots governing the country? Or the states? Then again the country is filled with idiots who willingly believe the shit that is spewed on TV with nary a thought to look in to these matters to educate themselves before speaking. Bubbas every-fucking-where.
time to start the vote them both out campaign 
"I deliver mail and ACTUALLY see these people, and they have every right to cut funds! Its been horrribly abused... How about everyone do some field research instead of pontificating what would be nice for people!!! Its annoying as shit "
Too bad no one will do anything about it.
Ive seen a woman buy food at walmart using food stamps and then hop into her new F150 Pick up and drive off. Some people are abusing the system. 
"I wonder if shoplifting will increase in grocery stores? No Im not saying the poor are inherently thieves, Im saying that being hunger will make people do things they never thought they would, i.e. shoplifting. "
"You could say democrats won by getting them to lower what the Republicans wanted to cut initially by a lot. Such a biased headline... Both parties wanted cuts just one wanted a lot more than the other. I would say it is a pretty good compromise, however I dont agree that there should of been any cuts."
Im ok with people not being able to buy cigarettes and lottery tickets. No reason why someone on food stamps should be eating lobster when I cant afford lobster and Im not on food stamps. 
Thats Awesome!!!! One more step to food riots and the eventually reinstatement of the Constitution!!!! Thank you Republicans for setting America one more step down the path to a bloody civil war.
"Oh dont worry, the poor will still either stay home or vote Republican next November. "
Oh SNAP!
"Rice is cheap and high in carbs. Just because u cant afford to eat what u want, doesnt mean u cant afford to eat"
 Well you cant expect all brown people to kill themselves. The war machine needs money to run
Why has no-one raised the issue of food stamps themselves? Forcing people to fulfill their basic human needs by using special (i.e. non-standard) tokens seems to be pretty degrading to me. Kind of strengthens the otherness of the poor to my mind.
Both the Senate and President Barack Obama are expected to approve the legislation. I BLAME BUSH!!!!!!
More money for war
"wait, cant the senate stop it?"
"Could be worse: House Republicans drafted new legislation slashing $40 billion from the food stamp program. That bill passed the House with Republican votes only. After months of negotiations with the Democrat-controlled Senate, which wanted much lower cuts of around $4 billion, the House finally passed a farm bill 251-166 Wednesday that contains a compromise $9 billion in reductions to the food stamp program."
Raised poor and now I upper middle. Most people on welfare are on it because they can be. With no motivation to lift themselves up they will continue to subsist on assistance simply because they can.
"The Grand Old Patricians understand debt and money about as well as the know-nothings understood immigration. They know in a macroeconomic sense, fuck-all. "
Won?
It must be because republicans want to make people starve!
I still dont understand how legislation can affect so many things with just one bill. Its counter-intuitive and counterproductive.
What Id like to see is this extended to childrens lunch programs- like we need to keep giving children handouts. Let those fuckers get jobs like the children who made their clothes. Next up: I unveil my Poor Tax and expansion of prison labor.
"We live in relative poverty in America, which Id really just pretend poverty especially when compared too other countries"
Seriously fuck my country...

"i think its important to note something here. When ever there is not enough bread and circus to appease the unwashed masses, they tend to get rather.... um how should i say... *feisty.*"
USA! USA! USA!
"And why are so many people living in poverty? 3 words: Barack Hussein Obama. More entitlements have been handed out under his rule than at any other time in US history. More people on food stamps than at any other time in history. And the Democrats only want to hand out more and more and more so that people will be more reliant on government. Why would you want to vote Santa Claus out of office? The leeches and the parasites have their collective hands out saying, Gimme more! Its disgusting."
You all should do a little research on who gives more to charities and the poor. Let me help you out.. It isnt Democrats. 
"I am a mental health worker that facilitates client access to foodstamps and Medicaid. If Im out in the community with them, I help my clients use their EBT cards to purchase food/drink. I have seen foodstamps help these individuals... but I am also acutely aware of abuses of the program... I have facilitated some of these abuses under the direction of my psychologist boss. AMA."
And the liberal circle jerk that is /r/politics keeps on a-rollin.
"Shields, helmets, riots. Or quit complaining."
This will get down voted but this will impact me because now less people will be willing to sell their extra food stamps at a 50% rate 
Yay!!! fuck the poor.... that **IS** the GOP/right-wing message made clear.... less food = less poor people.
"Get ready for the personal experience evidence- I worked at Walmart as a cashier for a couple summers in college. Middle class to poor city, so lots of food stamps came through my line. That experience changed a lot of my outlook on government aid. About 80% of the money spent was on things my own hardworking family didnt even buy because it wasnt cost effective- Im talking name brand cereal, STEAKS, cases of not-generic sodas, etc. I learned then that people will very freely spend money that is not theirs. In my experience- which since then has been AMPLE due to my current job- there is a wave of entitlement that is spreading like a virus. It frustrates me to no end, and it gives hardworking people that really DO need a little help a bad rap. Ive personally seen hundreds of thousands of dollars just handed out like Halloween candy to people who turn around and complain because as a country were still not doing enough and are only in it for the money. I think charity is an essential part of a moral society. But this shit is getting ridiculous. "
"But, I mean, this is good, right? Now all the poor people who just needed motivation to go out and find a job will find themselves in a wonderland of opportunity! The rich and affluent run a ton of multimillion-dollar companies that have piles of jobs available for these people! I mean, sure: Many of the jobs available dont pay enough to survive, forcing the people working them into social assistance programs that are now having their funding cut, but that just serves to motivate people to take jobs that dont pay enough to survive, so theyre forced to rely on social assistance programs that are now having their funding cut ... Huh. I wonder if the people responsible for this shit see this vicious cycle from their lofty perches atop their ivory towers?"
This title is biased.... The poor should go get jobs then
"This is a 1% cut to a program that had doubled since like 2008, dont make it a bigger deal than it is. Even dems wanted some cuts. "
Outstandingly good news!
Keep telling yourself that Republicans won this and Democrats won that. 
A 1% symbolic cut... oh the fucking horror. Next.
Isnt this closing a loophole and will only be cutting the program by 1% over ten years?
Starvation might actually nudge the impoverished masses into action. 
Do you guys honestly think food stamps are so great? We need to create public sector jobs.
"I absolutely believe that cuts need to be made to this program, as I have also seen it abused first hand. I went to a high school where I was considered rich just because my family wasnt on any government assistance, even though we were barely middle class. The people I saw on a daily basis would wear *thousands* of dollars worth of designer clothing, start having children at age 12 (literally went to middle school with pregnant girls....), drop out at 16, and live off of government assistance for the rest of their lives because no one was going to stop them. I have no problem helping others that need it who are actually trying to improve their lives and just are having bad luck, but the widespread abuse needs to stop. I think Congress should try to set some of that money aside to investigate people that are on these programs, and enact stricter rules about being on them (i.e. time limits....if you are unemployed and arent actively trying to find a job or go to school when on benefits, then they get cut). "
"The strange thing is, I was getting food stamps while Bush was still in office. While he was in, food stamp benefits just kept going up and up. To the point where they were giving us crazy amounts per month. More than Id spend even if I had a good paying job and no problem buying my own food. And this was while I DID have a job, so it was just supplementary because minimum wage is too low, I guess. Its done nothing but go down ever since, from what Ive heard. Everything about the GOP is nuts, this just confirms it."
I hope this drop in the bucket really does something. I really do. Because I dont want to have to see the Democrats stand before a starving America saying we told you so. Id rather we the Democrats lose the argument and the Republicans be right than be right this time.
Wow
" I agree that there needs to be a program like food stamps, but the current system is not working. I am not saying this stuff about the people who actually need it. I heard this quote at the grocery store yesterday, Hold on I have to go get my food stamp card because all I have is cash. It was sickening. Or how about the people who get cash on their food stamps and then they take cash off of their food stamp card to buy beer and cigarettes. Another example, I saw a lady who had a food stamp card from two different states. If you think this is a good system then you are blind. I dont think it is right that people have to pay for other peoples mistakes. I think it should be as hard to get food stamps as it is disability. It should take months for someone to get approved for food stamps and that should only be after it is proven that they would starve to death without them. Then the should be drug tested and it should only be for a certain amount of time. "
"Its a ~10% reduction to a program that has tripled in cost in the last 6-7 years. The program SHOULD rise and fall with the economy. The Democrats are all giddy about how great the economy is doing, so why are there still so many people that need food stamps? Hmm."
At least one party is willing to make cuts.
"Yep, piss off the poor, young people. Always worked out in the past right?"
"Its a pretty short sited idea. The fact of the matter is that like it or not, nutrition is tied to public health. Malnourished people will cost out government money now that weve increased our healthcare spending. The last thing this nation needs is more people in the hospital and cutting the food stamp program will assuredly accomplish that. No policy if perfect and Id be lying if I said I thought food stamps were the exception to that rule. Despite its imperfections, its a legitimate program aimed at combating the bitter reality that poverty creates for so many people. Its funny that the constitution mentions protecting the general welfare of our nation. Programs like this are created through that motivation and there are hundreds of other problems with our nations domestic and foreign policy making that could be reformed to save 9 billion dollars."
take a good look at the face of evil.
Good. Maybe use that money to teach responsible spending and basic econ. I cant tell you the number of times I have witnessed people using stamps and link cards and then whipping out a $20 for mountain dew and cigarettes. Maybe if they werent abusing the system so hard it wouldnt be in such bad shape
"Congress has two institutions. if this passes the senate and is signed by the Holy One I think you better start spreading the blame around. this is how you get fooled, you blame one party while the other fucks you and asks for votes. Just because one party didnt have as many votes doesnt mean they didnt have any and are free from blame. Here is a key phrase for those of you without any objectivity: **Both the Senate and President Barack Obama are expected to approve the legislation.** and this president just got up in front of all of us and said quite the fucking opposite. The difference in this done deal is that the democrats wanted to cut it by $5 billion. Read that again and again you dolts... The democrats wanted to cut SNAP as well."
"I guess the poor will have to start eating Republicans, then."
Yes run to the polls on the way to mc donalds and vote republican.
"Not for nothing but if I was poor and relying on food stamps and these guys had a town hall, Id show up waving my W sticker and Merka Flag and proceed directly to my 2nd Amendment Remedy. The GOP is a Clear &amp; Present Danger to the MAJORITY of Americans. "
ITT: People who have taken a single basic Economics course (if that) talking about issues way way above their heads.
"Its kind of like banning porn, which increases population because people need to release that sex."
"Why does mother jones never publish concise articles? Everything with them is so long... its very pseudo-intellectual. This one isnt bad, but it seems like a short one for them."
"Its so terrible. I think the right are the true domestic evil. How can they justify taking from those who need it most then give tax cuts to those who are extremely wealthy? In a first world country, all people should be paid a wage they can live off and be able to get the healthcare they need. "
"To improve the economy you gotta cut something, so no matter what they cut people will complain. Its either this, or education, or welfare, or transportation, etc. Pick your poison. I do wish they would cut military spending though."
The tone of this headline is rather opinionated. I think theres good and bad to this. The debate should be riveting. 
But O said the economy was thriving last night. Why are so many on food stamps if the economy is doing so well?
"hey, the economy is sure to get better now with out all those people looking for a handout sucking on the tit."
Fuckin assholes. Seriously if you make less than six figures and vote R youre plain and simple fucking stupid.
"The Republicans are committed to turning America into a feudal system where the vast majority of Americans are essentially slaves completely dependent on their employers. They shut down schools and gut the education system so only the rich have the opportunity to get good jobs. They want people to be dependent on their employers for health insurance. They want to get rid of unions and the minimum wage. They want wages to be so low that people cant even miss a few days pay, so workers will be afraid to complain when theyre mistreated or underpaid. They want unemployment to be so high that any employee is instantly replaceable. And theyre getting exactly what they want. This is the path America is on right now. "
Lets make the republicans count the dead bodies of the children who starve to death because of this!
I feel bad for the people who have no choice but to be on food stamps but not for the ignorant people who live to live off of food stamps and wic checks. Let them and their children rot in the streets
"Im not siding with either, but why is it so okay to bash Republicans on Reddit, but if you so as mention a Democrat being wrong, HOLY SHIT, YOU MUST HATE THE LOWER CLASS!. The problem I have with food stamps is that people can buy the most ridiculous things with them. Like candy, for example. Candy is not a need. You should buy desires such as that when you have excess money to spend, not with taxpayers dollars."
[This seems so familiar.](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch28.htm)
"Its easy to tell people you are going to give them free food, and make them healthy, and give them all raises. But my opinion is that the government legislating ways companies to be fair is the wrong way to do it. We are subsidizing the poorest with food, off work pay, minimum hourly pay, healthcare and much more. I dont think that this stimulates anyone to grow. It is my opinion that it stagnates classes rather than creates safety nets. When Im working class and benifits appear, my cost of living goes up, and my company benifits disappear. It keeps happening."
They are really risking a Storming of the Bastille. Hungry people do desperate things.
"Hold up, Usually when a plan is passed, it benefits a certain group. How does this benefit anyone? Obviously its terrible for those in Poverty, but why did the GOP want to slash it? What were their motives!?"
nothing will be done by anyone.
"Nearly any cut is a good cut, in my book. Also, this is a Mother Jones article, which means its ridiculously biased to begin with. Mother Jones is simply a propaganda machine, nothing more. When NPR or The Economist writes a *real* news story on this issue, let me know."
I guarantee that 90% of the butthurt people commenting have never been poor.
What did you think they would do? They want to kill you all so you cant vote. 
"Truly disheartening for the millions of Americans who depend on this program. Unbelievable that Congress would be willing to leave their lower class hungry. The gap just keeps getting wider, this is unacceptable "
Because the democrats dont give a shot about the poor either. People need to wake up to the fact that politicians dont give a shit about anybody except supporting the capitalist pillars that support them and keep them living comfortable and their coffers full. Stand up and say no more. Its time there was actually a pro working class movement in this country. 
I dont understand why Republicans keep insisting that theyre not evil...do they even understand what that word means?
"Do food stamps pay for alcohol and cigarettes? ? If so, would it be acceptable to cut that benefit? Would it be acceptable to drug test people who are on food stamps in order to ensure they keep receiving the benefit? Are food stamps on a debit type card or actual stamps? Would it be ok to go to the card type system that requires an ID to ensure they keep their food stamps, basically making only the recipient able to use them?"
1% over the next ten years? Does not seem that bad. 
In the article it states that the cuts are actually a loophole being closed where people could base food stamp needs on deducted earnings that werent in fact accurate of their household worth.
[deleted]
Fuck this country. I need to get the hell out of here. 
Prepare for thousands starving in the streets of America!
Thank god hopefully this gets lazy people off their ass and to work instead of bumming off my paycheck.
"And how many of said people living in poverty somehow have the money for the latest smart phones which I cant even afford, or support their ongoing drug habits? Im not categorizing them all together, but people need a motivator for success. Enough with the handouts."
You should blame the democrats as well since they did nothing to stop this or even put up a fight. 
"We are told not feed the animals in National parks, because the animals will become dependent on handouts and will not be capable of taking care of themselves Same goes for humans, lets try giving the poor a hand up and not a handout. "
Republicans did not win. Theyd need to be battling another side for that to occur.

"Hey, better than the 50 bil they proposed to cut. Silver lining of a shit situation. "
"I wont say if Im Republic or Democrat, but has social programs like food stamps decreased the poverty line? Im saying that as a question, not a statement. Should the government be donating to private charities instead of social programs? It could be said that the Republics are trying to reduce govt debt, which is getting pretty big...idk. I just dont think that they are solely doing this to force people to get shitty jobs at corporations which are owned by the people who vote Republican. Not every republican voter is a rich ceo. Most of their votes are from Middle America. Last time I checked, there were more rich guys in California and NY (democrat states) than Louisiana and Alabama (repub states)"
[deleted]
Whats especially sickening is that many of these Republicans claim to be Christians. Letting people starve is the opposite of Christianity.
My family was poor and never on food stamps and it sure was a great motivator.
This is an extremely lower number than what they wanted. IIRC they wanted 80 billion. This is not a bad deal. Compromise. Were a democracy.

"My girlfriend works with refugees and I can see this as being a huge blow to them. A lot of them get jobs through IRC and organizations like this, but often theyre the jobs that no one else wants like dish washing. They dont pay well so many families rely on food stamps to help feed their families. This isnt just a problem that affects the poor. I think Its going to have a huge ripple effect. "
&gt;a record number As a percentage of population or as a whole number? &gt;poverty Thats not a very descriptive word. What is poverty? How has its definition changed over time?
AWESOME!!!!! Its about time the government stops handing out food stamps to people who do not need them
"Im all for helping those who need it. But far too many times, Ive been waiting in line at the checkout and the person in front of me is using food stamps to purchase top of the line food items. And then buying beer, cigarettes and lotto with cash. It infuriates me because Im buying store brand shit and forgoing things I want so that I can afford the things I need. I live in NYC."
I dont understand. How are so many people unemployed and living in poverty when Obamas stimulus bill was passed?
Theres always money for wars though...
Stealing to give to the poor isnt compassion. If there is a need it willbe filled voluntarily by actors in the marketplace. 
Looks like Ill have to start eating the rich. Ill just sharpening my knife if anyone needs me...
"Im of the opinion that anyone on any sort of federal welfare program should be required to submit a list of everything they are purchasing with their welfare. And if anything is out-of-line, kick them off welfare. "
Finally! A war they can win! 
poor people do not contribute to Republican politicians.... screw them!
"FUUUUUUUUUUUUCKERS!!!! And hey, I just spent $125 on groceries with cash because I have plenty of money but to think there are little kids and old people that dont have enough to eat it breaks my heart... "
Ridiculous...pathetic...sad.
When people starve rebellion follows. 
And farmers that create minimum wage jobs for illegals got their guaranty that they will make a profit no matter what so they can export their crops to other nations. I wonder why the same people that were worried by the US bailing out GM have no problem supporting farming corporations by guarantying them a profit/loans? 
"Wait a minute now, I was told last night that the economic recovery is full speed ahead, and the economy is in better shape now than it has been in a long, long time. Was that not true? I guess what Im saying is that according to the President, the cut in SNAP spending is warranted, right?"
but if we went to war in syria no number would be too high
Republicans should be thrown out of office by wide margins this November. And I dont see them retaking the White House for at least 30 years. Couldnt happen to a more deserving bunch of assholes.
They only live in poverty because they choose to do so! When I was poor I was working three jobs and never took one fucking food stamp! I went to school I got a fucking job and I worked my ass off and not one fucking food stamp! Im one Democrat who thinks we have made a society lazy and uncommitted in to becoming better by giving people a hand out. We make black neighborhoods around the nation because we dont put jobs where they are. Food stamps s/b for old people or single mothers not fucking young punks who are trying to skim the system. So get off your fucking high horse Mother Jones and find these people fucking jobs! 
"I hate how this says republicans, BOTH sides wanted to make massive cuts to food stamps."
Correction: There is a record number of Americans who think goverment aid programs are actual income they are earning.
"Thats pure evil. Keep slashing these programs, people will start dying of starvation - and crime will go way up from people looking to survive on money they can steal. Nothing good is going to come out of this. "
Keep fucking with the people you depend on. Every pot boils over eventually.
"No, Mr. Eichelberger. Its not a loss for Democrats, Its a loss for the American People."
"Republicans further ruining the US and antagonizing the poor, making them hopefully angry. Sometimes I think US republicans are actually paid by foreign governments because they fuck up everything seemingly deliberately. Its definitely not the general population that benefits from right-wing politics. "
"Baffled that many poor Americans support this economic terrorism against THEMSELVES / their neighbors, friends, families and fellow citizens. "
I dont understand the assholes that play these political games. 
Oh chill out theyll all still vote dem and thats all any of you fucking idiots care about anyways.
"My grandfather was known for doing crazy shit like Im 90 years old and the light company has gotten enough money from me. Then hed refuse to pay his bills. Every once in awhile it was The government is keeping the price of food too high and that aint right. I will not pay for oatmeal for the next six months because damn those agriculture cocksuckers all to hell. And then he would steal the food for that length of time. Once he decided hed been overpaying on all groceries so he went to the store, loaded his cart with the amount he felt owed and walked out. That made them even, see. Im not suggesting that we should launch some sort of mass civil disobedience food theft program, just wishing he was around so I could call him and say damn those Washington bastards."
30 years of right wing reagaonomics fuked america up
Good. Cut it all. And redesign a new program where you can only buy ESSENTIAL FOODS!
fuck the poors i want white america and reagan back /s
"Well, I guess I should move away. Maybe Canada. "
As a cashier at a grocery store I can say that many of the things Ive seen food stamps spent on are wasteful and unnecessary. Not saying to get rid of the program but I would like to see more regulation. 
Poor people should vote.
"I hate to bring up actual facts in this group think, but all they did was cut 1% from the program, and ONLY by fraud enforcement. With few exceptions I outline below, no one is being cut from the program and no benefits are being cut. The only people cut from the program are murderers and rapists, and only those convicted AFTER the bill passes. Dont worry, youre still paying for murderers and rapists food stamps if they were convicted earlier."
"Good. You think these people spend it on things they need? Hell no, they spend it on candy bars, soda, and junk food. Id rather see the whole program abolished. That, or much more heavily regulated. FOOD should be on there, not candy bars and junk."
"So.....$9,000,000,000 divided by 45,000,000 people on food stamps, is $200/year or $16.67/month cut per person. Thats really not bad at all. But overall, it saved a ton. "
Nice! This is great next step in ensure a revolt. 
"So... both sides agreed the $9B loophole needed to be cut. Republicans wanted to save that waste, Democrats wanted to put that waste back into the system, essentially adding funding to an ovrrfunded program. I usually vote D or I, but Ive gotta go with the Repubs on this one. Waste needs to be cut anywhere we can cut it. "
About damn time.
as if the elephants vs asses is a legitimate squabble. 
fuck
And suddenly people cant get candybars with it anymore. Oh how I wish.
I think its about time we make a list of addresses for all these guys and post it everywhere. 
Just got done watching Grave of the Fireflies and then I see this when I open reddit. All I can think about is hungry kids.
maybe such a generous food stamp program is a contributer to the record numbers in poverty?
"I gotta hand it to the conservatives in this thread: Youve done a magnificent job of pretending that its not primarily Republicans who are in favor of slashing food stamps, and that Democrats are equally to blame. The ability of the American right wing to bullshit people never ceases to amaze me. And the sad thing is that most liberals and Democrats are poorly equipped to deal with your constant flood of misinformation. Conservatives tend to take their ideology very seriously, and learn to master all the lies and tricks. Liberals tend to be much more casual; politics isnt the central focus of their lives. As a result, they are very easy to lie to. Liberals tend to be trusting and have faith in others, so when you lie right to their faces, they are strongly inclined to believe you and agree with you. This is a nice quality to have in a human being, but it explains why liberals are always having the lunch eaten by conservatives. "
"Hate to say it, but there is so much fraud and abuse in food stamps from my personal view. Of course it helps many also...but it seems like people treat it like free money...as if it doesnt have a cost to the tax payer. Id much rather pay in food stamps than cash (welfare)."
"Sometimes tough decisions have to be made. Cant just keep giving handouts. For every 1 person who uses their foodstamps appropriately, theres 9 who dont. Too many lazy drug and alcohol addicts in this country. Ive been homeless, Ive been on foodstamps, im all for govt assistance if its used appropriately. But its not, and hardly ever is. Maybe im too harsh, I guess Im biased. I watched people get cash assistance only because they had children. Children they had no business having and children they dont take care of. I watched people buy alcohol when they shouldve been buying things that are actually necessary. Then you have me, only thing the govt could offer me were foodstamps. I declined. I was pissed off, and still am, about how little the govt cares about people without children. Thankfully I was smart enough to walk the same stretch every single day and over time the residents on that stretch would get used to seeing me. I would offer to do any odd job for very little pay or for food. That lead to someone letting me shower at their house/apt. Also later lead me to my current job that got me off the streets. Abuse of the system has gone on for too long. Im glad someone has the guts to make these type of tough decisions. "
Eugenics is alive and well.
Hurray! We took away food from our starving people! *High Fives all around*
"And there are millions of sheep who will still remain poor and vote GOP because of a few hot-button religious issues. Oh, the humanity..."
Are they engineering a revolt?
Im glad to see this occur. Im only disappointed there was no structural reductions and only a loop hole being closed. But closing a loophole is a good day in government. Now only a few million more to go.
"Good, maybe thatll cut the obesity rates too. You know America is the only country where even the homeless are still fat?"
 THE DEMS CONTROL THE SENATE. THEREFORE BOTH DEMS AND GOP WANT CUTS IN FOOD STAMPS. QUIT BLAMING THE GOP WHEN IT IS BOTH DEMS AND GOP
wonder if those affected will vote in the next mid term election lets flush out the old bs and get some good ones in there
"Perhaps now the unemployed, lazy people; dependent on government handouts, will get a job. Pay their way. And help stimulate the U.S. economy from within! :D"
"not to mention its already down to $189/month at least that is if your applying as an individual in TN; so yeah, Im gonna buy myself all sorts of steaks and crab legs with my $6.30/day."
"I dont understand why everyone is complaining. You all know NOTHING is going to change. The poor will get poorer, the middle class will become poor, homelessness will rise. The rich will get richer. It will never change because nobody is willing to do what it takes to change it. The people in charge are making too much money to want to change it. Companies have a legion of willing slaves to work for them, for next to nothing. I dont know why I even bother anymore, nothing is going to get better. At least not in our lifetimes it wont."
"I think this is the change required to raise the minimum wage. What with the big corporations accounting for $7bn in food stamps. If this goes on, I see a French Revolution-esque rebellion coming. Storming of the Bastille soon? "
I wonder what 9 Billion in military cuts would look like....
"Welp, there goes the non-violent crime rates. "

Just what I wanted to hear tonight when I already cant afford to fucking live.
Damn those republicans are good at endearing themselves to the general public.
Obama sure gives a lot of lip service to sticking up for the little guy but will he veto this?
My food stamps went from a little over 200 to 189 which I believe is the new maximum for an individual. Right now this is all I have to eat...Im sure I could budget better but its gotten harder to make this stretch and the cut really didnt help that situation out When your hungry or worried about where the next meal is going to come from or keeping a roof over your head its really hard to concentrate on much else....I used to believe in the pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality but the whole system is stacked against that ...if your single and childless society doesnt care if you become homeless ...you become disposable and once you are homeless it becomes that much harder to climb back up I find myself trying to visualize what that would be like and its absolutely terrifying...so while I wouldnt of said this a few years ago I cant see how we can afford not to keep people at least fed know a basic sense ....and how do homeless people serve the interests of anyone? My saddest moments come when I realize that there is no help to stop that situation and sometimes I feel like its inevitable Fuck them for the cuts that brought it down to its current level even if these new cuts thankfully wont effect me 
Theres an election coming up; **vote**. Study up on all the candidates and cast an informed vote for every office thats up for election.
So for reference: a couple 12 packs of soda less per month. 
Good. We cant afford it anyway.
"Just reading through this thread, and... Do yall really view socialism as a viable option? It boggles my mind how anyone thinks an extreme approach is the answer. [cue the down votes]"
Everyone knows that food stamps are abused by people who could definitely live without them. A lot of government programs are. Cutting this budget is hopefully signs that the screening to get them will be stricter. That way this 9 billion can go towards things the country really needs instead of giving people their food budget money so they can buy an Xbox One instead of budgeting and saving. Give an inch take a mile... 
"I used to work in a grocery store in New York and I seen so many people frequently abuse the system to buy things such as: steak, crab, lobster, etc. (things people trying to save money do not buy so liberally). Those instances of abuse are what ruin programs like this for the many - its sad."
"OK, only 1500 more cuts like this to solve our debt"
Do you know how many people exploit the food stamp system? Cmon people...
"The GOP wanted cuts, they got cuts. They really dont care that poor Americans will suffer, they just wanted cuts. On the positive side, farm subsidies were finally cut. Not as much as they should have been, but cut nonetheless."
"Heres my point: Before you even begin bashing one another, first find out what really Farm Bill is.....I mean really spend sometime before you make a judgement... Food Stamp is a big part of Farm Bill.......now investigate why its even called Farm Bill.... Now if you commenting after reading....ehow, Wikipedia, how stuff works, worthless media, or just by making up your mind by the first page of what Google shows you.....you probably should think twice before posting.......unless your entire goal is all about copying and posting... Be an informed citizen........ research what them fuck is Farm Bill, which Congress recently passed is all about!! "
"Fuck, man. Fuckin assholes. Its like they think poor people are just some made up bullshit and poverty doesnt really exist."
"I have a friend whose family is rich, they own like many houses that are already paid off and rent out to other people for even more money. His parents are Republican and forces him to vote on issues like this. His sister got pregnant and decided to list herself as independent so that she could get food stamps. Yep. I have never shaken my head so fast in disappointments. "
"As harsh as this sounds, THANK GOD!!! Imagine all the people they just motivated to educate themselves and get out and vote for interests of the common man. "
I really dont want to see starving people in the streets but in 20 years it might not be a big deal for someone to die of starvation on our streets.
"I dont think they understand what they are doing. People will become more and more desperate. BEST CASE that could happen is the crime rate will increase. WORSE CASE, riots and something similar to the french revolution. "
"The whole program is epicly retarded and out dated. Buy up all the excess food and instead of using it to feed the hungry we tax people and then give them the money. The the US sells all the excess food such as corn and soy for filler and artificial crap. The whole thing needs t o be reworked, a farm bill to actually do something productive with the farms and a social welfare program around feeding the poor, the two no longer should be tied. "
"I find it kinda messed up to have Rs wanting to cut social services, and then oppose any kind of minimum wage increase that would get those people off said social services. I honestly wonder if some of them wont be happy until people are starving and dying on the streets. "
"I predict crime is going to be on the rise... UNLESS the new minimum wage laws tread in to effect... or is that just a helpfull suggestion? I base this on the fact that people will be losing a required monthly resources. Some people who receive foodstamps already have jobs, but cannot sustain their families on the minimum wage alone. So lets remove the foodstamps... and not cultivate some labour union movement or legislate minimum wage laws... chances are people will have to find other ways to supplament those loses in income (like GETTING ANOTHER JOB! YES! Thats the moxie! I have 2 underpaid jobs already, why not a 3rd one? Thatll solve the problem! YEEEEEEEY DEMOCRACY!) "
It will still be double what it was back in 08 when Obama went to work fixing the economy.. Are these even truly cuts or just a decrease in the amount they were planning on increasing the budget? The SNAP annual summary may be one of the largest indicators of how much worse the economy has become under Obama. The number of people on food stamps has risen from 28 million in 2008 to 47 million in 2013. 
"Yeah poverty. I know many people who are able to get a job, but dont because its easier to live off of the government."
This is great news!
So are they trying to piss people off enough to start a revolution? 
Baggerz will get what the deserve come election day.
Yet nobody wants an increase in taxes for the rich....
I needed food stamps for a period of six months in my life. I wouldnt have done it were it not for my kids. It was not glamorous and every day I struggled to get a job and get off them. These people will NEVER understand what they are doing. Its like trying to explain an MMO to a goldfish.
Thank God.... drop in the bucket though
Everybody... GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY
"The title for this link cant be biased at all can it? Im sure theres nothing more to the story, Republicans are just all assholes out to get the poor, thats what the poster would have us believe anyway. /s"
I volunteered to do a Americorps program for a year. Food stamps was a 1/5 of our monthly wage. 20% of anything makes a difference.
Good maybe some will actually get a job now.
"Its not the federal governments job to feed the people of this nation. Their purpose is to govern not provide. You need food, fell on hard times? Look to your community, local churches, friends, family. Yeah, thats right, its called local community. You should try it some time. "
They r really trying to starve the poor to death. 
"Republican politicians - prolife, unless when it comes to the poor, homeless, minorities, homosexuals, non-JudeoChristians, non-Americans, illegal immigrants that may be Christian, or anyone they can go to war with to fill up their pockets with blood money."
Hopefully this will push even more people away from Republicans.
Let them eat cake!
"One old guy I know ran into an eager beaver social worker who got him food stamps, an Obamaphone, and a Ukrainian housekeeper. He laughed his ass off, since he already gets subsidized housing, free transportation, free medical, free hot meal for lunch, etc., mostly from ex-Chicago mayor Richard Daleys vote buying programs for elders (who vote). While he lives on only about $700/month on Social Security, almost all of that is mad money since almost all his expenses are paid by other government programs. Thus he finds it hilarious that he gets food stamps, Obamaphone, and a housekeeper; and being old he repeats this hilarity every time I see him. Almost all government giveaways are rife with fraud and waste, so $9 billion is probably a fraction of what should be cut. Never doubt that we will have to pay the piper eventually from the Democrats bankrupting the country. "
For all of those who arent quote sure on where they stand politically - Libs (most everyone on r/politics) are beta phaggots who blame everyone/everything in the world for their problems except for themselves. The liberal mentality is poisonous and is breeding a generation of effeminate kents that couldnt wipe their own **** without the govt helping them.
"I got an idea. Instead of taking away money from schools and government services, why dont we take money from our huge military budget and oil subsidies. Why the hell do we let the poorer get poorer and the rich get richer? "
In the area I live in I see and know alot of people who live off a food stamps and use it as an excuse to not get a job. I know not everyone that has them does this. 
Do you have any idea the amount of food stamp fraud there is?
About fucking time!
"Apparently the farm bill includes almost a trillion dollars in spending, and attempts to cut $8 billion in food stamps in response to years of documented evidence of misuse and abuse of the program, USDA will need to ensure that illegal immigrants, lottery winners, college students and the dead cannot receive food stamps and that people cannot collect benefits in multiple states. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/01/27/hemp-farm-raised-fish-food-labels-and-food-stamps-whats-in-the-farm-bill/"

"You know, I went and used food stamps one time. It was nice. I just had an issue with it cause when I went to go get food stamps, geez the people that were there, it wasnt pleasant. Its weird but I didnt want to be lumped into that crowd. So when it was up I decided not to renew. What I saw there wasnt starving masses huddling for food. I saw people who just honestly wanted a free hand. I heard a woman gloating about how much she was able to exploit out of the system. They would go there with all their kids, letting them run all over the place wrecking stuff. One kid unraveled all the toilet paper in the mens room for one roll. There was still some left, but it was a mess. After witnessing that I dont mind the cuts. There was nobody there that seems actually down on their luck. They just wanted free stuff."
Nothing like punishing the needy for the actions of a few just to score points with the rich overlords. 
I hope the people affected remember this when they vote. 
"I think the their plan is to create as much unhappiness with the current government as possible. Their own voterbase in several states will be hit hard but the blame will be on the Democrats anyway. Fox to the rescue, haha"
"**A Republican reinterpretation of Matthew 25:31-46** Then, the King said ?I was hungry and you told me that it was my own fault for being lazy and believing that I was entitled to help from hard working families and that I?d probably spent all of my money on alcohol, cigarettes and drugs anyway. I was thirsty and you assumed that I was desperate for gin or vodka, rather than water. I was naked and you said that I would have more chance of a job if I took more care of my personal appearance, even though I wore all I could afford. I was poor and you told me I was a scrounger who just wanted to sponge off the state and put stories about me on the tv and newspapers, despite knowing nothing about my circumstances. I was sick and you denied me any help, told me to go back to work and assumed I was faking illness in order to scrounge. I was in prison and you demanded that the key was thrown away and that I was kept away from all respectable, law-abiding members of society because I was a bad person who could never change. I was a stranger and you ran, scared of me, told me to go home, that your country was full and that I was only there to steal your money, possessions and jobs. For I tell you, whenever you did this for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of mine, you did it to me?

Good job murica
The first rule of a successful state is to keep your citizens fed. Someone could dig up Louis XVI and ask his opinion on this.
"Its OK, they balanced that with a $9B tax cut for the rich most likely, so you know, gotta balance the budget. "
"There was the same article posted earlier, but with a different title, and it was downvoted to oblivion. Reddit sucks when it comes to politics. "
"Im a bit fuzzy on the math of this. By closing a loophole in the SNAP program (and not reinvesting that money back into the program), the article---and the linked-to NYT article---say that ~850,000 households will have their benefits reduced by $90 a month. But how does $90 x 850,000 = $9MM? I assume Im missing something. "

"Being devils advocate here: In my community, the Food Stamp system is abused. A lot the people around me do not need food stamp but cheat the system by owning a business and accepting only cash or have a richer relative put nearly all of the abusers assets under the relatives name. The only evidence I have is actually talking to one of the abusers, my friend. He drives a 2008 bmw, gets financial aid (those aimed at lower income), and gets food stamps. He manages to get all this by having a business that is cash only and putting his house/ car under a different relatives name. edit: I am prepared to be downvoated to hell. Flamesuit zipped up and ready to go. edit2: I am not saying that people dont need these programs. I am giving an example to what the Republicans are using as evidence."
"Why? Seriously why? Republicans justify this by claiming theyre helping to reduce the deficit, and its the biggest load of bullshit Ive ever heard. Anyone who has taken a basic macro economics class can justify otherwise. We need to cut welfare. No, you need to cut social security, because its the biggest chunk of the budget and its not sustainable with an aging baby boomer population. SNAP is a drop in the bucket. I do not understand the right-wing obsession with begrudging everyone that is poor. They think that all poor people are lazy, needle-using moochers who put themselves in the position they are in. Being poor is your fault! The republicans ingenious solution to paying off debt is metaphorically like trying to find as many pennies under the couch cushions as possible, and completely ignoring the $300K mercedes in the driveway that put you in debt to begin with. "
"To be fair, Ive never been dirt poor, but man, my wife and I scrape together to make ends meet. Ive never been on food stamps, WIC, or anything else. I think attitude is the biggest thing that you have to focus on. I got out of the military with no savings and some debt. Got married and almost immediately my wife and I found we were going to have a baby. Nothing focuses your attention like that. I work 50 hours a week, I go to school full time, and my wife coupons like a mad woman. I consider myself on the very low side of middle class right now, but we live pretty well, and my wife watches every penny. What we found, is that by focusing, and paying attention to where everything goes, you can make ends meet. Couponing isnt glamorous, but its incredible to watch a 150 dollar grocery bill shrink down to 30 bucks or so. Im not saying that there arent people out there who can use a hand up, but in my opinion, people just dont focus enough on improving their lives. I would rather have government programs go to education benefits, training programs so people can escape dead-end jobs, and to financial planning classes which will teach people how to be smart with their money. I know people who drive nice cars they cant afford, paying interest thats sky high because they dont make enough to finance a good rate, and who have no problem paying for things they dont need with plastic, who suddenly realize they need some help. "
"So the war on poverty is now the war on the poor. And, no surprise, the rich are winning. Republicans - on the wrong side of every issue and every thing they do is malicious, spiteful, cruel, mean and just plain wrong."
"Can someone please explain to me the justification of cutting a program that actually helps people? Because, It just makes me insane."
"I make minimum wage. I have bills to pay, gas to buy, and I get SIXTEEN dollars a month to help myself to. I sometimes dont know what to spend it on because Im rolling in money. Id say this is bullshit, but this is far beyond the realm of bullshit already."
"The article said... &gt;Both the Senate and President Barack Obama are expected to approve the legislation. and this... &gt;This is the first time in history that a Democratic Senate has even proposed cutting the program. Now the upper chamber is expected to pass cuts twice the level it approved last year. and this... &gt;But Dems deserve much of the blame, the Democratic aide says. and this... &gt;One hundred three Democrats voted against the farm bill, but 89 voted in favor. and this... &gt;Democrats in the House and Senate agreed to cut nutrition aid for poor Americans because they have shifted to the right on SNAP politically, the staffer adds. Oh, please. Mother Jones said all of this directly in the article, yet it chose to craft headline to exclusively blame Republicans? They make me sick. This article is just worthless. Heres the best part. The 9 bill dollars isnt a straight cut to poor peoples food stamps. This is ALSO directly from the article... &gt;The cuts to the food stamp program come from closing a loophole that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed needed to be addressed. A households level of monthly food stamps benefits is determined by how much disposable income a family has after rent, utilities, and other expenses are deducted. Some states allow beneficiaries to deduct a standard utility charge from their income if they qualify for a federal heating aid program called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, even if they only receive a few dollars per year in heating aid. The arrangement results in about 850,000 households getting a utility deduction that is much larger than their actual utility bill. Because the deduction makes these families disposable income appear to be lower than it actually is, they get more food stamp money each month. The farm bill that passed the House on Wednesday saves $9 billion by closing that loophole. So, a loophole was allowing people to essentially lie and claim their income to be lower than it really is. All the 9 billion cut does is close that loophole. Seriously, read the article next time before revvin up the false outrage. So, since the loophole being closed was allowing people to lie about their income and exploit the system, and Democrats voted to block fixing it, I guess all Im supposed to take away from this is that Democrats support exploitation and dishonesty. Well, if thats the case, Ill have some of Jon Stewarts farm with a bit of honey mustard."

I think we should go back to the days of getting powdered milk and a wheel of government cheese. With the modern EBT cards there is not enough shame. I think it should be a shameful thing to need assistance and that should be a motivating factor for people to meet their own needs.

Thats going to generate great headlines and Vine movies. Boehner is known to eat at diners. Grab his [whatever] from his plate, see how much he likes being fucked with himself."

This article lacks context. $8 billion over ten years is $800 million annually of a $80 billion a year program. It was a cut of one percent. Hardly slashing.

"Cool, maybe this is the last drop to finaly get the revolution going ..."
Still think the government is there to protect you?
"Good job again GOP! See you in 2020! Since, you know, theres no way in hell youre winning in 2016."
I see what the GOP are doing. [They are effectively trying to organize armed resistance to the government.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_world_food_price_crisis) 
"Good. Too many people taking advantage of services in the first place. Not to mention those who sell their food stamps for cash, so they can buy things they dont need. There are many jobs out there a person can get with zero experience. Just gotta put that ego aside and work for what you want. Put those exploiting the system in fast food jobs, so assistance can go where its actually needed. "
Im doing a donation to my local food bank. Anything to help because no kid should ever go hungry. Wish I could do more. 
"What I dont understand is why half of the people of this country continue to empower the republican party. They run on a platform that promises to take away liberties, imprison people, violate constitutional rights and yet identifies itself as the party of God, family and goodness. The end result though brings death, war, destruction and enrichment of the elite at the expense of general population. They win elections through promises of get rich quick, vote rigging, fear and intimidation and then proceed to hold the country in a state of artificially created poverty that they increase exponentially through legislation. Its so crazy that its like, if say in the middle of his reign, Hitler lost an election, but the people leave his party in tact and will let him run again, because hey, we have to protect our democracy, even if his win ensures the dismantling of the democracy and the principles that we rely on it to protect and administer for the good of all. Just bizarre. If I live to be a hundred and one, Ill never understand why they were allowed to continue on in the manner that they do when all it would take is to simply not vote them into office and disempower them. "
"Wow, cant tell this is a leftist page of crying, can you ?"
Spending more on the military than the rest of the world combined? Better take $9 billion away from the poor to mitigate military costs.
If the dems had not lost the employment war this would not be an issue 
That will speed up the revolution. 
I wonder if measures like these will push middle and lower class americans to regain Class Consciousness. If the Middle and Lower class stopped acting like petty bourgeoisie and got organized they would have tremendous power. 
"Honestly, if the economic recovery is going well...doesnt that make sense? Basically, if people can support themselves why shouldnt they start winding down all the aid...unless of course the economy isnt doing well or Democrats just want to keep their base riled up and in control. "
"How do these people get enough votes to be elected into parliament is just beyond me. There should be protests about this, i mean this is the livelihood of many people and their just taking them away to invest the money on other stuff such, and im thinking mostly war. This is fucked up big time. Im not american, but seriously, wdf?? Is taking food from people a solution to their problems? *really???*"
I agree. 
"Yeah. After Obama increased food stamp spending by a huge amount, were supposed to fund food stamps at that level forever. Forget that. Screw the food stamp program, not the taxpayer."
Ah yes well decrease the number of poor people and people seeking work all in one fell swoop! Well just starve the poor! Its two birds with one stone!
"Ill say this and keep it simple. Alot of Americans live in poverty because theyre lazy or spend most of the hours of their day selling or searching for drugs. I came from a poor household and lived in a less than desirable neighborhood, I have seen this first hand."
This sounds like a great idea. In the same week Im hearing about food stamp cuts alongside a staunch refusal to raise the minimum wage. Just what the heck is the agenda here? Do they -want- civil unrest?
"Republicans pretend to care about the top 51% simply to get votes, but really they only care about the top 1%. Just look at their actions. "
I happen to be poor. And yet I dont qualify for food stamps because I actually work and dont have children. I know a lot of people that lie to get good stamp money and then sell their card for real money. They didnt need the government handout. They wanted it because its their career choice. To live on welfare. They need to put a time limit on all forms of welfare and have more strict guidelines and do research to prove that what people are saying their situation is is the truth. 
If these poor people survive to the next election they need to make their voices heard. 
"The Dems are constantly telling me that the economy has recovered so it would make sense to start to rein in some of the spending increases that were only done as a result of the economy being bad, right? Or are the Dems lying again? "
"This will probably be downvoted but Im tired of caring. A democrat has been in office now for over 5 years. In doing so, he has made some pretty drastic changes to the economy. Those changes have an effect and we are seeing that. I am not saying that it is the only cause and Im not saying he is the only to blame but to ignore the effects of his presidency when this site has put ALL economic blames on this last presidency is completely hypocritical. So now, we have a higher unemployment rate and we have more people who have stopped looking for a job than who are. We have spent trillions on the war on poverty since LBJ and literally nothing has gotten better. There are more poor now as a % of the population than there was when it was declared. The ONLY effect the war on poverty has is to buy the poor vote for democrats. With that said, it is mind boggling when all welfare programs has utterly failed, we contain down the same path. Every time the argument is said, they fail because its not enough! and welfare is increased, the poor do not decrease and they arent all of a sudden better off. Increasing welfare has literally never worked. Yet, because people emotionally feel it works, its still propagated. "
I believe someone should post the picture of paris Hilton at the club wearing a shirt thats says stop being poor 
"I say get rid of the whole food stamps program and all current welfare plans. Replace it with a guaranteed basic income for every US citizen. Raise taxes on the very wealthy. Lets preempt automation and further outsourcing, eliminate bureaucracy connected to welfare programs, and create a truly even playing field for everyone. Otherwise, we will descend into a form of techno-feudalism where the rich can truly own and operate everything without the need for the working class. We are fast approaching a probable post-scarcity society, yet the outlook for the masses is bleak. "
Maybe this is why Obama is pushing for minimum wage increase?
Poverty is swelling and majority of households live paycheck to paycheck. How much more can the people take?
"Honestly, this is just another propaganda headline to make the Republicans look like the super-villains and the Democrats look like the heroes coming to save the day... /r/politics is too full of all this lopsided media..."
"Meh, most likely not. Its the ol question of conventional wisdom vs reality. And by conventional wisdom I mean the idea that if you remove average Joes three meals a day then average Joe well revolt. The three meals a day is not a constant but an example of comfortable, ? acceptable or passable living (take your pick). Besides, comparing states is futile and you know it. It might not effect the people in your area but the US is HUGE. Add the fact that there are individual state laws and we have a lot of ground to cover before we come anywhere close to approximating the actual effect that this will have on a per state basis. But, time will tell... and food stamps are a pretty half-assed solution to deeper, more serious socio-economic problems. And hopefully the outcome well be positive, or at least progressive. Who knows? Maybe this will be the straw that breaks the camels back, or rather the laborers back. PS: Im not actually in the US or a US citizen. Im just a Norwegian... watching from the sidelines... I dont even talk to my friends who are US citizens about US domestic politics anymore. It seems to me that state and county lines are often worlds apart. I could be wrong though..."
"American politics, its just hilarious....."
Make budget cuts to the NSA instead much?
We need another Amendment. Congress shall make no law that adversely affects a service provided to needy constituents without benefitting in equal part another such service.
Republicans .... Democrats same thing these days no ? 
How much more of this crap must happen before the people do something about these ~~BRIBED OUT OF WHACK~~lobbied reptiles?
The whole food stamp program needs an overhall. When I worked at a grocery store I would see people on food stamps selling the food to other people for cheap so they can use the cash tto buy alcohol and cigarettes. This happened all the time. 
"Yeah lets ignore the fact that humans have to meet basics needs in order to succeed elsewhere. We learned about it early in grade school, but apparently Republicans think being hungry will motivate people to pull themselves out of poverty faster. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Maslow%27s_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg"
"worth mentioning, a record number of americans are living in poverty because the obama administration redefined poverty in 2010, changing the equation of how it is calculated. the administration literally created its own talking points by changing how things are calculated and then comparing the newer (larger) numbers to the old administrations calculations which were lower. it is nothing more than a manufactured crisis to say that poverty is at a record high. another thing worth noting is units of measure. &gt;In addition to the $9 billion in food stamp cuts in this **five-year farm bill** so this actually is $2b a year. be careful not to compare 1 year figures to multi year figures, like when people take 1 year of welfare fraud (roughly 100billion) and compare it to 10 years of military fraud (roughly 1 trillion) and try to insist that the military is 10x as wasteful. (theres also the fact that the cut isnt really a cut anyways. it closes a loophole that was being exploited.)"
This is not right. Of all the programs that could be cut...its Americas kids who suffer the most. You reap what you sew.
"A narrow majority of Democrats opposed the bill, but among the 89 who backed the measure were the party?s very top leaders, including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D- Calif.), Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C), the assistant Democratic leader. Read more: http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/house-farm-bill-102806.html#ixzz2ruc75VbR"

"This whole thing isnt about a rancher paying bills. Its about Harry Reids son being the head of a Chinese land firm, and wanting to sell the land at immanent domain prices using a former aid of Reids, who happens to he the head of the BLM, so his sons company can frack on the land. Theres proof of this on stormcloudsgathering youtube channels video Bundy ranch, what youre not being told."
"You have been utterly misinformed: The solar plant Reids son is building is almost 150 miles away from Bundys ranch. There is a solar plant about 10 miles away on an Indian reservation that has nothing to do at all with Reid. http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/nevada.asp This is not to say there isnt a real scandal regarding Rieds abuse of power regarding that plat, but it has literally NOTHING to do with Bundy or his decision in 1993 to stop paying grazing fees. You might also be interested to know that Nevadas own constitution compels the federal government to take armed action to enforce its laws- Article 1, Section 2 of the Nevada Constitution: the Paramount Allegiance of every citizen is due to the Federal Government in the exercise of all its Constitutional powers as the same have been or may be defined by the Supreme Court of the United States; and no power exists in the people of this or any other State of the Federal Union to dissolve their connection therewith or perform any act tending to impair, subvert, or resist the Supreme Authority of the government of the United States.

"This literally took me 5 seconds to shoot down with google. Unions have been given waivers, but so have a lot of non-union affiliated at all corporations. &gt; We contacted the HHS and asked for the number of waivers they?ve granted so far. A spokeswoman told us that they have approved 1,372 applications and denied 92. Of the approved applications, 27 represent unions and another 315 represent plans jointly managed by unions and employers. Even if you took the broadest definition possible, counting all the joint plans as union plans, only 25 percent of the waivers have gone to unions. The rest have gone to plans offered by employers, insurance companies and other non-union groups. &gt; To be clear, though, **the waivers do not exempt these groups from the health care law.** They only allow them to continue offering their current health plans with annual limits **until 2014.** [Unions dont have to comply with Obamacare, says Crossroads GPS](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/23/crossroads-gps/unions-dont-have-comply-obamacare-says-crossroads-/) Which was found via this page: [The flood of falsehoods about the health care law](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/mar/21/health-care-fact-checking/) Which came up with this google search: [fact check union aca waiver](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fact+check+union+aca+waiver)"

"On May 5, 2013, PolitFact rated a statement by retired tennis star and gay rights activist Martina Navratilova that there are 29 states in the United States in which a person can be fired for being gay as Half True.[67] On May 7, Rachel Maddow sharply criticized this rating, noting that PolitiFacts own assessment found that there were in fact 29 states that do not prohibit such discrimination by employers. She dismissed PolitiFacts arguments that some cities within those 29 states offer protection to gay employees and that some employers voluntarily do not discriminate against homosexuals as immaterial to what Navratilova actually said.[68] The Daily Kos expressed similar objections, while also reiterating their criticism of some of PolitiFacts previous assessments. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com ...theres also a lot of other examples there of why politifact is for lazy idiots."
"Thanks for the response! Id say 29 states where people can be fired for any reason and have no statewide protection against orientation discrimination, despite some municipal exceptions is more or less equivalent to 29 states where someone can be fired for being gay. It definitely seems like Politifact reads a lot into what an audience *might* think when assessing truth. Having said that, what part of this story, specifically, did they get wrong? A source is just a source. If theyre passing opinions off as facts, you do more to warn people away from them by presenting the erroneous facts on a case-by-case basis."
Have you got anything other than the word of Fox News that the content of the story is true?

"And youre a stooge of a single obviously biased reporter, Avik Roy. In fact, good ol Avik gives no source for his phony 5 million people figure. His only sources are citing how many people have enrolled, and how they enrolled.

But at least that scumbag is backing down from his original 80 million people will lose the insurance.

"So, can I take it this is you admitting your 5 million people figure was full of shit? It seems that way, since you didnt acknowledge the issue. But since this has turned into a source bash, why would you ever cite a magazine catering to corporate pigs everywhere? Its just that type of greedy special interest that has fucked what we knew of as our democracy. Good luck buddy."
"So you counteract Forbes with USA Today, a died in the wool liberally biased organization that uses guestimations instead of facts. Your first article is an opinion piece with no factual support. The second one is at least from FactCheck.org (another liberally slanted organization, but at least better than USA Today) and acknowledges that people will lose their healthcare but doesnt come up with a number because it admits it doesnt have one. So you are a stooge to the liberally biased media, and more importantly to the Administration. Its obvious from your reply that you havent read the article, merely skimmed it, saw a sentence that fit your narrative and moved on. USA Today is a paper that supported President Obama in both of his elections and backed his If you like it, you keep it statement that even he acknowledged was false. What more do you people need? The administration is full of shit (like most administrations) and the bill is broken and badly needs a rewrite. WAKE. THE. FUCK. UP. Have a lovely day. "

"Its frustrating that Republican defenders have such poor reading comprehensive and critical thinking skills. Pointing out that Obama lies, but does so less than the (Republican-offered alternatives) isnt an excuse. Its well supported by, for example, Mitt Romneys record during the last campaign; a stunning [533 Mitt Romney Lies!](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2012/08/29/mitt-romney-tells-533-lies-in-30-weeks-steve-benen-documents-them/) Politifact Ratings (Mostly False or Lower) * [Barack Obama](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/) 26% * [Mitt Romney](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mitt-romney/) 41% To go back a bit further, Obamas lies are in-arguably less awful than the Bush lies that cost us two trillion dollars, and the lives of 100,000+ people. Finally, you also told me to Call a spade a spade, call a liar a liar. Thats an odd thing to say in response to my comment, He did lie about this and other things. In other words, I called a liar, a liar. "
Call a spade a spade was admittedly not the best analogy. My point was that it is unnecessary and counterproductive to point the finger back at Republicans every time Obama lies or screws up.
We are. Saying he was the least shitty option IS calling a spade a spade. There was no less shitty option than Obama. At least not any any ballot that Oklahomans will see.
"Why do you have to make that excuse? Every time he does something terrible the chorus of But Better Than A Republican comes in to soften the situation up for their guy. Its partisan and unproductive. Call a spade a spade, call a liar a liar. "
"Your entire response confirms exactly what Im talking about. You spent nearly the entire post demonstrating how much more Republicans lie than Democrats...who is that news to? Im not a Republican defender and Ill call them on their crap every time, including the entire Bush train wreck. You of course assumed Im conservative just because Im critical of Obama, the exact kind of partisan bullshit Im talking about. Youve certainly got me on semantics, though. Congratulations. Pointing the finger at Republicans every time an Obama lie is mentioned isnt by definition an excuse but its a distraction and serves no purpose other than to create camps of us vs them and soften criticism of the liar who is the topic of discussion. Im sure you also understood my intent behind the call a spade a spade comment (call a spade a spade without having to remind everyone about the shitty diamond), but again chose to piddle around with semantics. "
"They modeled ObamaCare after the jet program, only more waste, and failure rate even higher. So your beloved program sucks even worse. How about we get the government out of all of it."
"Good liberal response, never answered my question of how to get the government out of it. They cant run a lemonade stand, much less this. They would have had injected far less trauma if they had just included all these poor democratic voters with no health insurance in Medicaid, and left the rest alone. Thats where those are going anyway, but along with it are 93 million others who had insurance, now being cancelled all because of ObamaCare. Not to mention hundreds of thousands getting their work hours cut back from full time to 29 hours, all because of ObamaCare. Looking forwards to seeing the results of 2014 elections. And all the hoopla with Obama refusing to delay the individual mandate, and accepting the government shutdown to protect it, bullshit, he wants to delay it. Like everything thing else out of his mouth.................a big LIE!"
"&gt; They modeled ObamaCare after the jet program, (...) No, it was modeled after [RomneyCare](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/mar/20/romneycare-and-obamacare-can-you-tell-difference/) in Massachusetts. You know Mitt Romney, the guy that ran against Obama in 2012 and ran against his own healthcare law. "
Its hard to find a good troll these days...
"So can I have a ride in your Republican Time Machine or are you just wearing Tea Party colored glasses? I would say the ACA hasnt been out yet long enough to make such sweeping statements.

I dont have a problem with anybody owning a gun, I own one myself since Im a pussy and could never defend my family or myself with my hands. But when you take them out in public and display them during supposedly peaceful protests, you are accomplishing nothing but scaring those around you. If you fire shots in anger, you automatically forfeit your freedom and hopefully your life."
"That is a retarded comeback, nothing I said came from FOX, but first line of liberal retort is claiming someone is a parrot for FOX. You people dont seem to realize the worn out excuses you frequently use to discredit someone, fail to move the needle on the meter. And Reid is a sleaze with plenty of history of corruption."
"And my guess is you are one of those that gets off on the government taking away peoples freedom by using force. And yes, the government could have prevailed, but the cat was out of the bag on Harry Reid and his son throwing Bundy off the land his family had been using for decades, just so they could make more corrupt deals by subverting the force of the government for themselves. yep, its those despicable teabaggers getting in your way."
"I was young, so its hard for me to say with authority, but in my opinion the country was in much better shape under Clinton than now. Call it coincidence maybe, but Ill take the 90s over this shit."
Clinton was the same exact way. When he gave speeches everyone including people who hated him were enthralled.
"I voted for him too, and I dont regret it unlike plenty of others who voted him into office. The way I see it, Obama has really opened my eyes to the current state of our politics. The first black president, Change, and all these other phrases that tricked us into believing that this president would be different. This president has shown me the current state of our political system. It doesnt matter how different any given candidate may be, the citizens are going to get screwed either way. The face of who is fucking us may change, but the fact still stands that we are getting royally fucked by whoever is in charge. "
"i dunno, is it better to vote for the guy who can talk about the right things and maybe do them sometimes, or the guy who says all the wrong things and hope he accidentally does the right thing sometimes?"
"Before you beat yourself up for that, consider how bad the offered alternative could have been."
"I dont blame the people that voted for him the first time around, but the second time it blows my mind that people hadnt caught on to his constant lies. This is NOT saying mitt Romney should have won, just that Im amazed how many people still supported Obama after his first term. "
"Reminds me of the horrible things the Bush administration did to go to war...much, much worse."
"The Dems were always going to run him again no matter what, and nobody wanted to vote for a spoiler and as a consequence end up with Romney. Everybody was over a barrel. I have a really hard time believing that Romney even actually had all of the support that he supposedly had. After all of the Snowden revelations, what we know about Diebold, the tampering allegations in 2000 and 2004... I dont really have much faith in the election process at large anymore. Who knows whats fabricated and whats not."
But come on. Remember who our alternatives were. 
"I voted for Obama once, when he ran for the Illinois Senate. Once I realized he was all talk and charisma, I never voted for him again. He unfortunately did very little as Senator of Illinois, except launch his Presidential campaign. Im not saying that Romney would be doing a better job. I didnt vote for him, either. Lets just say Im very much looking forward to 2016. Ive had enough of Obamas ineffective leadership. "
"I never felt worse voting than voting for that fucker a second time, knowing it was him or Romney I chose the evil i already knew would lie to and disappoint me. "
"Dont feel bad. Its not like your vote would have changed anything, anyway."
"Yep, that was vomit worthy. EDIT - LOL at the cascade of downvotes on this."
"With all of the Congressional gerrymandering, I think were in for a looooooooong, bad ride. :( Even without it, the Dem party has been slowly morphing into Reagan-lite for years. Who do we have in Congress who really represents us anymore? Sanders? Warren? Thats 2 out of... 530 something?"
"Hes followed through on [78% of his campaign promises.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/) If I were a betting guy, then Id take those odds every time"
Then youre part of the problem.
"The really scary thing is that as much of a disappointment as hes turned out to be (I voted for him as well), Im still pretty sure he was the lesser of two evils."
"I think most of us that voted for him, really just were more scared of the alternative: Mittens and John Sara Palin McCain."
"Yes, lest we forget, he campaigned on abolishing this kind of surveillance, then oversaw its expansion. Fucking letdown."
"Meh. [Your last presidential election, you voted for the shinier of two turds.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX_1B0w7Hzc)"
Go to a comments section or forum about obama from like December 2008. Its absolutely crazy the things people said. And I was one of them. 
"I think its pretty standard for any President who can give a decent speech. Its part that saying things is easer than doing things, part that not everything is in the Presidents control no matter what he may say, and part that speeches can, and have been, given simply to pacify people without an action following. "
Just like the old joke. how can you tell a politician is lying?
"Eh, better than the other guy."
I feel ya. I still hold out that it was better than the alternative.
"And thank god you did. Regardless of the fact that his presidency was 75% lies, at least when I graduate I may have a job. Cant say McCain or Romney wouldnt have fucked us more."
"I was instantly turned off from the article when he said &gt;That?s when I fully internalized that many Democrats literally had no actual political beliefs other than we support Obama in everything that he does, even when he takes precisely opposite positions in a three week period Now, please note - I think Greenwald is a superb journalist (for the most part). But I think this was a bit much. I know PLENTY of democrats, especially those who are actually progressive rather than the left that has been created by a huge vacuum of sanity by the right that shifted the spectrum and skewed things. I think hes done a lot of great things - I think the healthcare reform should have gone further, but I accept that he could only get so much done given that he didnt *really* have a super majority. However, this whole NSA thing? While there are things I still support him on, I am still hostile about the NSA thing. If he comes around and gets something implemented - then I will evaluate that. But I will not forget that he was going on about how Snowden was a criminal and that they did not consider him a whistleblower. Nor will I forget that he acted like it was a great thing at first. People can sometimes get new information that makes them rethink things. This happens, its called admitting you were wrong and accepting reality. Another example is his stance on medical and now recreational use of marijuana. He cracked down on more dispensaries than Bush, and now has totally reversed course. Does this mean his prior behavior is okay? Hell no. But Im not going to say that making the right choice later - even if politically convenient - isnt still making the right choice. I can gripe about *why* he did it, but he did it and thats what is far more important. Well, thats my opinion anyway. Everyone is free to disagree."
"And lets not forget, though, that over the summer what he was saying was that we would have arrived at these reforms and conclusions about spying on Americans *without* Snowden. The President was *just about to get there!!!* That pesky kid foiled the big surprise! One of the biggest lies ever told in his Presidency, right up there with going on Leno and saying there was no domestic spying program at all."
"Obama has really honed it into an art form, though. Bastard can sure TALK. And I voted for the guy. "
"He campaigned on an awful lot, very little of which got any more than lip service. The ACA is a marginal improvement, but mostly a big sloppy love letter to insurers. Its disappointing to watch supposedly left-leaning pundits try so hard to sell it. I do think that a mandate is inevitable, but so much about the program is just fucked in a misguided and cynical attempt to preserve the insurance industry and prevent a shake-up in medical supply pricing strategies (which are all totally fucked and NEED a shake up.) Thered be a lot of fallout from establishing universal healthcare in the US because of the layers and layers of job-creating and pocket-stuffing bureaucracy that currently exist, but its the ONLY real solution."
and yet youre still better off than with the other guy :(
&gt; And I voted for the guy. He was better than the alternative. Thats about the only positive thing you can say.
I cant say hed be much worse but I dont think hed be a lot better. Congress is the real issue anyway.
If I had my way Ron Paul would be president right now
"If you like the guy you voted for, you can keep him..."
"Uh isnt this what all politicians have to do? Isnt this more a culture of our political system and 24 hour news that will slam everything and blow small things out of proportion for ratings. Has made politicians afraid to enact any changes. Case in point the heat Obama is taking for trying to fix a health care system that everyone agrees is broken, corrupt, and overcharging us for everything."
I challenge the people of reddit to find me a single candid picture of the president since he took office. The dude only appears for highly staged photo-ops. 
"Hes either the biggest sociopath ever born, or hes a puppet with a gun to the back of his neck. Maybe both."
"It blows me away everyday that I bought everything this guy said, hook, line and sinker, and it honestly seems like he could not do any of the things he said he would do. He either really believed he could do what he promised but couldnt get our incompetent Congress to make any real legislative decisions. Or hes just a puppet for the aforementioned incompetent Congress and the corporations that have spent millions on them. Either way, the American people have most definitely lost."
and youll vote for the next guy/girl wont you? cus gosh golly what if that *other* guy wins!? Goodness where will we be then?!

"&gt;And I voted for the guy. Me too. And I, for one, will never vote for him again!"
"I did to and given the choice I had in the ballot box, I would again. We need campaign finance reform, redistricting reform and an end to first past the post or this lesser of two evils shit will never stop."
Im sure Romney would have been better. 
"Maybe its just me, but how couldnt anybody spot that hes just that... a voice? Him and Romney both struck me as windbags. I didnt pay much attention to Obama or McCain during Obamas first go (I was too young to vote so I just wasnt interested), but do all Presidential candidates come across as nothing but talkers? "
Voted for him in 2008. Felt molested and violated. Not in 2012.
That is why I never vote for anyone. That way they can never do some things that I disagree with later.
yeah he told me he would fight for healthcare and did nothing. he told me we with withdraw from iraq and did nothing. he told me he would give us a consumer finacial protectional agency and modify the rules to make it harder for the banks to screw us and did nothing come the fuck on dude.. yeah he is a fucking politician like all fucking politicians but dont pretend he hasnt done shit for us. YEAH HE FUCKS US WITH the whole NSA THING.. but you people who pretend he is all talk are part of the fucking problem. DO YOU REALLY THINK LIKE WOULD BE BETTER WITH PRESIDENT BOMB BOMB BOMB IRAN MCCAIN.. WHO THOUGHT IT WAS A WISE IDEA TO PICK PALIN? 
"Voting for talk is *important*. It shows where the mandate is. Even if a politician fails to deliver, you shouldnt be upset that you voted for the *platform* that he promised. It sends a message that this is the platform you want. You should also vote for the platform you want next time. You should keep doing it. Politicians will *always* disappoint you. Its your job to sway where the mandate goes. Dont vote for people. Vote for platforms."
"American politics are a bunch of popularity contests between the rich &amp; privileged. You didnt have much of a choice in the first place. Although, Obama was known to be for warrantless spying before his 2008 candidacy."
"Be sure to vote republican next time, right guys? .......right?"
"Oh yes. Bush was doing bullshit, but at least he was doing what he said! Obama says nice things and then does bullshit. But at least this should be the final lesson about how much one can trust a politician like him. Next time we need a real progressive candidate. Dont forget that people do not hate Obama for his left *promises* and *rethorics*, they elected him twice over those! The country is far far more left than the establishment thinks! They hate him because his actions are the polar opposite. "
"The world would be much better off if McCain or Romney had have won. A lot of Iranian civilians who are alive today would have been killed by now, etc. /s"
And he has entire opposition based solely on the color of his skin.
Reddit: That bastard Obama violated our rights by collecting our precious bodily metadata fluids! Im so angry at this breach of my privacy that I barely bring myself to post pics of my coworkers daughter on r/facebookcleavage or dox a woman who had the temerity to roll up her shirt at the Sochi Olympics!
Lol thered only so much you can do when dumbasses stop you every inch of the way. Presidents arent sone godly king like entity. 
I think it was greenwald that said that Obama speaks in such a way that he leaves you feeling like hes on your side no matter which side of an issue you are on.
"Its not that hes good, hes not, its that his believers are easily lead by the nose, which is worse. "
Its almost like he is talking about something he can not legally fully explain it control 
Would you rather vote for romney or mccain? :D
"The argument I remember Rand making was that extended unemployment reduces employability and that is true and not controversial. The next part is the troublesome bit because he assumes extended unemployment benefits tend to make people stay unemployed longer, thus making the long term effects of unemployment worse, and economic research shows that is mostly untrue."
"The reason I dialed that back was that Id read that the consensus was that extending unemployment benefits in a depressed economy extended joblessness by a week or two so while it does extend joblessness the impact is very small. Whats more, there is evidence that that cutting benefits [reduces labor force participation](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-17/north-carolina-shows-how-to-crush-the-unemployed.html). I should have said it was true but sleazy bullshit."

Thanks Obama.
The list of promises he had kept is probably shorter
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/
My premium (Humana) went down last year. I even got a refund because they made more profit than allowed by the healthcare law.
"The title of this post is Obamacare Is Already Forcing Private Insurers To Lower Their Premiums. I cited premium growth in 2013 and 2012. What does a graph illustrating 10%+ premium growth in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 have to do with either the post or my reply?"
I have around 200 employees in 4 operating units. Every quote we have received for our group health insurance plan for the past 2 years has represented an increase of 10-14%.
"So nearly as bad as in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 then? http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/factchecking-health-insurance-premiums/premium-growth/"
"You do understand that emergency services account for only about [2-10%](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/28/nick-gillespie/does-emergency-care-account-just-2-percent-all-hea/) of total health care spending. Most of the time, you have plenty of time to shop around. "
"Not having single payer, in other words, having a figurative gun to your head when you blindly accept treatment without being able to know what the procedure will cost, let alone have the time and security to shop around for the best price, it makes me think of that early Simpsons episode where Lisa is trying to buy a rare record to honor the memory of Bleeding Gums Murphy, and upon finding out the musician is deceased, Comic Book Guy immediately marks up the price of the record. Its pure insanity how were doing things. In 50 years people are going to look back and shiver at how we lived so dangerously, skirting financial ruin by just hoping were not slammed with a medical crisis."
Our health insurance works similarly.
"Money goes from the corporations into the pockets of politicians who make the laws. Those corporations dont pay them unless they make the laws that benefit the corporations. The corporations are so big and have so much money, the politicians feel they cant win elections without these massive donations, so they acquiesce. Its legal, its awful, and its not democracy. Sorry to burst your bubble, but America is corrupt. "
"How is this even legal in America? Brit here, and one big thing we learn about the US is that its supposed to have a legal environment that encourages competition, innovation and growth in business above all else - so how on earth can something like this be allowed? I know there are vested interests at play, but it just seems bizarre from this side of the pond that you could just ban a company from selling a perfectly legal product to people simply because other businesses are worried about losing customers. "
"Im not saying i agree with it, because I do not, but the reason dealerships have superiority is because years ago people were worried that the large car companies would either overprice, not provide local service, or simply not care about all of its customers. So, to try to protect the consumer, politicians felt that dealerships would be able to provide good local service and actually care about their customers. However, as you can see, technology has changed and so should politics."
"&gt; but America is corrupt. Well, yeah, but this seems egregious even by the usual standards of corporate lobbying. "
"The United States is a Corporatocracy. Politicians are elected by and large by virtue of who is able to spend the most money on a campaign ([80%-95% of the time](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/17/occupy-wall-street/occupy-wall-street-protesters-sign-says-94-percent/)). Campaign contributions come from multiple avenues, but where it counts the most, they come from corporations and rich businessmen like the Koch brothers. Those donations come at a cost. Its not outright bribery, but youll always notice the corporations puppets coming to their aid when they need it. See Governor Christie of New Jersey recently banning direct sales of Tesla cars. He got a lot of money from the states auto dealers to protect their interests. If Tesla had donated more than them, Tesla direct sales probably wouldnt have been banned. See the MPAA and the RIIA and their constant battle against the internet, file sharing, and streaming. Instead of adopting better business models and innovating (the supposed American Way), they used their puppets in the Government to block progress at every turn. See the Walt Disney Company profiting from public domain stories and then lobbying for stricter copyright laws to prevent other companies from following suit and competing with them. We need a Constitutional Amendment to get money out of politics, but what do you think the odds of getting that passed are at this point?"
"Consider how on the one hand, [we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world!](http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/pages/corporate-tax-rates-table.aspx) Conservatives wept! ...but our businesses actually pay corporate taxes at [one of the lowest rates in the world.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/01/news/economy/corporate-tax-rate/) Murica! Some states of no sales tax. Some have 10% sales tax. Its really a big complicated mess. I guess our reputation comes from a clear-eyed worship of the dollar over any other relationship. If you have money, you can make more money. If you dont, get fucked."
"&gt; Brit here, and one big thing we learn about the US is that its supposed to have a legal environment that encourages competition, innovation and growth in business above all else Yeah, no. We really have an environment where whoever can buy off the most politicians and corner a market wins. "
In other news: Reddit likes cats.
"Would the country really be any worse off if illegals, welfare gibe-me-dats bused in from the ghettos and sophomore college kids couldnt vote? How about people earn some stake in the nation before theyre allowed to decide its future?"
"To be fair, the Obama administration also wants to stop Democrats from voting. (See: NSA)"

Two years ago was the last election.
Ultimately GOP wants to stop everybody from voting.
Right and the Democrats want Republicans to vote? Anyone remember the two new black panthers who stood outside a voting center with night sticks that were caught on video. Remember how Eric holder did not go after them?... But its just the big bad GOP. 
"Just the dead ones... and the ones that vote multiple times... and the ignorant.... illegals.... the uninformed... Radical special interests.... Yep, GOP doesnt want democrats to vote...."
everybody gerrymanders.
http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/barack-obama-voting-rights-105645.html Obama: GOP wants to stop Democrats from voting 
I think they really just want to keep dead people and non-citizens from voting. 
I really want Obama to propose to congress making Voting Day a federal holiday. Then see how conservatives try and spin that one. 
"&gt;This recent effort to restrict the vote has not been led by both parties. It?s being led by the Republican Party.? http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/03/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-rhode-islands-voter-identificatio/ One of the first states in the union to pass voter ID bill was Rhode Island, 85 percent Democratic legislature, she said. And who pushed it? A black Democrat in the house, a black Democrat in the senate. Thats a fact! "
"I think stopping Democrats from voting [multiple times per person](http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2014/03/21/democrats-convicted-poll-worker-hero/6712981/) would be less disingenuous. Parading her around at a voter rights rally was tacky as shit, to say the *VERY* least. This is why I left this stupid party. Utter hypocrisy. You guys shot yourselves in the foot these next couple elections. Not the republicans. "
"*Whew!* Since Obama said it, we know its a lie. I was getting worried and Reddit almost had me convinced those rascally Republicans were up to something. :)"
Duh.
...more than once.
And he is unwilling to do anything about it.
"There is one clear difference between the Democratic and Republican parties. Democrats want you to vote and Republicans dont. I dont find the latter to be very American, very democratic or the least bit inclusive. Not only would I like to see Election Day as a federal holiday but also have mandatory voting laws as they do in Australia. Mandatory with stiff prison sentences for those who interfere with this basic right."
No. 431 in the continuing series of stupid/asinine/out-right lies that Obama has said.
Does anyone think this is not the case?
If we could just get acorn to shut down... /s
Barack Obama has taken on the mantle of Captain Obvious.
"Sorry Obana, just the dead ones and the ones who arent legally entitled to vote."
OMG our president is a fucking retard.
"Um, a photo ID does not single out Democrats. http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/25/democratic-governors-association/democrats-group-says-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-de/"
According to recent polls the the biggest barrier to Democratic voters showing up at the polls is Obama.
"As much as Id like to see it, that just wouldnt fly politically. His approach is the safest: [respect states decisions](http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/29/politics/holder-marijuana-laws/index.html?hpt=hp_t3), [tell banks to allow marijuana sales](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/14/marijuana-banking_n_4789893.html?1392404690), and of course [send first-time, nonviolent drug offenders to rehab instead of prison](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/414/send-first-time-nonviolent-drug-offenders-to-rehab/) ( or [flat out commute the sentences](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/19/obama-commutes-eight-drug-sentences/?hpt=hp_t2)"
"Its all a fucking scam, man. We are given the illusion that our votes matter and that our elected representatives are out for our best interests which, we all know, is complete bullshit."
"Ah yes, pot being illegal is holding back young blacks and Hispanics. Yep. "
"End the whole damn drug war, move all that money towards rehabilitating current prisoners (let all non violent drug offenders out first) "
Millions of young black men have had their career prospects ruined because of being caught with weed. That needs to end ASAP. 
Or charge the Koch Brothers with treason for a greater effect.
Its not a feeling. Its the truth. 
"And with a move like that, the next president could simply reclassify it back. This solves nothing."
"Disparities in sentencing based on race, yes, Id say it is."
"How long until people realize that the president isnt in control of the country? If there are billions of dollars being made, the president has no authority. He bows to the bankers, the MIC, drug lords, the NSA, etc..."
Thats one of many things that should be done. Luckily we dont have to advocate just one policy at a time. 
"This is political maneuvering to avoid the marijuana question. The fact is, all he needs to do is reclassify pot and expunge the records of low-level, non violent offenders. NOTHING else would benefit them more because now they will be able to: 1. Get a job because they wont be labeled a criminal anymore 2. Take out a loan to go to school 3. Take the stress off families with a husband or son in jail. 4. Completely pull the floor from gangs. I like Obama but I wish hed grow a fucking backbone and do the right thing. "
I cant shake the feeling that he could simply reclassify marijuana today and accomplish much of this at a fraction of the cost...
"Sorry, not possible today, pick the excuse (check all that apply): [ ] Defer to congress to pass a law doing it (let someone else take the flak) [ ] Its too soon to legalize weed (I dont want to be the weed president, I want to be the give everyone healthcare president) [ ] The president just simply doesnt have the power to control the DEA (Id love to help you, but its simply not in my power. Convenient.) [ ] Wed rather steal your cars, houses, and property under asset forfeiture laws than give you liberty. The schedule classification stands. [ ] We will create a review board to inspect the possibility of performing research possibly of the effects of cannabis. (Dont do shit for another 10 years, but act like were doing something. Still schedule 1 drug. Classification stands.) **Taking all bets!**"
"Seriously, Obama is just Reagan in a ~~civil whites~~ civil rights mask"
"Stole the words out of my mouth. Goddamn, if this werent the first thing I thought of. Thank you."

"Yes, there are some loopholes. But we are are AT LEAST still in the top five. http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/apr/25/leonard-lance/leonard-lance-claims-us-has-highest-corporate-tax-/ What does that mean for business here? "
"I guess you didnt read your own article. Loopholes and other special treatment for different kinds of businesses mean that businesses pay an effective rate of only 29.2% of their income, which puts the United States below the average of 31.9% among other major economies, according to analysis by the Treasury Department. "
"I wouldnt say its sky-high, its actually low all things considering. While we have the highest gun homicide rate in any first world country, it has been dropping at a fast rate and were around 4.2 per 100,000 people last time I checked."
facepalm indeed *sigh* why are americans so fucking stupid on the simple truth of what easy access to guns means in society? 
"Considering its been trending downwards for decades, Id say were doing fine."
"First, it wasnt I who counted school days vs calendar days. Try actually reading the links please. Second, there were 28 shootings last year in 180 school days for rates of .16 of a shooting per day or 7 shootings every 45 days. Of course Im not okay with any school shootings. My point is that its silly lazy and or dishonest to claim that 2014 already has a school shooting rate of one per 2 days. Third, the US has roughly the 18th highest gun violence rate per capita of all countries based on research done by politifact.com. My point here is not thats being 18th makes our numbers acceptable. My point is that you are making a strawman argument. Finally, this is my favorite one. Just like every other prohibitive law in the United States, the increase in the prohibitiveness of gun laws in the United States has a direct correlation to the amount of gun violence. Chicago is an excellent example of this. Restrictive gun laws will not help us. We must change the cultural attitude."
[deleted]
"you think the sky high insane US gun violence rate is acceptable, or just a matter of counting school days versus calendar days?! "
"I take exception to the fact that people spend billions of dollars and countless hours trying to ban guns instead of trying to figure out or address what actually *causes* the violence in the first place. Lets talk about poverty, income inequality, and the war on drugs before we act like we can just ban violence."
"That chart is for **income** taxes. The super wealthy arent living on **income**, they are earning money from investments, dividends, loans against stock options, routing their shell corporation profits through offshore accounts, and so forth. The tax rate on those forms of money is much lower. Even Warren Buffet said he pays a lower rate that his secretary: http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/index.html Key quote from the article: The top marginal tax rate also rose for the wealthiest wage earners, but since Buffetts income is from investment gains, not wages, thats not a factor. &gt;The rich pay higher percentages than the poor. Only on **income**. When youre the CEO of some multinational and making a nominal $500K a year but also get $200 million on stock options, other money classified as carried interest or dividends and so forth, you **arent** paying **income** taxes on the bulk of that money. So you actually end up paying a much much lower percentage. For example, Mitt Romney: http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/21/pf/taxes/romney-tax-return/index.html He paid about 15% taxes. That doesnt sync up too well with your claims. "
"I forgot to include my standard /r/politics disclaimer, didnt I? It is quite clear that you didnt read the report. If you did, you would realize that the source I gave **includes capital gains in its calculations.** Nice try, though! &gt;Even Warren Buffet said he pays a lower rate that his secretary Which cant be proven. What we *can* evauluate is a very similar statement by President Obama. He claimed that he paid a lower rate than a teacher making $50, 000 per year. Unfortunately, he was [lying](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/09/obamas-teacher-tax-whopper/). &gt;Only on **income** Nope. As Ive just explained, the CBO report includes all forms of compensation -- including capital gains. The rich still pay more. Much more. As for Mitt Romney, I dont care. I gave you overall statistics. Anecdotal evidence of a few outliers is irrelevant in a statistical discussion. "
"But income taxes are the only taxes that matter, because everything else doesnt fit the narrative. You also missed a pretty easy point in that the person making 500k doesnt pay payroll taxes on almost 80% of his income."
"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/debtlimit.asp Increasing Americas debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that the buck stops here. Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. -Barack Obama"
"Really? Im interested in reading more about that. Do you have a link? Frankly, the debt ceiling seems like a bad concept. If we already commit to spending the money, Congress shouldnt have to approve it again. "
"Youre right, which is why from 1979 to 1995 we didnt have this problem because of the [Gephardt rule.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling#Legislative_history) &gt; In 1979, noting the potential problems of hitting a default, Dick Gephardt imposed the Gephardt Rule, a parliamentary rule that deemed the debt ceiling raised when a budget was passed. This resolved the contradiction in voting for appropriations but not voting to fund them. The rule stood until it was repealed by Congress in 1995. Basically, if we voted to budget for items, we also voted to raise the debt ceiling to fund them, which made it so the U.S. couldnt potentially default on its debts. Then in 1995, the GOP eliminated the Gephardt rule, and then used the debt ceiling to shut down the government in 1996. "
The problem with the debt and the debt ceiling is inherent in our monetary system. Watch this video which can explain it much more eloquently than i can: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0

Spending increase has actually been nearly flat since 2009 however, and spending as a percentage of GDP as well as total spending adjusted for inflation has actually decreased since then. The deficit for 2013 is estimated to be about 42% of what it was in 2009."
"You got down voted for this post. People are painfully ignorant. These children want everything and arent the least bit concerned with where it comes from.

How on earth can we pay for the Affordable Care Act? We cant, plain and simple - and it isnt even that close."
"I think you have your facts backwards (the Republicans want to de-fund and delay full implementation), and youre also incorrect about your spending statement - federal spending is on the decline (and has been for a few years, after spiking last decade), though still quite high."
"It will halt new job production, that is irreperable harm. Companies are less likely to hire full time workers since they will be required to provide health insurance. Dont blame republicans, blame whoever spent all the money to begin with. This administration has spent more in the past 5 years than the last 100 years combined. Also, Obama has never passed a budget while in office, but since this new healthcare law will be going into effect soon, we need to know how the Govt plans to spend the taxes theyve collected. Republicans know repealing the law is impossible, but doing what the democrats want (stall healthcare implementation *another* year since enough taxes werent collected to pay for it and raising taxes is political suicide) is unacceptable when the taxes for the system have already been collected. Democrats want to wait another year to implement the bill, then it will be perfect. ie not a dem or rep, but lib"

Members of Congress, who currently get their insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) will instead have to purchase insurance through the exchanges. Nice try though."
"If Democrats are so sure Obamacare will be successful, why did the senate vote to exempt themselves from it?"

You can do all of the above and STILL not get the LAND A JOB part. Not that tough to understand.

How does one fill a job that doesnt exist? Economic reality is slamming into your theory.

&gt;What a wonderful way to prove that the president was at the time given support as well as a temporary free ride. You mean Bill Clinton? Who was the president at the time he made those statements.
"One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line. President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998 If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraqs weapons of mass destruction program. President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998 Iraq is a long way from USA but, what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face. Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998 He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983. Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998 We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.Constitution and Laws, to take necessary actions, (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs. Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998 Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998 Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies. Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999 There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue a pace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies. Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001 We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them. Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002 We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002 Iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power. Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002 We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction. Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002 The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons... Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002 I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security. Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002 There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002 He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002 In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002 We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002 Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating Americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real ... Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan.23.2003"

What a wonderful way to prove that the president was at the time given support as well as a temporary free ride. Some of his most vocal critics in the following years supported him because they believed what they were being told was true. I still think Cheney is evil. 
&gt; That was true for most people even though Faux tries to make it seem typical. lolwut? It was [Politifacts lie of the year](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/). 
"&gt;He specified that it was never an absolute promise He absolutely did promise it though. On over 30 occasions. Read the politifact article, they explain their reasoning in detail. Of course, you can try to spin it all you want."
"I do not deny that he screwed up but **for most people** it remains true, as I stated."
[deleted]
Im not sure what your point is...
"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/07/president-obama-continues-questionable-you-can-keep-your-health-care-promise/ He specified that it was never an absolute promise, and made the provisions required to make the assertion of Lie of the Year the most false claim presented. Every clarification Obama was supposed to make to make the statement not a lie, according to Politifact, was stated clearly, in 2009. Of course, you can cling to all the half truths you want. "
Yet politifact had rated it earlier as half true. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-under-his-health-care-law-those-/ lolwut? indeed. 
everyone not just conservative sources has admitted the ties between these companies and Obama. Hell the company that got the contract to create the healthcare site was headed by a woman who went to college and is good friends with Michelle Obama. Were not talking 9/11 conspiracy extrapolations here dude. 
[Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/whitley.asp) and [Factcheck](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/12/michelle-obama-and-cgi-federal/) both disagree with that particular bit of right-wing glurge. This is what happens when you get your news from right-wing chain letters.
Source? http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/benghazi.asp
And? Poor or missing information is something that has happened thruout history. 
"Im not saying it didnt, im not actually criticizing obama or anything. It happens and because of institutional reasons I dont know if its fixable or not. "
"Mistakes and poor communication are not the same as Obama let them die for political reasons and now is covering it up. Things dont always work perfectly. Expecting them to, and using every. single. situation where they dont as ammunition against your opponent, spun in horribly derogatory ways, is sickening and childish."
"well, one thing that did come out as true is that the CIA had live information of what was happening. This is important because the pentagon refused to send airborne support because they had no viable information such as who was leading it and such. If the CIA had just bothered to liaison with the pentagon the disaster might have been averted. "
"oh yeah, i understand that completely. Just one of those frustrations that should be fixed but for institutional reasons never does get fixed. "
"source for CIA in the city, though its not the best source in form of information. [CIA](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/10218288/CIA-running-arms-smuggling-team-in-Benghazi-when-consulate-was-attacked.html) and this is a source about the pentagon claim, though its partially editorialized and the comments are utter shit. It references the SecDef saying lack of information, though it also says that potentially it was an issue of having no resources within the 7-hour zone of benghazi. [Pentagon](http://m.nationalreview.com/corner/332168/why-was-answer-no-benghazi-bing-west) "
"Im not making any value statement. Just giving a couple numbers to obviously counter the 90% claim from above. That said, your first source to politifact is saying that many of the super rich live off investments and not necessarily income. While true, it still doesnt change the fact that the top 1% paid 37.4% of income taxes collected. &gt;This is disheartening considering that the 1% control roughly 35%[2] of the wealth. Without getting into my problems with that source and its methodology, going by their numbers they pay roughly the same percentage of the nations taxes as well. &gt;Lastly, the figure of 37.4% you stated is only income taxes, not all taxes like you state. I did say on income, although I suppose I could have worded it better."
"That he did. On income, [the top 1% in 2012 paid 37.4% of all taxes, while the bottom 95% paid 40.9%.](http://www.aei-ideas.org/2012/12/top-1-of-american-taxpayers-pay-almost-as-much-in-taxes-as-bottom-95-and-half-of-that-group-paid-nothing-in-2010/) That does not, however, take into account capital gains taxes, which are a significant part of the tax burden on the 1%. Although I dont have numbers on that, it seems pretty obvious that the 1% would pay more capital gains taxes than the bottom 95%. So, the 1% already pays a massive share of the taxes collected."
"True, the rich do pay more in capital gains taxes because they do have more investments. But you are forgetting some other important taxes such as payroll. Payroll taxes disproportionately affect the poor compared to the rich. With that in mind, it is estimated that the rich actually pay [less taxes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/18/warren-buffett/warren-buffett-says-super-rich-pay-lower-taxes-oth/) as a percentage compared to the rest of the country. This is disheartening considering that the 1% control [roughly 35%](http://www.businessinsider.com/charts-on-us-inequality-2013-11?op=1) of the wealth. Lastly, the figure of 37.4% you stated is only income taxes, not *all* taxes like you state. Keep in mind that income snapshots of the top 1% dont really give the whole picture. The bottom of the 1% is made up of professionals such as lawyers and doctors. They are the ones that mostly make up the income tax figures on these sources. The upper portion of the 1% dont have normal jobs and dont really pay income taxes as compared to the wealth they bring in. "
"Yeah, Im really hating my lower property taxes, a state budget surplus, and steadily improving employment numbers. *Really* sucks."
"Lets take a look at a bit wider data set than one isolated week... &gt;* Wisconsin ranked 21st in total private sector jobs created from December 2011 to 2012 with a gain of 32,282. Wisconsin?s total private sector job gain outpaces Iowa, and jumped 11 spots in percentage of private sector job growth to 33rd highest at 1.4 percent, higher than neighboring Illinois. &gt;* Wisconsin ranked 21st in total job gains with a jump of 31,902 from December 2011 to 2012, outpacing Iowa, and ranked 31st highest in percentage of total job gains at 1.2 percent. &gt;* Wisconsin ranked 12th in weekly wage growth over the year, which is second highest in the Midwest. http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2013/130627_qcew.pdf Looking at 2013: &gt;* Wisconsin ranks 19th in private sector job growth from December 2012 to December 2013 based on preliminary December federal BLS Current Employment Statistics (CES)job totals. &gt;* Wisconsin ranks 3rd in manufacturing job growth from December 2012 to December 2013 based on preliminary December CES job totals. &gt;* Wisconsins unemployment rate is 6.2 percent, below the national rate and the states lowest December rate since December 2007 and the lowest rate for any month since November 2008. &gt;* Initial unemployment claims on an annual basis are at lowest level in 12 years, and continued claims, lowest in six years. http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2014/unemployment/140129_january_local.pdf "
Improving employment numbers? Didnt Wisconsin have the most new unemployment claims in February?
"So youve got a citation to back up your claim that the poor and uneducated, even though they vote Democratic for presidential elections, take a huge u-turn and vote Republican in state elections?"
"I absolutely love how any report that has an outlook that flies in the face of the liberal agenda pushed here is automatically attacked as a partisan lie. What is infinitely more ridiculous is that you dont even offer any statistics or data as a source to prove it. Ill assume the irony of that is completely lost on you. [Lets look at the states](https://www.statescape.com/resources/partysplits/partysplits.aspx) and where they land economically. [CNBCs ranking for the top states for business](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100824779) lists only one Democratic controlled state (Colorado) in the top ten, while pulling in 7 of the bottom 10 states. Looking a Moodys Analytics forcast for 2014, the only Democratic controlled states in the top ten are [Oregon and Colorado](http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/which-states-will-generate-jobs-in-2014-85899531072), while there are only 2 Republican controlled states in the bottom 10 (Alaska and Tennessee). Those numbers are right in line with [Rich States, Poor States](http://i.imgur.com/MJqFAF6.jpg), which ranked only one Democrate controlled state in the top 15 (Nevado). (The [full report](http://alec.org/docs/RSPS-6th-Edition?utm_source=Main+alec+site&amp;utm_medium=RSPS+Download+page&amp;utm_campaign=RSPS+Download+calculator) is here.) Welfare expenditure is a pretty good indicator of how a states economy is performing, so well pick that. [Here is a list of states and the amount they spend per capita on Welfare](http://www.statemaster.com/graph/eco_wel_cas_tot_fam_percap-caseloads-total-families-per-capita). And would you look at that! Excluding Guam and DC, only 5 of the top 15 states are red. Further, [when you look at welfare spending as a percentage of GDP](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/compare_state_spending_2014p40S) red states make up only 4 of the top 15. What about unemployment? Well, lets look at that as well. [Looking at the numbers](http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm), Blue states only have 3 in the top 15, and have 8 in the bottom 15 (including the bottom 4, all at 8% or more). Gee, its funny how, the more you look at the numbers, the more you see red states continually beating out the blue states when you look at the numbers beyond the superficial and misleading surface. Still interested in reality? "
"You present a strong argument good sir. I would think someone of your character would be above using words like liberal agenda. Its the political equivalent of yo mama. In regards to your first point, your claim that a good state for business equals a strong economy does not ring bells with me. A good state for business could also mean a good state for companies to take advantage of workers and dont have to pay equitable tax shares, or are more free of government regulations (such as environmental). You dont have to agree with me, just something for consideration. If I were to bring a new company into my city, I want a company with a strong union, high wages and benefits, contributes financially to the community in proportion to its rewards. I believe that is a stronger indicator of economic strength than how much profit a company can make. Which is really what good for business means, potential for profitability. Your second point, welfare is a good indicator of economic strength, may not be a universally accepted norm. [see here](http://www.unc.edu/~jdsteph/documents/common/chapters/WS%20&amp;%20Econ.pdf). Welfare rates as a measure of GDP or per capita has more to do with coverage levels, access, and local economies. Only one of those variables is directly correlated with a states economic strength. And I dont know what your personal stance on politicfact is, but there is this [analysis!](http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/28/occupy-democrats/pro-democrat-group-says-9-10-poorest-states-are-re/) Basically stating 9/10 red states are the most poor as a true statement. The person making the original statement is biased, but the data they pulled from is not. Now listen, I understand sources and data. Please understand that there are a plethora of sources citing data both ways. Please dont assume everyone that doesnt think like you or has accessed the same sources or put their faith in the same data as you as subscribing to a liberal agenda. You brought up some good points. But its not a matter of you being a bloody genius and your information is the holy be all of data and all conservative/republicans are great and all liberal/democrats are idiot sheep. Your red states are only economically stronger by the measures you chose to use and the data you chose to use. I chose a different set of data. "
"&gt;you are being partisan as fuck. Please tell me what part of my comments were partisan. Did you even read that article? The Mostly False rating is based on Rushs comment that Sebelius was the sole decision maker and that she decided whether Sarah lived or died. Not that she had the ability to waive the policy. In fact, politifact stated that :Sebelius did have the power to overrule the age requirements of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network -- the entity that oversees transplants in the United States. The appeal was brought to Sebelius. She denied it. Then was forced to waive it under the ruling of a federal judge. &gt;Reality has a liberal bias Oh. Youre one of those people. I understand now."
"&gt;...oh, so she didnt want the government to interfere and preferred to stay out of it? The transplant policy was put in place by the government with medical expert cooperation. Sebelius bowed to the policy that was put in place with their input. However, it is a government policy, so a government official intervening would not be the government interfering, but the government waiving a policy they put in place. Hence the reason Sarah needed to appeal to Sebelius to be put on the list. This wasnt a case of doctors saying no. It was a case of the doctors saying yes, but the government policy and Sebelius saying no. &gt;You really need to stop listening to partisan attacks and sharing their talking points. Excuse me? I didnt give you partisan talking points. I laid out the facts of the case you were asking for. Yes, the person who you replied to was rather hyperbolic in his framing of Sebelius, but the fact remains that she was a step in the girls appeal process to get on the transplant list, and Kathleen denied the appeal. Perhaps you should start looking into things for yourself instead of dismissing any information you dont like as partisan attacks. "
"Still wrong, you are being partisan as fuck. Probably should check your facts first. Reality has a liberal bias, get used to it. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/11/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-hhs-secretary-kathleen-sebelius/"

"&gt;havent realized yet that presidential power is really quite limited. Obama apparently hasnt realized it either, if you look at his list of executive orders."
"All 168 of them? Not only is Obama far from the most prolific user of executive orders, at this point he?s not even on pace to surpass President George W. Bush?s total. In fact, unless he picks up speed, Obama will likely sign fewer executive orders than any two-term president since the start of the 20th century. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-barack-obama-has-signed-1000-ex/"
Yet they do nothing besides cut entitlement programs which are a drop in the bucket compared to military budgets. 
1. We do not spend more on the military than we do on entitlements. That is an oft repeated myth. [factcheck](http://origin.factcheck.org/Images/image/2011/Articles/Fiscal%20FactCheck/2010%20Pie%20Chart.png) Beware graphs that talk about discretionary spending. 2. I consider some level of military spending to keep my family safe as an entitlement program 
Some level. Exactly but do we need to spend as much as the [top 13](http://i.imgur.com/KyferxZ.gif) combined? (not that this chart has us spending 711 billion while the 2014 budget is ~800 billion. [Source](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/fed_spending_2014USrn))
Mccain was born in panama
On a naval base. 
"Technically born on US territory and jurisdiction, which is part of the natural born clause. Alberta does not fall under either category. This is a common issue for military children, but that doesnt apply to Cruz. http://www.snopes.com/politics/mccain/citizen.asp Says its undetermined. "
Its almost like its an insurance program....
"Except that the [average worker receives more in benefits from SS than he pays in, even when adjusting for investment interest and inflation](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/01/medicare-and-social-security-what-you-paid-what-yo/). This makes SS closer to charity than insurance."
The primary intent of the ACA wasnt to lower insurance cost for those who have it. It was to ensure basic affordable coverage is available to all. If you had a qualifying health plan prior to the ACA there is no incentive for the insurance companies to lower your cost (that I know of)
Obama promised me my insurance rates would go down. Obama lied to me. Again. http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/15/ron-johnson/obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-havent-gone-do/
"&gt;Yea, ~~Obama~~ Politicians [are] professional liar[s]. If anyone doesnt realize this theyre not paying attention."
"Yea, Obama is a professional liar. If anyone doesnt realize this theyre not paying attention. "
http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/ Hardly a professional when you compare to an A-League player like http://www.politifact.com/personalities/michele-bachmann/
Well yeah hes a politician. 
What did you say? I wasnt paying attention.
Yes but like all politicians he is a professional liar. No need to single him out or demonize him.
"Since weve never had a president thats served a full term thats done everything they said during their campaign, been able to accomplish every one of their stated goals, or not made at least a few decisions that history didnt look back on later as mistakes... Is it within the realm of possibility that being president is legitimately extremely difficult and many of the choices you have to make as president are ones where both choices are different degrees of bad? I think skepticism is good, but the extreme cynicism lots of people have concerning politics I feel sometimes prevents them from ever acknowledging the nature of the job"
I would say all politicians are professional liars.
Id also like to see that against a number of graduates in each year. In other words... there are a lot of reasons for it. Id also like to see that go back another hundred years to see price changes.
"Not nearly this expensive. Its several times more than what it used to be, even taking into account inflation. http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact%2Fphotos%2FGS.41FACT107.jpg"
Im not sure what education youre referring to. University-level education has always been expensive. 
You seem to not realize that the northern states dont simply have all the money. Nor are northern states free of the people you are attributing to the south. Are you going to force all the blacks to move north? Your idea is not a very good or practical one honestly.
"&gt;You seem to not realize that the northern states dont simply have all the money. [Actually, they do.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/26/blog-posting/red-state-socialism-graphic-says-gop-leaning-state/) Its the red states that scream no welfare while getting their hands full of Uncle Sams money."
"How is that not fiscal responsibility, you say you want something and then you go out and make the sacrifice (work harder or cutback elsewhere) to get what you want. The party of fiscal responsibility wants low taxes but doesnt have the balls to actually make meaningful cuts. Ultimately meaning that the Republicans and Libertarians just want to be a bunch of social parasites upon the taxpayers."
&gt; Democrats increase government spending and raise taxes I dont call that fiscally responsible. I get your point but that is not fiscal responsibility. You cant keep doing that over a long period of time. What is the end game? When I finally hand over 100% of my earnings and trust the government to spend it wisely? Please. Edit: BTW you should look into the so-called Clinton surplus. There never was such a thing.
"&gt;BTW you should look into the so-called Clinton surplus. There never was such a thing. [Yes, there definitely was.](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/) There are two common criticisms of the balanced-budget claim, the first is that the budget would not have been balanced if it werent for Social Security running a surplus in its separate budget; and the other is that the government uses an accounting scheme different from corporations. Neither of those actually affect the claim of a surplus (though they do affect the *amount*). &gt;&gt;But even if we remove Social Security from the equation, there was a surplus of $1.9 billion in fiscal 1999 and $86.4 billion in fiscal 2000. So any way you count it, the federal budget was balanced and the deficit was erased, if only for a while. [...] &gt;&gt;But even under accrual accounting, the annual reports showed surpluses of $69.2 billion in fiscal 1998, $76.9 billion in fiscal 1999, and $46 billion for fiscal year 2000. So even if the government had been using that form of accounting the deficit would have been erased for those three years."
But the reason there appeared to be no deficit (or a surplus even) was because the government simply starting borrowing shit loads of money. The public debt did go down but the intra-governmental holdings went up. According to the US Treasury there was still a huge national debt.
Tax and spend is not working harder or cutting back elsewhere and it also assumes that we all want to increase social programs. What you are describing sounds like responsibility. That is not tax and spend.
Consider me *somewhat skeptical* http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/factchecking-health-insurance-premiums/
"Mine has doubled over the last ten years, because we werent on a group plan and because Blue X could."
I understand your skepticism but I notice that the first graph on that link shows (if Im not mistaken) that single premiums like mine increased at the same time Obama took office which supports what I said previously. My premiums had never changed in the six years prior. Not only have they increased since 2009 but I have to do yearly physicals and health assessments and other things that I didnt have to do before. 
"&gt; Before the ACA, folks had their rates jacked year after year Not mine. Mine never got jacked up until the panic over Obama wanting to implement health care set in."
"You can check the recent BLS statistics, or even [politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/08/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-about-2-percent-americans-get-pai/). There are plenty of arguments against the increase in minimum wage (I for one am against raising the min. wage), but inflation is not one of them. "
"Do you have a source saying that only 3.6 million Americans make minimum wage? Also, since $10.10/hour is currently much higher than most people in the lower income bracket make, will that not create a large percentage of new minimum wage workers or are you assuming that they will all see a percentage wage increase to match?"
You know the guys on the other side of the aisle are much worse -- some of them are insane -- and they are blocking any progress every step of the way.
"I dont know why people expect the president to be able to just wiggle his fingers and make all of his personal dreams come true. Our govt is a very complex machine with many cogs, and if just one part doesnt want to work the whole thing gets busted. Nothing gets done because too many parts dont line up."
" he wouldnt have been fucking ejected, without the the money, love to see you get into office without big donors."
"So, yeah, about that didnt act on anything he campaigned on part: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-kept/"
"Im stunned I had to go so far down the page before someone mentioned anything negative about the fact that he himself is guilty of this bullshit. Hes failed to act on nearly everything he campaigned on. I voted for him a first time, strongly against him on the second and despise him now.

"&gt;I dont know if 10 percent of the Russian governments income comes from the sale of vodka. I dont know if a cow can go upstairs, but not downstairs. And I certainly dont know if a ducks quack doesnt echo. &gt;But I do know the following statement is false: The Eisenhower Interstate Highway System requires that one mile in every five must be straight. These straight sections are usable as airstrips in times of war or other emergencies. [One Mile in Five: Debunking the Myth](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/00mayjun/onemileinfive.cfm), Richard F. Weingroff, *Public Roads* Vol. 63? No. 6 May/June 2000, Federal Highway Administration. ----- &gt;Belief in this crazy idea should fail anyones logic test. It makes no sense to render inoperable the Interstate highway system during times of domestic crisis ? moving troops and supplies on the ground would be too important an activity to curtail just to land planes. The U.S. is riddled with any number of small, private airfields that could be pressed into service if the need arose, with that need being dependent on some foreign power having first knocked out an almost uncountable number of major airports plus those airstrips on military bases, not to mention the American fleet of aircraft carriers. Folks who commit to believing this crazy notion of highways doubling by design as airstrips are letting the romance of a cool fact blind them to what their common sense should be blinking at them in bright neon letters. [Interstate Highways as Airstrips](http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/airstrip.asp), Barbara strip mauled Mikkelson, snopes.com, April 1, 2011."
"Good work. Although, the interstate system does still have thousands of miles of usable runway, regardless of whether its part of the design."
"Sure, we can even stick with Politifact as the [source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/barack-obama/obamas-plan-expands-existing-system/). Note that in October of 2008 they had this statement as bury the needle true. Also note that he specifically states that not only could people keep their plans if they liked them, the ACA would also lower the premiums of those plans. He even states that the number one selling point of the ACA is the idea that if you like your plan you can keep it. &gt;Number 1, let me just repeat, if youve got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it, Obama said. All Im going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. Youll still have choice of doctor. Is that a good enough source for you? "
"This is not the number one reason why the program was implemented, it is the first response to a claim that people would lose their plans. It is absurd to claim that ACA was passed so people could keep their existing health care plans. "
&gt; because he actually campaigned on the lie about the ACA as one of its major selling points? Citation? I thought the selling point was providing insurance to the uninsured. 
"While true, I cant blame him too much. Then there is a majority in one of the houses of Congress will go against their own principles to oppose just because you name is on it, and *absolutely refuse to compromise in any way*, theres not much you can do. I think without the Republican house he still wouldnt have lived up to his promises, I get the feeling he would have at least been closer. Therefore I think more blame lies with the problems in Congress than himself. "
&gt;over keeping the promises that he ran on in 2008 and 2012. You mean after his party lost more seats in 2010 they had even less power to do anything? And the appointment of the FCC people talked about here was done to appease Republicans who blocked all nominations? Oh and about those promises... http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/ You are full of shit!
This FCC corporate shill is a perfect example of the damage President Obama has magnified in this country by favoring political expediency and capitulation over keeping the promises that he ran on in 2008 and 2012. Such poor decisions will ultimately tarnish what could have been a spectacular Presidency and legacy.
Well I do love in it. I just dont care what crazy people think.

Its just a matter of redistricting."
Stealing votes. Dont give them any credit 
48.03% is still a ton of votes though.
Yet they keep getting tons of votes. : (

"First, tarp will actually lose money.

If thats the case, why do republicans/libertarians insist those on welfare are moochers and could get a job no problem if they werent so lazy? "
"Like VelvetElvis said: it prevented another great depression. i.e. a soft rebound from the recession. Jobs back to pre-recession levels, moderate economic growth, and not massive job losses, catastrophic business failures and negative growth. It could have been much, much worse. It also could have been much better if the stimulus had been bigger with increased spending on education and infrastructure creating JOBS. But the GOP killed it, and hence the anemic growth out of the recession. "
OOOOO k.....it was wasted and now we have a govt bloated to hell and ZERO growth and no jobs
My god....you rubes will believe anything fed to you by leftotards Obama created this zombie bank hell while trampling individual freedoms left and right. There are no jobs.....all gains due to reduction of labor force participation rate and NO growth. Enjoy morons.
Not all the GOPs problem here. Obama has publicly stated his unwillingness to negotiate on many things. Being able to appoint any judge he desires to rule anything he wants as consitutional is a huge danger to our society. No limit to what he can pass. Obama and Reid were the biggest critics of this when the repubs even discussed doing that. I wouldnt even want someone that shares my political views to have that kind of power.
"&gt; Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and theyre sure trying to do so, its going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they cant and wont compromise. I know, Ive tried to deal with them. -- Barry Goldwater Unfortunately, the sentiment of compromise is lost on the current Republican party."
History fail. Come up out of your parents basement and look around once in a while.
"Why are you allergic to the truth? http://www.factcheck.org/2013/06/obamas-judicial-juggling/ Dems *DID NOT* come to an agreement. In some categories they treated Bushs nominees worse than Republicans are treating Obamas nominees. Youre simply ignoring the facts because they arent beneficial to your team. For example: &gt;Circuit Courts of Appeals: Obama?s appeals court judges waited an average of 240.2 days between nomination and confirmation during his first term; Bush?s waited an average of 277.0 days during his first term, the longest of any recent president."
nice job responding is such a mature manner. lol 
When it comes to stalling nominees the GOP has the worst track record as of late. The Dems came to an agreement with the Bush administration on a number of nominees while the Republicans spit on such ideas. The GOP has been by far the most obstructionist of both parties.
nope. I remembered wrongly. My mistake
"Thank God, the Democrats have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they arent fit to govern, time to clean this joint up at mid terms."

How dare he try to help educate kids properly! Burn him! 
http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/jeb-bush-biggest-nightmare-common-core Why Jeb Bushs Greatest Political Achievement Could Sink a White House Run 
If you define greatest as meaning the thing with the most impact - that would have been fixing the election in Florida (and therefore the entire country) for his brother in 2000.
"[Factchecking common core, just a little of the nonsensical disinformation from Republicans.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/oct/21/fact-checking-common-core-school-standards/) It would be amusing if Republican lies sink Jebs chances, but somehow I dont think the country would elect another Bush yet. The people behind the objections really dont want public schools to become better. It interferes with their plans to destroy public education and replace it with voucher schools. "
"Its the Bush name. Fool me once shame on me, Fool me twice oh wait hows that go again..."
"RINOs generally do win elections -- for the opposing party. Jeb is, in that sense, a winner."
Anything that keeps Americans out out of the educated job market is fine by me. thanks to the dumbing down of America and the HB1 visa program my kids will always have good paying jobs.
"* Supports Common Core - in fact, is one of its founding fathers * Supports immigration reform * Refused to endorse Tea Party fav Rubio over more liberal Crist * Reused to sign Grover Nordquists No new taxes pledge * Last name: Bush Yeah, this guy s going nowhere."
"Can you give an example? This is news to me if true. Maybe politifact should run a politifact article on if politifact can be trusted? I read through this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com#Criticism_of_specific_fact_checks And while I accept some of the criticisms of them, with how many articles they publish Im not sure that shows a pattern of intentional dishonesty. "
"Yet another example of false equivalence in the media of America, trying to pretend that theres some equality between how much Democrats and Republicans lie and about what. Republicans make shit up completely out of thin air and are treated as if they have facts on their side. They lie so often that no fact-checking organization can even keep up with them. So how is it PolitiFact consistently pulls shit like claiming the biggest lie of a year was a Democrat claiming Republicans want to kill social security, when thats been the entire partys stated goal for decades now."
Can we stop posting Politifact? They are genuinely awful and get a mind-blowing number of things wrong.
"The meme is a bit obnoxious, but other than that it doesnt seem all that hard to fact-check such a statement. So in this particular case, what are the mind-blowing number of things wrong?"
"How much exactly did Halliburton profit from the war? Not saying they didnt profit, I just havent come across any actual numbers yet"
No doubt Cheney declined to mention that as well. 
"you mean like how you turds claimed Bush controlled gas prices? How Halliburton did? Im not a political major but when I remove myself from major media I do know Obama and Bush are about even this very second on public approval, yet one race approved one, then the other....... Did we lose the racism factor today or gain the educated? This country needs to wake up! "
"Well 9/11 certainly worked out well for Halliburton, didnt it."
"and KBR, which was a Halliburton subsidiary at the time. "
"It worked out for a lot of people...does anyone think its purley coincidental that before the 9/11 attacks the following activity was going on: Huge surges in purchases of put options on stocks of the two airlines used in the attack -- United Airlines and American Airlines Surges in purchases of put options on stocks of reinsurance companies expected to pay out billions to cover losses from the attack -- Munich Re and the AXA Group Surges in purchases of put options on stocks of financial services companies hurt by the attack -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., and Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Huge surge in purchases of call options of stock of a weapons manufacturer expected to gain from the attack -- Raytheon Huge surges in purchases of 5-Year US Treasury Notes Cmon people???"
"Sorry to burst your bubble, but Cheney divested himself of all financial interests in Halliburton before the wars started: http://www.factcheck.org/kerry_ad_falsely_accuses_cheney_on_halliburton.html **Edit:** 1. Write truthful statement in comment 2. Provide link to statement for verification 3. No one provides any evidence that disputes it 4. Watch as my comment is downvoted to oblivion! 5. Stay classy, Reddit"
"you want more, start a war..."
AFAIK when Cheney went into the WH - it was set up so that he would receive tons of deferred income from Halliburton after he was no longer in office - and now he is probably reaping full benefits once again.
"Billions an billions of dollars, and it keep rolling in with those no-bid contracts. Too bad about our kids and all those poor Iraqis in the wrong spot at the wrong time. Best part? First day in office President Obama says we are looking forwards, not back. Now we have banks providing financial logistical support to the very people we are supposedly at war with...and nothing happens. Military Industrial Complex aint got nothing to fear."
"Hey, on our watch, we were always ready .... *to make some money*"
They made 39.5 billion dollars of our money on that war.
"Im doubting the reliability. They make a point that the flight was in violation of the flight ban, but the flights were [after the flight ban had been lifted](http://www.snopes.com/rumors/flights.asp)."
&gt; This is a well-documented fact. It is a well-debunked myth.

I remember it clearly. There was one civilian flight in the US on Sep 12. It was the evacuation of the bin Ladens.
Does anyone not remember how literally the day or two after 9/11 the many Bin Laden family members in the US at the time were flown out of the country without having to undergo any sort of questioning by the CIA? This is a well-documented fact.
But...but..the Saudis are our friends and allies! Surely..no..it couldnt be!!!
"Why would the family members if Osama bin Laden need to be questioned? They were all westernized playboys and models who live in Zurich and Riyahd. Half the family was in the US to gamble in Vegas, attend an investor conference, visit Disneyland and shop in Beverly Hills. They have less to do with an estranged uncle than you do with any of your distant relatives. Would the police question you if a cousin you hadnt seen in 20 years committed a crime?"
Bin Laden had been a well-known terrorist for at least a decade prior to 9/11. Theres no way his family in the US hadnt been investigated up the wazoo for years.
[deleted]
I honestly forgot all about that until reading this. But I do remember.
&gt; Theres no way his family in the US hadnt been investigated up the wazoo for years. Sure theres a way: friends in high places in the US.
&gt; Why would the family members if Osama bin Laden need to be questioned? Because they were his family members. The US is holding prisoners all over the world without trial for much less cause.
They didnt have anything to do with it and were going to be attacked just because of their name. Thats enough reason to take them out of the country 
Nope. Not a fact.
Not really. They spent 3 days under FBI protective custody and flown out of the country when the general grounding was lifted. 
That was one of the first things I learned that *really* raised my eyebrows. I hadnt even begun to question the official narrative of that day yet but I can definitely say learning that really didnt sit right with me.
[Here](http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091301flight#a091301flight) is a page with many links from reliable sources 
"Within a couple hours of 9/11 people were pointing fingers at Bin Laden on the news. We knew he was behind the USS Cole and we knew he wanted to attack United States assets, we just didnt have specific intel. "
Source?
[deleted]
"Im positive that the Bin Laden family was even *more* displeased with Osama after 9/11 for just that reason. He was persona non grata with the family for years beforehand - the children of a billionaire construction magnate typically want nothing to do with the kid thats topping out the FBIs most-wanted list. Then, all of a sudden, this catastrophe goes down in the USA and Osama is implicated. The safety of the Bin Laden family members in the USA is now compromised, and The Bin Ladens very simply have the connections that will get them out of country, and I dont care what anyone says about it. I hate the conspiratorial implications in this story. I mean seriously - this grand conspiracy supposedly goes down, all air traffic is halted, and *then* the high-profile Bin Ladens get their special trip out of the country? Give me a break. Im just some dummy sitting in a sports bar and I would have evacuated the Bin Ladens a month beforehand."

How does Boehner not clap on the point that people should vote? Cmon dude.
DAE notice Biden has a glass of water and Boehner has a complete toiletry set.
So far her speech is about HER and not Americans. Shes losing me.
whats that silver thing in front of Boehner?
"Wow, the republican response couldnt have been filled with more zealotry. "
"Advance summary: * Good thing * Good thing * Good thing * (pause for applause) * Good thing * Good thing * Appeal to special accomplishment * (standing ovation) * Face new challenges * Promise * Promise * Promise * Vow to work together * (applause) * USA is great, Thank-you Very Much, and God Bless the United States of America * (Applause, photo ops, drinking begins)"
Republicans and Democrats agree: Michelles pretty okay. 
"So funny, Lindsy Graham was nodding in agreement and then he realized the camera was on him and he stopped. "
Boehners a Mad Men fan huh?
Did he really just say MyRA?
"dear congress: stay the hell away from iran sanctions until we done negotiating, ya bums love, obama + kerry"
Is Biden texting? 
"The President just mentioned my hometown of Youngstown, Ohio. So I got that going for me, which is nice."
and this has nothing to do with anything...who let her talk?
The sad thing is that many people will love this woman because shes talking about god and how great he is.
I wish I could be in Bidens head sometimes. He looks like hes having fun.

"Why does the GOP think talking down to the American people is effective. It just makes me not respect what shes saying. And the swallowing noises, JESUS! DRINKS SOME WATER"
John Boehner looks absolutely miserable.
"What I find interesting is that millions upon millions of Americans will refuse to listen to what our president has to say tonight, yet those very same Americans will flood the internet with comments about what he had to say. Go figure!"
"10th deployment, holy shit."
Give America a raise. Nice.
Anyone else treating this like the game threads in the sports subreddits?
It is time to do away with work place policies that belong on the show mad men. Nice
And theres the NSA reference.
I think Im going to die from listening to all these cliches.
"$700 a month premium increase. Yeah, Im calling bullshit on that. "
Best line of the night: Why go through 40 more votes to repeal a law that is already a LAW BOOM!
Anyone else catch that woman fist pumping?
Someone PLEASE make a GIF of Boehner giving the thumbs up!
"so is she just going to ramble on about her family with strong Christian overtones, or is she going to actually speak about an actual issue?"
How is Boehner darker than Obama???
Is Biden texting?
. Gif of excited Biden?

Why is Boehner darker than Obama? 
I see Speaker Boehner went with the mahogany shade of spray-on tan tonight. 
WTF am I listening to?
"Say what we are for, not just what we are against Great, now they have until the end of the speech to re-write theirs in a hurry."
Lower tax rates for companies that actually create jobs.. now there might be an actual incentive. 
Whats the next thing Biden will pull out of his pocket?
Standing Ovation status: badass veteran deserves this one.
"Her speech was vague, did not hit any relevant points, did not offer any alternative ideas, and became religious at the end. I found it to be an exceptionally weak speech that ostracized a lot of people with the prayer at the end. Edit for clarity: Her = Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash)"
"The true State of the Union lies in your heart. WTF? GOP taking its writing cues from the Wizard of Oz? It was in you all along... Seriously - why does the current GOP speech writing sound like a mix of Hallmark, Disney, and FOX News?"
If the future of the Republican party is represented by what im watching in the Republican response this party is over. Nothing of any substance was said in that. 
I really like the MyRA concept. Lets see how much of a reality it becomes.

Nothing like the yearly hour of rhetoric and promises no one intends to keep.

"Make sure you sort by new, and refresh every so often"
"Man, everybody in here is complaining but hes better than Republicans and if they werent constantly getting in the way cause they cant wait to get in a womans vagina to put rape babies there wed be living the dream.

I have a feeling this is going to be one of his best campaign speeches ever. Hes going to be brutal and call out a lot of the bull shit going on in congress. Shots will be fired and the bar brawl leading up to the mid terms will begin tonight. Hes going to try to take away everything the GOP has been posturing to adopt as their rebranding strategy. Hes got nothing to lose at this point.

Drink every time he lies
Does CNN have to talk over everything?
2 questions: 1: Is there a VLC stream? 2: Is there an official drinking game thread and can someone please direct me to it if there is?

I love when they talk about the Congresspeople who have waited hours to stand along entrance row.
Is the Duck Dynasty dude wearing a camo suit? 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg looks haggard. 
How drunk do you think Boehner is going to be?
"damn, that guy next to michelle is creepin on her"
"Ok, anyone else catch the fact that they misspelled televised and claimed that Theodore Roosevelt gave a State of the Union address in 1941?"
This is the Academy Awards...for dorks. 
"Eric Holder is thinking shit, I hope, Kerry doesnt smell my weed."
Anyway else having trouble connecting to the webchat?

Fucking Duck Dynasty is here? Wtf?
"Im sorry, do we have duck dienasty in the audience? How embarrassing. "
You can watch a live stream via Washington Post [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics-live/liveblog/live-updates-state-of-the-union/?hpid=z1).

"That lady has one hell of a snazzy jacket. Shine on, lady, shine on. "
Does anyone *really* give a flying fuck what lies blowbama has to say tonight? Really? 
Pleeeeease let us hear all these chats. 
SOTU takes so long to get going.
Obama is dappin the fuck outta these people
"Now that Obama has nothing to lose, [this](http://mlkshk.com/r/N5BI) is how I hope the speech goes down. "
Am I crazy or does the Potus look hyped up like hes going into a wrestling match?
I think they should just cancel the whole thing and have a nerd gun fight.
Chris Matthews wants to kiss Maddow so badly.
Whats goin on man? Hows it goin brotha? Good to see ya buddy! I love this guy.

Cantor? The fuck is he there?
Who is the sketchy character looking like a seasoned murderer seemingly gaurding the president!?
I just realized how much fucking pressure there is from the second he comes into the room. One faux pas and itll make headlines... he must psych himself up as hes riding over. 
What if one person he shuck hands with has the flu. Everyone there would get the flu.
You just gave him a 10 minute standing ovation. Getting introduced requires another one?
There are pictures of boobs in those envelopes he just handed Boehner and Biden.
Its... happening..?
Standing ovation count: just getting started.
Standing ovations... the commercials of the SOTU
This is painful already
Fun fact: The GOP are only clapping ironically
Not one of these speak 2 sentences and clap kind of speeches again! ugh.
anyone wanna take bets on how long until Joey B nods off? dudes looking beat. 
*Low paying part time jobs
hahaha bone tired
"Standing ovation count: wait, we were still in a war?"
CNN just went unavailable during the SOTU on Time Warner
Is it just me or do a lot of people look like they dont even want to be there. Specifically Boehner
[deleted]
Standing ovation count: Chinas working conditions are starting to make ours look bad.
[deleted]
"How long before Biden falls asleep? I wonder how many times he heard this speech rehearsed. And Jesus, has Boehner been drinking? He looks extra red. "
"Oh god, our wages are going to sink to the level of Chinas?"
*manufacturers actively considering moving back from china to us* lol
"My feed keeps cutting out after about a minute and a half, anyone else having this problem? Is there another feed which is more reliable?"
"Today a teacher in Chicago sat home, today an entrepreneur didnt build that..more people out of work than ever, and the deficits are higher under Obama than ever...and so it goes lie, after lie, after lie "
What did Boehner say on his hot mic just before Obama handed them those envelopes? Did anyone hear?
SOTU: Things are awesome in America!
He also left out the part about a vet kills himself because he cant get any help at the VA. A person whos been cut back to part time was just evicted. A college grad heated up Ramen Noodles because he cant afford normal food while paying his student loan interest.
Obama might as well turn around and look Boehner in the eye right now. 
Watching this on Youtube. Error every minute. I dont know what I was expecting...

"The first mention of republicans, Obama thanked republicans for their bipartisan effort. Lets see if the republican response is that gracious "
"oh man, i bet you could have heard a pin drop on the right side of the aisle after he mentioned the government shutdown"
Whoo more money we need to spend on education.
Obama: Penis. *Thunderous applause.*
This is pretty hard not to like so far.
Patty Murray looks like my elementary school music teacher. Patty Murray looks like *everyones* elementary school teacher. 
Are we calling it the great recession now?
Love the tea party guffawing after Obamas dig regarding the debt ceiling
"If you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead in America. I can get behind that! "
Can we at least listen to the SOTU with an even head and then criticize what he says? 
Without legislation
Lonely guy clapping in the back.
Im hoping to hear about 50 executive orders
Prez sez: More executive powerzz!!!
Exexcutive action VS DEA...... FIGHT
Using the State of the Union to get brownie points. Atta Boy Obama!
please stop honking michelles bobo - what a weakling
It was definitely either the Get Fit campaign or the fact that people are too broke to buy food.
He cant even get one full sentence out without the clapping.
Whos the man sitting on Michelles right?
[deleted]
Who are the people sitting next to Michell 
Whats in front of Boehner? Salt shakers? 
"Great, now there will be another pro-obesity in children push. "
"I love how he said the kids not being fat anymore is great because itll save money...not the fact that theyll lead longer, healthier and more fulfilling lives..."
No need for legislation to regulate the economy? Im sure Democrats would be fine with that under a Republican president. 
LMFAO barkeep!!!!
Are you serious with the Boehner references.

Boehner looks so pleased

"Lol companies will leave China for Vietnam, India, and African states like Ethiopia before they come back to the US."
so basically Obama is going to give big companies tax breaks - what party did he run as again
Which SOTU *hasnt* mentioned tax loopholes? How many have actually been closed?
"Economic growth or 4 years of pumping $85B, per month, so the Wall Street fat cats can run the market up, on the backs of the middle class and the young. Did he say shit jobs oversees?"
[Thumbs up](http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/files/2010/11/20101104_Boehner.jpg)
Boogers on National TV. Drink! 
"Streamlining the permitting process for key projects yeah, that worked great for the Keystone Pipeline"
"Or maybe paying of trillion of dollars of debt, or we can build some roads."
Yay slash permitting process so everything is unsafe
"cut tax loop holes, rebuild infastructure. I think he has said that in every SOTU and nothings happened."
Kay Hagen has a killer necklace.
Republicans are thinking Job bills? Is that about abortion?
[Michelle Obamas hair] (http://web.mit.edu/jonb/www/animate/gossimer.jpg)
Boehner is a pleasant shade of orange tonight.
Does Obama have a small TV on the back of his head? 
"Get those bills to my desk! Do your actual job, rather than just throwing a fit!"

"So why not cut a bit of cash from the military and say...oh I dont know, fund free or cheap college education? "
If thats the Biden we know - thats not water.
Google/Apple reference. Drink.
I just want to know if he is going to legalize marijuana. seriously how else is he going to be remembered as more than the first Black president.
"The only question that I always ask, at every State of the Union: You have wonderful promises. Tell me about HOW you are going to accomplish them, not just WHAT they are. *How are these tax cuts and infrastructure investments going to be funded?*"
"All of the investments are hardly enough to pay off our debt, but they will use is in bs ways."
Patent reform? Im pleasantly surprised to hear that being brought up.
[deleted]
"FUCKING BIDEN AND HIS GRIN, LOL."
hell yeah lets reform patents
John Boenhers thoughts: I wonder how that haircut would look on me... 
I dont think Congress knows the significance of a STANDING applause. Theyre giving one every 2 min
Apparently republicans do not like research. How fucking lazy. Got to work if you want the next innovation. Stop waiting for a hand out. 
Biden just went full joker!
"If I was to request anyones birth certificate, it would be Boehner. Dude is the darkest one there."
It would be interesting if every member of congress had a helmet cam
What? You mean brave individuals didnt accomplish everything in a vacuum? Well now he has lost the libertarian vote. 
**NO TO FRACKING MR OBAMA**
Fraking is behind the gas and oil boom here in the states.
"Ginsberg, shes sleeping"
"More lies, more rhetoric, few ideas. Ho-hum. Just another SOTU from this douche. "
"Seriously, what the fuck is Biden writing back there? His next autobiography?"
BERNIE!!
Standing ovation count: we need to save more land so we can exploit it *later* and not exhaust it all right away.
"Ok, so far I got this. Lets end the loop holes in taxes so we can... SPEND MORE!!!!"
Cant wait for the GOP is pump more Remember Solyndra ads
Fossil fuel is the future
Mentioning the oil/gas subsidies in his first SOTU was big. Saying years later while theyre still around means less. 
"Seriously, stop subsidizing oil."
Gif request for Biden and his Jack Nicholson Joker smile.
"&gt;Manufacturers actively considering moving back from china to us Theyre not going to do it, but damn are they considering it."
Please fucking stop applauding every thirty seconds... Im trying to pay attention.
"Great, now he pissed on the fossil fuel companies by suggesting solar energy, and talking about cutting their subsidies. "
You can really tell whos getting paid by Big Oil by whos clapping to what. 
[deleted]
He went there. 
"Standing ovation status: suck it, global warming deniers."
More fuel efficient trucks? It would be a start. I would rather see more trains. 
The SOTU has more clap than Snookie
Wanted to hear something maybe about electric/hydrogen cars.
"Christ. He just said we should use natural gas in cars to prevent carbon pollution. But natural gas is **much** **much** worse for the climate, even before you account for the massive unmeasured methane leakage from the extraction. Were fucked."
"Thought Biden was literally going to jump, he got up so fast there"
Seriously? More about natural gas a.k.a. fracking and oil subsidies? Why arent we considering nuclear power as an option?
All the Republicans are like fuck more Mexicans...
"Man, they are consistently shooting the goofiest motherfuckers in the audience on PBS. Dont know about the other channels. "
"We think what we have recorded for 300 years can predicts hundreds of years into the future, when there where grapes on Greenland not that long ago."
Boehner looks angry.
"What is this, the third straight SOTU hes asked for immigration reform? Fourth?"
"so do we have too many jobs and need more workers, or too many workers that need more jobs? "
"HA. Yeah Detroits doing REAL well right now, Obama"
John Boehner is creeping me out...
Only 650 of thos employees get robbed daily on the way to work in Detroit
is biden texting?
How does the vice president actually perform job training? 
Chuck Schumer is the Taylor Swift of the State of the Union.
"As an unemployed college graduate (2 months unemployed (yay campaigns)), yes please."
I just cant stop looking at Bohner and Biden...
Dat Biden wink
Says the guy who cancels the keystone oil line... Hypocrite
I like Obama when he keeps calling out Congress to do shit.
Boehner- If Looks Could Kill.
People are applauding and standing more than usual..to everything Obama says and doubt he even said 1000 words... 
Hey 700 jobs in Detroit! aww yeah Detroit is comin back 
[deleted]
I think he is camera shy.
DAE think we should have the same rule that they have for the debates where nobody claps. Its like every other line gets a standing ovation. 
Misty gonna cry. 
is the stream crashing for people? its crashing every 45 seconds for me... edit: CSPAN works! better than the youtube one thank!
Standing Ovation status: democrats gotta defend the people that vote for us.
How is the seating done? Only the left side of the house is clapping. Are those the Dems?
I dont get the applause. Half the people in the room disagree with what he is saying. Seems so fake.
If congress wants to help...
Shots fired
First two rows: YEAH BEST IDEA EVER! Third row back: *crickets*

In this speech: anecdotes
"Republicans stood up for what they wanted, not what the democrats want."
Lets give people a chance by giving them money. 
"Jesus, Boehner looks like [Droopy](http://www.lesdouceursdecloclo.com/mon_univers_de_tubes/Droopy/Droopy02_dhedey1.png)."

Talk about the kids again. DRINK
Obama has been watching too much college basketball.
Access to a world-class education as long as you take on $100k in debt to go to college.
"[Ah, immigration reform.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-ill-get-immigration-reform-done-next-year/) "
Or you are unemployed? Then maybe you should have tried in collage or highschool. That is a personal problum/
Attttttta boy Estivin.
*GUARANTEE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN TO A WORLD CLASS EDUCATION* Hahahaha. Line of the night.
"Reform student loans? WTF .. Hey kids get in DEBT . and by debt I mean debt you can never shake, and money that is going to universities that are going to charge you $200+ for each book.. Not that there is anything justifying that cost.. but hey you are young and your parents are probably helping. "
Take a shot whenever the crowd claps.

Wooooo STEM. Circle jerk time!!

"Same shit, he has been saying for 5 years. Rather than get Misty more unemployment, she NEEDS A GODDAM JOB, SHE WANTS A GODDAM JOB, enough of all your Bullshit, focus on JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! That company was flooded with new workers, because there are so many people out of work. BTW - I can grow my company, add jobs (only 3) but I wont do it, since my marginal tax rate will be 50%, fuck it, not worth it for me to work harder and keep 1/2."

"As congress decides what it is going to do, we are going to move forward anyway. ABOUT TIME."
I really hope hes able to get some of the shit done. What does he really have to loose?
Capping payments on student loan debt? Good idea.
odds of things getting fixed: immigration: 5% patent law: 25% infrastructure improvents: 5% pre-k expansion: 50%
He promised relief for student loan debt when he took office. Y monthly bill says that it was a lie. 
Has anyone noticed that John Boehner is the same color as his chair? 
"Im a young man of color, my color is just white. "
[deleted]
[deleted]
"Cap student loan debt, and take a closer look at solutions. It is a start, and shows he is aware there is problem. "
You think Boehner intentionally tanned and dyed his hair to appear as opposite as possible as Biden?
"I wish he would stop with all of the anecdotes. I dont care about the CEO of some corporation or the unemployed chick...I want to hear about what the government is doing and what they WILL do in the coming year(s). I think his strongest points have been those that talk about equal rights (i.e. equal pay for women, fair access to education, etc) and those based on science and fact (i.e. global warming is real)."
"Standing Ovation status: were all sexist, that gonna change?"
Yeah if you can go ahead a get me a gif of that slow zoom into Michelle from across the room... That would be great
He referenced Mad Men! #hipPOTUS
Bidens tie is giving me flashbacks. edit: I am watching on c-spans minimized screen.
So should people with kids be allowed to miss more work than those without? 
HAHAHHA MAD MEN EPISODE!!
"They make 77% of every dollar really thats the huge lie that gets a such an explosive applause, gotta pander to that demographic of course. "
"Barely mentioned but pretty important: one of Obamas foreign policy priorities is to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will increase trade with Asia but also export US IP law and increase American influence in the region: http://curiousmatic.com/secretive-pacific-trade-deal-will-bring-together-40-worlds-economy/"

"So lets start pandering to women now for the their vote in November. Edit: I know hes not running, but other democratic senators and reps are in November. What he says here will be defended or attacked upon on many campaign trails."
Equal pay for women....why has this not happened yet?
I know Obama is a FAR better speaker than Bush but the anticipation of wondering what would come out of G.W.s mouth was MUCH more fun than this...
"Whoa, you cant wear plugs in the legislative chambers! Old people might have heart attacks from not understanding what those are. "
Democrat here. Obama has said hes going to give everyone jobs and give everyone a college education. He hasnt said the word budget once. My question of the day is where the money at?
"Ah, if only all the countrys problems could be solved by completely fabricated anecdotes. "
"The kids like, uhhh, clap now, right?"
TEN WHOLE DOLLARS AN HOUR
"As a Latino getting into debt as I continue my law school career, the debt really does kill me moving forward."

Random awkward pizza workers seem a little out of place at the State of the Union...
Pizza guys. Dont be so awkward. You are the real heros of America!
Biden is getting a hummer under that bench. 
That kid looks terrified.
"Can anybody tell me why the people sitting down in the front rows never appear to stand? Even when the rest of the chamber is giving a full standing ovation. Are they Supreme Court judges? My boyfriend says they are military officials who hate Obama. But I say, then why dont they stand when Obama says how great MURICA is?"
"Do what you can to raise your employees wages. Its good for the economy, its good for America. But what if workers must be laid off for a business to be able to afford higher wages? That doesnt sound helpful to me."
"See my plan is to just continue straight up ignoring my student loans and let my credit go to shit until Im able to actually pay them without sacrificing food in my belly. Im very aware that Ill never be able to purchase a house with my choice of profession and I live in a city so I have no need to ever finance a car, so fuck credit and fuck the student loan racket."
"If you cook our troops meals, you should not have to live in poverty"

Just tuned in. Has it been this bad the whole time?
"I like pretending that everyone in the chamber is really, really high."
10-10 - Are we passing laws based on how easy they are to remember and catchy they are to say now?
GIVE AMERICA A RAISE
"10.10...I could dig it....Buttttt, wont people just lose jobs?"
It saddens me that we think ten dollars an hour is a living wage
Is Boehner about to cry? He seems very sad.
So do I get a raise now? 
"Love it, republicans against a raise to the minimum wage during the Reagan era. "
"Im really enjoying the halfhearted applauses. Yeah...yeah (clap, clap) ye..."
Every republican asshole just tightened up so hard they could become a diamond factory.
"10 10, its easy to remember.. Is he laughing at the 9-9-9 plan still? ehehehe"
Tell me more about this MyRA please Obama.
Give America a raise!* * And fewer hours and even fewer job openings for first time job seekers
MyRA?
Is he trying to say My IRA?
He just asked that unemployment should be extended because of a lack of jobs... But companies should pay *more* for employees DAE understand basic economics?
Give america a raise I hope the guy flipping my burgers and taking my order stops fucking up my order at 10 dollars an hour. Of course you could always just get a machine to take my order that doesnt require 90 dollars a day.... hmmmm. 
MyRA!
"There we go, discovered how the President intends to pay for all education hes promised. "
MARCO RUBIO! Take a shot of bottled water!
MYRA? No risk? Bonds?
Lets give America a raise Boehner looked like he tasted shit when he said that.
Uh oh. Teleprompter got mixed up. 
"i usually dont care what they say in these things bc its just a PR show for americans to think these things will happen.. but good god, this is pathetic.. womens rights? what about all the illegal shit you are doing bro!? lol talk about AMERICAN RIGHTS! "
Is he saying ira it my r a?
"That MyRA shit caught my attention, good job Obamas SOTUA team. "
"why isnt the guy on the right behind Obama standing up, is he glued to his chair?"
"Everyone should be standing the fuck up for that one, everybody"

"Question, because I honestly dont know.. Lets say the federal minimum wage is raised to $10.10. I have a job that averages out to $19 an hour. If my wages didnt go up while everyone elses did, would my wage have less purchasing power(or whatever the correct term is) than it previously did?"
Why is it impossible for him to mention the working class or poor?
Obama about to stick the ACA right up the Republicans ass. 
"She got covered and 1,000 other peoples coverage was cancelled."
"$10 isnt nearly enough. It needs to be about $12 adjusted to inflation, and it should increase accordingly. As always, US politicians never do enough to support American workers. Unions are dead, collective bargaining is dead. How do you expect to keep money flowing into our consumer-based economy if you dont force businesses to pay their workers a wage that one can live on?"
Lol I like how Obama knows all about here people.
I like boehiners spray tan
"Oooohhhhhh, way to compliment Rubio, his career with the GOP is now over."

That whole section of people not clapping
Bohner is at a solid [8]
This is like a political GDT I love it. 
I have never ever ever seen somebody so obviously bored and displeased than Boehner is right now.
He is making the point that the Republican plan (AKA: THey can reject you for pre-existing conditions if you switch jobs and therefore coverage) is extremely problematic.
I love these real people they keep showing its great I feel like the President and government as a whole really cares about me.

"Boehner didnt applaud the notion of women getting equal pay. Despite how everyone is refuting that this is an actual issue... that seems ridiculously sexist. Edit: Actually, he seems to applaud nothing at all. Its as if he insists on finding a flaw in every interest Obama has. LOL at his applauding of everyone having the right to vote!!!"

"A few points of contention I have with Mr. Obama: a) The solution to joblessness is not to increase unemployment funding, its to open up funding for the many projects you promised instead of funneling it into a broken and corrupt health care reform system. b) You are the executive branch, not a dictator. You still have to work with the other branches as part of your job; if I refused to do a massive part of my job, Id be fired on the spot. c) Equal pay for equal work already exists. This tired wage-gap myth has already been thoroughly debunked. d) Good to see you invest in alternative energy. Good on you. Now lets see how much of it is given to your political donors or lost to companies like Solyndra. If you keep your word, as I hope you do, good on you. e) Mr. Obama, hearing you talk about how partisan politics is hurting America is sorta like hearing Stalin talk about how central government is inefficient. When you are the worst offender of your party, its very hard to take you serious. f) Bragging about Detroit. Really bro? g) It doesnt matter how much job training and job protection programs you create if there are no goddamn jobs. Stop spending money on stupid shit, fix our immigration system, deport illegal immigrants who commit crimes, and make an efficient legal system for immigration, and you will have a relatively healthy job system. h) $9/hr is still poverty, sir. i) At what point are we going to stop pitching manufacturing jobs, and start making jobs that are actually worth a damn and necessary? Who gives a fuck what youre manufacturing if you have no money to buy it with. j) Universal Kindergarten is a good idea. Its not yours, and you need to stop acting like it was your idea, but it still is a good idea. If you pull it off, good on you. k) Its not that people on the opposite party arent willing to compromise, its that your version of compromise is do everything your way or do nothing. Compromise entails actually offering solutions on both sides and coming to an agreement; have you ever considered the Republicans are pushing really hard against you because youre an ideologue who refuses to compromise? Theyre assholes too, but come on Barry, youre not dumb. l) Please, more substance, less sob stories. m) Also, please, stop trying to spend money we dont have. My childrens future is looking worse with every word you say. n) I almost voted for you the first time. Youre making me very glad I didnt. Please actually create solutions instead of spouting out ideas with no way to fund them or long-term plans. o) If your policies fail, can we spend the next eight years talking about how they inherited your mess and the President isnt responsible at all? p) Can you, the rest of the Democrats, and the Republicans please screw off? The Republicans are bad, but at least they understand math. EDIT :: people seem to be bitching about section p. The Republican plans are too drastic in terms of cuts, and they cut to the bone, but at least they are TRYING to balance the budget instead of spending us blind. Its telling that one party is speaking about cuts to everything across the board until we level our deficit and debt, while the other is talking about how they can possibly spend more. The Republicans are shitlords, dont get me wrong, but again, at least they get math. They understand if you have zero of something, you probably shouldnt promise people more of that zero something. EDIT Part 2 - The Edit Strikes Back :: It also is making me very sad that you guys dont understand reddiquette. You disagree with me, ok, but that doesnt mean you downvote, that means you comment and have a discussion. If this is how you Obama fans treat people you disagree with, that might be the reason nobody is willing to compromise with you or have a conversation with you."
Joe Bidens little heart is smiling :) 
"This pre-k nonsense... the only thing kids do in pre-k is play with coloring books, eat boogers, take naps, and eat a cookie. Call it what it is - taxpayer funded daycare."

Thats one LARGE sailor... Hes definitely a top...
"Cntr-F SNOWDEN, NSA. [My thoughts as expected](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O1hM-k3aUY&amp;t=0m9s)."
Standing Ovation status: SUPPORT OUR TROOPS
Not going to say anything about the NSA or Marijuana 
Boehner just threw up in his mouth a little.
Obama has the Not Bad face is full force!
Anyone know who the guy sitting net to Michelle is?
Can we get a gif of Bidens approving look?
"Good that he is talking about lessening times to vote, when others are trying to increase times. Hopefully this publicity slows down their efforts."
"Wait, are ALL our troops really out of Iraq? Not being sarcastic here, I legit didnt know that if its true"
"This guy sounds like a radical fascist. How is he a liberal democrat again? Any republican spewing this pro oil, pro natural gas, pro patriot act, pro student loan debt babble would be dragged to the street and shot."
I went to take a piss what did the president say to get boehner to stand up?
Its not over until the last american is out - notice the military guys not clapping at his nonsense 
[deleted]
"None of the military officers clapped at all with mention of the end of the Afghan War. Edit: never mind, just read about how theyre obliged to remain neutral."
"Damnit Joe, its not over yet, sit down..."

Why does womens equality in the workplace keep coming up in his speeches? What is this 1850?
Apparently Boehner can applaud.. 
By cutting their retirement pay.
Theyre standing after every sentence. Not every statement made deserves a standing ovation!
Did he just promise to nation build in Syria and Mali?
What office is he running for?
Most of the broadcast http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/slow_clap_citizen_kane.gif
We need to decrease our defense spending and international military presence. Lets return to our pre-WWII isolationist policies.
DAE remember Libya?
Is Ruth Bader Ginsburg asleep??
Dont drones strikes feed extremism?

I limited drone use YEAH OKAY BUDDY
Is there a rule that to be a woman in congress you have to have fallen out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down?

NSA allusion...drink

"Ill reform our surveillance programs = Full speed ahead, just dont get caught next time."
OK so no more NSA watching us via Angry birds. oh yeah thats liberty!
WHY IS OBAMA NOT WEARING A DOUBLE WINDSOR? DOUBLE WINDSOR IS SUPREME.
WOW that was short about spying on american citizens. Aaaaand everyone claps for Guantanamo.. 
[deleted]
Damn these guys stand up and sit down more then a Catholic at mass...
Oh we are going to close Guantanamo Bay? Where have I heard that before?
annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd thats it. One sentence on a years worth of crazy news of privacy invasion.
who is the guy that the camera went to when he talked about confidence of public for intelligence
Close guantanamo bay?! OBAMA 2012~! Change we can believe in!
Jesus. I forgot John McCain was still alive. 
closing guantanamo anyone who still believes this at this point is pretty much hopeless. 
Hes been saying close Guantanamo for a long time now. 
That was for reddit 
Holy fuck these comments are ignorant.
the last sixty years called - it wants israel and palestine back 
Very tepid applause for a half hearted vow to mildly reduce spying on the American people.
"Standing Ovation status: Israel got this, we can step down now."
Republicans love them some Israel 
"Oh please Obama, there isnt ever going to be a state of Palestine and you know it."
Aaaand theres the Israel mandatory mention.
Fox News is going to be so much fun after this. 
John Kerry looks like a muppet.
Does anyone here believe this about Iran?
Does this guy ever tell the truth? 
"Wait, I thought the usual line was that Israel was a secular state. "
Ohh dear god....can we just clap at the end of it please!
That guy looking around to see if anyone else was standing up...
Ignore Israel having nukes it stole from America...
"Cmon, he didnt just talk about spying, drones and gitmo? Is he really this delusional? He has been the POTUS for 5 years, ALL of these, could have been stopped under HIS watch..who wants to bet gitmo will be open next year? "
"Drone strike reference in 1, 2, 3, "

BUT LET ME BE CLEAR
I will do _________(whatever I want) with or without Congress.
Wonder if he will mention Ukraine? 
First time in a political game thread. This is hilarious. Its impossible to make well-thought-out comments on a live event like this so everyone just goes bat shit crazy.
John Boehner looking like Americas first black speaker of the house behind Obama right now ... homie looks like he went to the tanning salon and ordered the extra crispy. 
You can hate or love Obama. The man is a damn good public speaker. 
Boehner is about to get up and punch Obama if we look at his face very closely. I called it.
"Could somebody please explain to me what the major topic being discussed is? I just recently got to see part of it and it was something about minimum wage? Is it being raised or something? Im sorry, I dont follow politics and I dont really have a side. I would just like to know what the important topic is if anyone is nice enough to give me a nice, laymen-termed summary."
That woman looked like she was in pain. Edit: That woman = Samantha Power (ambassador to the UN)
[deleted]
"What topics did Boehner applaud, standing applaud, or notably NOT applaud? Seems like hes following harsh party lines even during a speech. "
Can Iran build a potato gun? 
OK so .. lets get to it. What about fucking DRONES and the NSA on US soil. Why is the US govt a threat against US citizens? 
Samantha Power just farted.
Hurry up and legalize weed already - 
Is Boehner getting paid based on how snarky he looks?
"Whos more a person of color, Obama or Boehner?"
They could spend 20 bucks and buy a new coat of varnish for that woodwork.
"Cameo to Samantha Powers--poor thing, she looks so miserable. Bless her heart."

"Thats great, keep focusing on other countries and do nothing to help people here. Awesome, A+ Obama. /s"

"For a roomful of U.S. Congressmembers, that was a pretty weakass U-S-A! chant"
That lady had a fine fur coat. Very fancy.
*by cutting their retirement pay
Fur coat? WTF
Why does Chuck Hagel always look so sad..?
I just want to hear what Boehner wants to say.
Im picking up a strange new emphasis on the Asian Pacific. Warming us up to the TPP? I dont recall hearing any politician talking about that region very much at all.
War drawing to a close? Yeah right! Always be someone to fight. (Damn why am I so cynical?)
"&gt;Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day. I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say ?we are not afraid,? and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook Oh look, more gun control that only affects law abiding citizens. What part of shall not be infringed does he not understand? Time to support your local NRA, 2nd Amendment foundation, and write to your representatives to stop these infringements to your 2nd amendment rights."

CORY CORY CORY!!!
"I mean, Ill give it to Obama: Hes great at telling stories, at anecdotal pieces that tug the heartstrings. Unfortunately stories are just words and dont do a goddamn thing to change anything. Also, I seriously doubt Corey here is waiting for the day he can serve again. He should know the Rangers would never let him go active."
Somebody is clapping like an asshole.

Bravo fine sir! USA USA USA! 
"Shout out to the Olympics. Both sides stand up with an aura of excitement and applause, shouting U-S-A. Lets bring home the gold. Today, this is what brings us together as a nation. Why was this even in the SOTUS speech?"
I knew that Biden smirk looked familiar. http://picchore.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ATT00002.jpg 
"Ok, I feel violated when Obama claps into the mic."
/salute 
That black lady in the gray suit to his right was nearly clapping in his face at the start of that. 
FEELS
"...the point being what, exactly? VA reform? "
Dat metronome clap.
you cant be commander in chief of the largest military in the world and not mention them at least once
Thumbs up count for the night: 3 
"i have to say that our military has done a pretty good job of staying out of politics this decade -- despite the amazing sacrifices they make day in and day out. the seal team 6 writer/leaker &amp; general petraeus aside, im impressed."
Wait so were proud we sent this guy to war 10 times? 
"Wow, this clap has been going on for way too long...."
Tear from Michele?
Neither side wants to be the first to stop clapping!
&gt; Sometimes we...make mistakes Well thats the truest shit Ive heard in a long time. 
Awkwardly long applause.
And then kids I showed em all my bitchin scar. Got a 5 minute standing ovation. They are never going to believe him.
That was a long applause.
"Ok, you can stop clapping now."
Murican as fuck.
"Politics reminds me of professional wrestling. They act like they dont like each other but I picture them getting together after this tonight for some drinks. Mitch McConnell whips out a big bag of cocaine, Boehner snorts up a big fatty off Bidens man gash. "
To free other nations from tyranny and fear. 
"America doesnt come easy. It comes hard, and fast, wherever it wants to."
"John Boehner is just sitting in the back blankly because he is a stupid fucking republican who doesnt know shit about anything. There should be no republicans in that room, as well as America. If you are republican, just leave this country. We can replace you with hard-working and unselfish immigrants anyways. "
We have placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress. Good line. 
MURICA!
BELIEVE IT. Obama = Litereally Naruto. 
"The fact that I see our soldiers fucked up from war makes me sick that we are sending these guys over and over overseas. These guys have seen over 8 tours of duty and ..not one .. not one deserve the damage that they have sustained. Fuck this shit, I was all for it post 9/11 but not now.. lets get the fuck out. No more. These guys are going over for tours over and over again, its horrible"
"Standing Ovation status: jingoism, ho!"
"Placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress.. to promote equality under the law -Until now, somehow."
"So no NSA, bleh."
Thats all folks. 
Time for a nice cup of Tea.
Not a word about the NSA 
Wait. Its over already?
"Four minute standing ovation for a troop that got blown up on his tenth fucking goddamn deployment. You all put him there, you murdering fucking bastards, you all belong at the end of a rope and youre cheering over your crimes you lousy goddamn fucks"
Why did I watch this?
"Wow, 1 hour 20 min."
"Well shit, that NSA bit really hit the nail on the head....."
Who was the designated survivor?
"I feel like this was a microcosm of Obamas tenure, in a less strenuous time hed have dome quite well, but he was clearly not up to the task of tackling the problems of a do-nothing congress and an ailing economy. "
Thats all folks. Once sentence on the NSA.
Im glad to see that Obama threw a few punches at the Republicans for their obstruction this year. I want to see some progress and it was nice to hear that he is more than willing to take action on his own if he has to. 
"Standing ovation count: maybe 36 or so? Didnt see cameras focus on crowd for some of them, hard to tell."
"Damn, Obama just snubbed Corey Booker."
SCANDAL OF 2014: OBAMA LOOKED AWAY AND STOPPED CLAPPING FOR THAT VET FIRST - PROOF HE IS THE EVIL MUSLIM KENYAN USURPER 
God bless America? What God? Fucking fundie Hitler.
The rich hope we are all so poor one day we have no choice but to join the brave military ventures that fund their coffers and seal our fates as a bastard empire state that is destined to burn not only ourselves but most of the world with us.
[deleted]
Any stream for the response?
That security guards face in the camera...
Now comes the fun part. Listening to the GOP complain. 
I had the thought in my head that at some points Boehner looks like Jafar from Aladdin....
Solid Bush bashing when talking about not getting into open military conflicts. I can dig
"So, now where can I watch the official responses from the GOP? I want to see Cruz accidentally spill a candle or something equally retarded to Bachmann looking at the wrong camera last year. "
Is this the same thread for the response?
Whats up with they two bald* guys that are really close to the camera when the POTUS is entering and leaving.
"Same old song and dance: the terrorists are gonna get cha, patriots. You sign up to rob and kill people overseas? Dont come crying to me when you get a boo boo, hero."
oh man...like...jeeeez glad I waited for that bullshit.
Launch Operation Cheddar
I like how he actually proposed ideas that are concrete and could feasibly be implemented. 
"When Obama said that ordinary citizens were not being spied on, the exact first thing on my mind was Aw, shit; Obama just ruined this for Reddit."
Anyone just hear Alex Castellanos comment on the speech?
Alex Castellanos evaluation on CNN was priceless just now: It was like sex. Even the worst is still great. Newt Gingrich literally just gave him a stare like Da fuck?!
"Two sentences about the NSA, no comment on benghazi, no comment about Marijuana legalization, didnt mention snowden. But its ok 4 year olds are getting Grade A nap time. "
"Ugh so sick of hearing the Republicans bitching about Obamacare and how it takes away peoples insurance. Its fucking bullshit - the reason your insurance is being changed is because it does NOT meet the minimum federal standards, aka your plan is shit. You should be happy that you arent paying for something that is substandard and that you are going to be receiving a better plan."
"Oh god, off to a bad start on the response. What am I, 7 years old?"
Whos this lady on the sofa?
Anyone else find it awkward that she is sitting down? Though.....it is better than the one year when whatshisface took a drink of water mid speech.
Working at McDonalds can help pay for college!
The Republican sounds like she is on an infomercial. 
Is it only me or does this seem very very forced? 
"Aaaaaand Cathy Rodgers is looking into the wrong camera. Wow, go Republicans. Blinking red light not quite obvious enough, huh?"
[My commentary on the Presidents SOTU address is now available.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4bftQ4xxFc&amp;sns=e)
trusts people to make the right decision thats part of the problem
How is there an official GOP response (or any official response) so soon after the speech? 
Pacific Northwest Republican women represent! [Oh... wait...](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.186326!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/alg-resize-sarah-palin-jpg.jpg)
"President Obama really is the best republican president we have had in literally decades. The right has gone so very far to the right that he might appear liberal, but in reality he is just a moderate republican. If the republicans in the house were not crazy, and the democrats were not so spineless we would have fixed many of the common sense things he talked about tonight. Now I am watching some apple pie spewing AMERICAN FUCK YEAH lady talk about in platitudes. All I can say is that you all had better vote next election."
Seriously Republcians how do you fall for this shit? is the thought of being considered equal to the 1% because of your race and religion more important than what actually is? 
If the GOP hates government so much then why dont they stop running for office?
"The new republican platform is: Legalize weed! Im stoned right now, just look at my eyes!"
She is all over the place with her soft-sell.
LMAO who gave this lady acting lessons? Reminds me of Winona Ryder in Mr.Deeds talking about Dr. Pepper.
"How much do you think that glassware over the presidents left shoulder, in front of Boehner cost?"
Her voice and delivery is reminding me of Mugatu from Zoolander.
Jesus Christ this is awful 
This chick needs a sip of water. 
Somewhere off camera a Repub is holding a gun to Coles head.
Response? More like an autobiography
[deleted]
Not much dignity is bought by 7.25 an hour.
Shes like...chirpy. Why is she talking about her kids and husband instead of politics she disagrees with and her proposed improvements/replacements?
A job is so much more than a paycheck. But your party wont raise the minimum wage. Ok...
Why is this lady on every channel? 
Whats with Republican Women with down syndrome children being made the face of the party?
Do they not understand they already have the religious vote tied up ? 
Extra 21st chromosome? Seriously? GoP talking about people with down syndrome now?
Shes still talking about herself..... Someone needs to tell her that this is meant to be a response to Obamas speech and not a speech about her life. 
"lol @ a kid with Down Syndrome loving Bruce Springsteen. Also I GUARANTEE he doesnt actually do that shit. He might dance to some music, but the most American of musicians as a name drop was DEFINITELY a plant."
This Cathy girl is sounding really pathetic. 
Is she talking about her own family?
"The rebuttal, from i went to college because I had 4H animals to jobs to 21 chromosomes? WTF?"
"For those who are interested, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh7LBtrBq1g) is the response of socialist councilmember for Seattle, Kshama Sawant, to President Obamas State of the Union address. It seems they are running a bit late though, so be patient."
[deleted]
This womans voice is more boring than Romneys. Sounds about as unbelievable too.
"Focus on jobs first, without more spending So, nothing then? Nice. Oh! And a shout out to spending government money on Christian schools under the guise of choice. Great."
Is John Boehner wearing blackface to make a racist statement about Obama or is he unaware of how bad fake tan looks on him?
I think she needs a sip of water. 
"Hey, I missed the State of the Union. Where can I watch it now? "
immigration reform...by securing our borders? wut
Is this the same GOP case of increased fees that has already been disproven?
Betty does not exist.
"Washington, you have some explaining to do. "
WTF is going on here. 
[deleted]
Heres the video of the SOTUS http://youtu.be/5b9_H03gsiM
"I guess, A year of real action means another year of just filibustering and shitting all over Obama."
"If any of the political commentators call this a strong speech, then they are high. "
Not a word of the failed drug war or the fact that two states have laws that are illegal federally.
This is like a speech in Idiocracy. 
This lady is a train wreck!
Brookland. I think she meant Brooklyn?
Brookland 
"Is it just me, or are her eyes very red, teary, and glazed over?"
*Boy from Brookland*
Lol she messed up.
Did she really say the republicans represent a union where they dont care where you came from? Really???? Edit: typos
[deleted]
Yeah theyre pretty good in taking the average worker.
"This woman represents all of why the Republican party is viewed the way they are. What a truly cheesy, awful response."
Sooo.... is anyone actually buying this? 
"Pregnant three times? Awesome healthcare, bro"
The president said a lot of things but I dare him to try to get any of them through the House.
"Turn down the gain on the microphone, I just want to hear her not whats happening inside of her."
"One hell of a speech, as they said on NBC: very center left agenda phrased in a center right friendly fashion. Funny enough to keep everyone engaged, and serious enough to instill confidence. Quite an amazing standing ovation for the injured veteran. Like the increase in federal wages, and the way Barry wants to handle the nuclear situation in Iran. U.S.A.!! "
A prayer? WTF is this? 
Her eyes are too far apart. 
Everyone pray.
"Put your hands together everyone, time for a prayer"
I think the 4 republicans are having a contest seeing who can say more BS in 10mins. This lady is winning atm.
At least shes talking about opportunity instead of entitlement.
Brookland stand up!
"I understand a token God Bless is expected, but why is she praying to god every five minutes?"
*Brookland* Pre K? Why would we ever want to fund that?!
She doesnt even go here!!!
HALLELUYUH!
That was a lot of Gody McGoderson at the end there.
What is with her opening her eyes real big?
Well that was a bit tame. Looking forward to the crazy versions though.
"You ever notice that wherever you go, Brookland is always in the house?"
"Much more moderate response than usual for the GOP. Now comes three more...the Espanol one, the Tea Party one and the Rand Paul Party one."
Meant to soften the Republican image Oh brother.
"Wait, that was the response? Aside from Tax Breaks, School Choice and nebulous health care reform I dont remember anything specific? Isnt this the party that has congress and could actually put forward specific proposals, or am I miss-understanding the American process?"
The first thing Fox News is stating after the GOP response is that its hard to follow the act of presidents SOTU speech.
"cbs literally said next to nothing about the republican response because there was almost no coherent agenda, just talk about downs syndrome and appeals to god"
Al Sharpton compared the response to a Hallmark card.
How are these people on NBC supporting the republican response? Theyre talking about how great her response was...
Paul Krugman: Where was the content? There was nothing there!
A hallmark card. Thats exactly what it was
Krugmans a sad little man. 
I liked the amusingly-timed dolly out while she concluded her speech with prayer stuff haha oops
Rep Rodgers: were going to one up the President by bringing up our own tragic warrior story. Only ours is dead. Because thats better.
"not a single NSA mention! we did it guys, the NSA is gone forever!"
Anyone else catch how loud her blinking was? Right at the end of her response... *BLINK* *BLINK* 
I hope the Republicans can offer something more substantial in the upcoming Presidential election then just a nice narrative. There was absolutely nothing in that speech that told me the Republican vision for our future.
Cathy McMorris Rodgers GOP 2014 State of the Union response http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUup59f8iI
Is this Tea Party guy telling people to march on Washington?
"I like the guys on CNN just throwing commentary as theyre watching the GOP responses. Pizza on the table, no ties..I could watch these guys. Theyre visibly rolling their eyes whenever Cruz speaks. "
"Big government keeps poor people poor, Mike Lee? Maybe we should raise the minimum wage. Nah, that would make people poorer. #TeaPartyLogic"
"I missed it, anybody know where I can watch the whole SOTU?"
"I tuned in over halfway through in the live-stream, had to double check to make sure I wasnt watching the 2013 SOTU because he was talking about raising the minimum wage again like last years speech never happened."
INEQUALITY GODZILLA! 
INEQUALITY GODZILLA
I thought Lady Grantham gave a great Republican response.
"Will CSPAN play the tea party response, or should I be tuning in elsewhere?"
The CNN reporter clearly disagrees with Ted Cruz right now. I think he is sitting there in disbelief at all the bullshit coming out of Cruzs mouth right now.
"Obamas speech was fact based with anecdotes to back it up, while the Republicans response speech (apparently one of four) was anecdotal with facts of that specific anecdote. The fact that Republicans decided that an appropriate response to the State of the Union was what might as well have been the book summary for that womans future autobiography amazes me."
" In the Republicans response......Republicans believe health care choices should be yours, not the government?s. And that whether you?re a boy with Down syndrome or a woman with breast cancer, you can find coverage and a doctor who will treat you. But if you want to control your reproductive system, we Republicans have a way of shutting that whole thing down. "
"I fucking despise Ted Cruz, thats right, grandma said it."
Why do republicans think that they get to have a rebuttal after every SOTU?
"Still waiting on the paul embarrassment, where can I catch it?"
"The Republican response was so vapid. Does anyone else ever get the feeling that the Democrats and Republicans dont *really* disagree on anything anymore, and just say they do to keep up appearances to the public? If this is the case, it makes sense that the Republicans have little to nothing substantial to say in opposition."
Thank you Senator Ted Cruz for going full retard on live tv. 
Go to black while I eat a congealed wing. CNN confirmed for having played the SOTU drinking game
"What was in the two envelopes obama gave the speaker and vp , and why?"

I am personally interested in the green party response. 
Oh Rand Paul.....dis gonna be good.
"In the interview on Fox News, rand paul just came out against ending extra subsidies for big oil, and accused Obama of not wanting to work with congress. *facepalm*"
During the speech what were President Obama?s main economic proposals. main 4 or 5?
Rand pauls claim that every study shows raising minimum wage results in higher unemployment sounds like bs.
"Gabby Giffords ad on MSNBC right now for Americans for Responsible Solutions. Followed by an ad tying Keystone XL to Chinese investment. Happy campaign season, everyone."
"First time Ive followed Twitter while trying to watch. Its very distracting, but Im curious how senators and representatives tweet during the speech. Do they just give a list to an aide and tell them when x is mentioned post y?"
Phew. Thank god I dont have cable! 
I thought the speech was very nationalistic and positive.
"More Lies, Lies, Lies. Impeach Obama http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/28/president-obama-uses-rosy-math-his-state-union-mat/"

The lady on CNN in the focus group started talking about teen pregnancy...where did that come from?
Tea Party response is saying pro-choice is inequality... I dont even know what to say to that. 
Lets bomb Iran1!!1! Cause theyre SOOO evil! U.S.A! U.S.A!
"Finally, he legalized it. "
How long are these scores hidden for?
"I disagreed with the tea party response, however it was more put together and actually much more professional relative to the actual republican response. Interesting. "
"Can I just ask, in reply to the rebuttal, whos fucking American dream is it to be a fucking congresswoman? I want to be filthy rich and own a Caribbean island."
Cathy Mcmorris Rodgers cant stop gulping during GOP Response http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOBJi2Uzer0
"CNN poll question: Will Obamas economic policies move the country in the right direction? Tricky question, since Congress will refuse to do it. So even if they were the best ideas in the universe, the right answer to that question is No."
"And to give you an idea of how shallow and vapid SE Cupp is, she is now praising the message of the rebuttals lol."
"House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement afterward. ?The president must understand his power is limited by our constitution, and the authority he does have doesn?t add up to much for those without opportunity in this economy.? (Says the man who siezed the opportunity to preside over last months budget fiasco which drained $42 billion from this economy)."
"Chocolate Jesus comes out and feeds you idiots more lies, upon lies, upon even more lies - and you leftist cowards slurp it up like the little cockroach mother fuckers that you are. Hope and change, mother fuckers. Hope and change. "
Alright lets start with America will always be at war and have war debt because the federal gov cant legally collect federal income tax with out it( this is a fact) but doesnt mean that our president wont change this because hey there in debt! Now I believe a lot of people deserve more money but if you believe that raising minimum is going to change anything then you should have failed history and economics because there is not one time that minimum wage went up and cost of living and everything else didnt. Then cost of milk goes up with cost of gas for crying out loud...wake up people!!! Uh he just lied again to everyone about health care and unemployment.

Blah blah blah clap blah blah blah clap.... total bullshit Democrat or Republican. Total joke. Dont tell us what your plans are but what you did. You been in office long enough..
"Im at 38 minutes out of 89, and God DAMN, Obama isnt pulling any strings. I think the GOP should be more afraid of a lame-duck president than a fully complaint DFL (democrat) congress. Edit: I mean, hes getting a huge standing ovation that looks like well over 55%... Damn......"
Anyone else notice the twiddling of the thumbs right above the Presidents shoulder? 
Stand up clap stand up clap
"Obama didnt say much about cultural issues such as gay rights, marijuana legalization and reproductive rights. Probably he wanted to stick to talking about the improving economy and to mocking the Republicans, which he did really well. Cultural topics tend to be more divisive. Still, this is a historically important period for these issues. The culture is steadily becoming more liberal in its attitudes and, with the right push, could reach a breakthrough."
I have to give Obama credit. To spew that much bullshit for over an hour straight. Whew. 
I made this a while back. The quote at the top is from the tard the image was made to shame. http://www.liquidmathematics.com/phonestuff/taxrates.png
I compare the speech to watching a cornered dog.
"As usual, lots of beautiful, inspiring rhetoric but painfully short on action and more beating of the dead horse of pleading for bi-partisanship. "
Obama I think did a great job with his speech. It highlighted just how antiquated most Republican views are . How can Boehner not applaud giving women equal pay and not punishing them on healthcare just off being a woman? I get that in modern politics he has to disagree with anything Obama says but how as voters do we allow that kind of stupid philosophy in office? I just picture all the old white guys that run the Republican Party sitting around after the speech grousing about having to give the walking dick holsters equal treatment 
"Not a single policy idea in the rebuttal, but rather an amalgamation of syrupy platitudes about American greatness, perseverance and of course, the obligatory religious pandering - none of which had anything to do with what the President said. "
Is minimum wage officially going to get raised or what?
can someone link me the video of SOTUS? late to the party and have no idea where to watch it. please!
*citation please* I hear this conspiracy on every board talking about this issue but not one fact to back it up. 
"[Nope.](http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/nevada.asp) [Nope.](http://www.thewildlifenews.com/2014/04/13/right-wing-disinformation-bundys-land-is-not-solar-farm-for-harry-reid/) [Nope.](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/04/13/is-harry-reid-involved-seven-answers-to-seven-questions-youre-probably-asking-right-now-about-the-nevada-rancher-situation/) Even Breitbart isnt making this claim any more: &gt;Despite the obvious partisan gain to be had if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reids son Rory (a failed 2010 Nevada gubernatorial candidate) had somehow been involved in a land grab affecting the Bundy family ranch operation ? the facts just do not pan out as such. Indeed, Rory Reid did in fact have a hand in plans to reclassify federal lands for renewable energy developments. Just northeast of Las Vegas and Nellis Air Force Base, plans were drawn by Reid allies to potentially develop 5,717 acres of land for such use. While it would be fair to claim that such activity was in Bundys relative neighborhood, the federal lands once leased by the family were more than 20 miles away, east of Overton, Nevada. "
The whole thing is to facilitate a dirty solar deal for Harry Reids son. Not sure why the entrenched left is so adamant about lining the pockets of a corrupt senators family.

"I agree. I just wish either he left it as it was, or just went the whole hog and had legit socialized healthcare, none of this in between crap."
"What promise has this motherfucker kept outright? ...And I dont mean shit like socialized medicine, because I feel like Obamacare?which forces you to pay privatized healthcare/insurance companies to cover you?is the exact opposite of socialized medicine."
"My apologies for taking so long to reply. I appreciate your well thought out response. I. While I dont agree with it, this was determined to be legal under the last administration. I think the enemy combatant program clearly is illegal, but until a court stands up and says so, its legal. II. Obama put an end to using black sites on his second day of office. He also refused to challenge the previous administration on the legality of this practice. Congress would also have a hard time pressing charges against Obama about this because they knew about it and approved the practice. III. President Bush was quite open about bypassing the FISA courts when spying on Americans. The practice has gone unchallenged legally, and so it continues. IV. This is a power that presidents have exercised for more than 50 years. Signing statements are subject to judicial review, but a signing statement would have to be a pretty serious violation of existing law for it to justify impeachment. V. I Googled this. Interesting. There have been a few Congressional Subpoenas issued that the Obama administration has not complied with (The Fort Hood Shootings, HHS regarding Health Care implementation, Fast &amp; Furious and other smaller items). I didnt know enough about this. I dont want to disagree on this one. I would say, however, that Congress has a lot of power that they are not exercising. [This article was helpful](http://www.talkleft.com/story/2007/7/8/1731/15806/lawrelated/The-Congressional-Subpoena-Power-How-It-Is-Enforced) (but long. And technical) VI. Thats a stretch. From where I sit this ACA is a *gift* to private insurers. As far as misleading Congress, its Congress who created the bill, not Obama. If there is an attempt to destroy the private insurance market, creating a mandate that every American has to buy private insurance seems like a strange way to do it. VII. [Obama has increased border security](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jul/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/more-border-security-and-patrols-under-obama-previ/). [He dramatically increased the number of deportations](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/10/american-principles-action/has-barack-obama-deported-more-people-any-other-pr/). VIII. The claim that there were intelligence warnings of terrorist attacks in Benghazi is unsubstantiated. There is nothing there. IX. The claim that the IRS unfairly investigated conservative Tea Party groups has also been debunked. Liberal political groups were equally targeted. I dont mean to be an Obama apologist. I genuinely believe that the power exercised by every President since Nixon is an overreach of the position and would very much like to see that power restrained. It could be that impeachment of a President is what needs to happen, but really Congress just needs to get its shit together and reclaim some of those powers. Impeachment was an arguable reality with Bush. Fabricating facts in order to lead the nation to attack a foreign country is a giant accusation. Outing a CIA agent is a smaller crime than leading a nation to war on fix facts, but still certainly a high crime. "
"Edit: I try not to be hyper partisan, as a socially liberal, former Republican. Perhaps its my previous experiences here in the echo chamber of r/politics. &gt;Dennis Kucinich wrote up articles of impeachment for George Bush Using these as a staring point. I feel a case could be made on the following articles: Article I Illegal Detention: Detaining Indefinitely And Without Charge Persons Both U.S. Citizens and Foreign Captives Article II Rendition: Kidnapping People and Taking Them Against Their Will to Black Sites Located in Other Nations Article III Spying on American Citizens, Without a Court-Ordered Warrant, in Violation of the Law and the Fourth Amendment Article IV Announcing the Intent to Violate Laws with Signing Statements Article V Failing to Comply with Congressional Subpoenas and Instructing Former Employees Not to Comply Article VI Misleading Congress and the American People in an Attempt to Destroy the private insurance market. Article VII Misleading Congress and the American People, Systematically Undermining Efforts to Address Boarder Security / INS / Illegal Aliens Article VIII Repeatedly Ignored and Failed to Respond to High Level Intelligence Warnings of Planned Terrorist Attacks in Benghazi. Article IX Obstruction of the Investigation into IRS targeting during the 2012 Election, Fast &amp;amp;amp; Furious "
"Bullshit. ER visits are a red herring and contribute between 2-10% of the cost of healthcare. A bigger driver is the fact that Medicare and Medicaid patients only provide the providers with 60 cents on the dollar that private insurance provides. The providers (hospitals and doctors) overcharge the insurance company to make up for the shortfall that government care causes, and then and only then does the insurance company pass that cost onto you. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/28/nick-gillespie/does-emergency-care-account-just-2-percent-all-hea/"
"There are two hidden taxes, higher medical bills from unreimbursed expenses, and thus higher insurance premiums are one, estimated at $700 to over $2,000 a year for everyone who has insurance. The other, that overlaps, is the more than 60% of bankruptcies caused be medical bills. "
You have always been paying for the sick and the old. In the most inefficient way possible. Emergency room visits. Insurance companies dont just write that off. They pass the costs onto YOU! 
"Insurance companies dont pay for uninsured ER visits. And frankly, most hospitals overcharge an obscene amount for ER visits (I know as my mother has worked in one for years). Private insurance is a scam. When Americans are paying twice as much for healthcare than any other countries, with outcomes that are declining (as in life expectancy is dropping, infant mortality is up, etc.) then obviously private insurance is failing, because insurance companies care about profits (excuse me Wall St.) to the exclusivity of all else. The profit motive in healthcare is essentially psychopathic."
Exactly. Republicans want their cake and eat it too... 
"Something seemed fishy about this article. http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/15/ron-johnson/obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-havent-gone-do/ Though premiums have risen in a few states, the ACA does not raise rates directly. Premium reductions arent really happening in red states that fought the rollout. While they were campaigning against ACA, other states were creating exchanges that have yielded some of the biggest reductions in health insurance premiums. Instead of asking the public to pay more to keep their doctors, the states need to explore their options in beefing up these networks, IMO. Edit: Formatting"

Even in studies where people were flat out told something was a lie when they were initially exposed to it, they eventually started to believe it was true with enough repetition. Its terrifying, if you ask me."
"44% believe in ACA death panels, according to the latest Kaiser poll, up from 41% when that was first put out by the Republican party in 2009. Yet Kaiser keeps these idiots in the general poll of approval /disaproval of Obamacare. Asking someone who believes there are death panels if they approve of Obamacare is hardly going to yield an accurate poll."

"This is only half of the impact. The other half is the direct effect of this sort of rhetorical tactic, called the Gish Gallop. (Pretty sure there Used to be a. Wikipedia article on it, but I can only find one on [RationalWiki](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop).) Its a technique developed by creationist debater Duane Gish in which you overwhelm your opponent with mountains of misleading and false statements. It always takes the opponent more time to address the lie than it does to state it, so the opponent cannot address anywhere near all of your points in their allowed time. This leaves the opponent with three poor choices: 1) address as many points as possible, 2) make no rebuttals and focus on other issues within the scope of the debate, or 3) call you a liar and then do 1 or 2. If the opponent chooses option one, you simply say that they failed to address all of your points and therefore they must be wrong because they cannot explain things. If the opponent chooses option two, say that they didnt address any of your statements because they must not have an answer. If they choose option three, accuse them of making baseless accusations (because they dont have enough time to prove all of your lies, see option one rebuttal), then rinse and repeat. This leaves your opponent in a perpetual state of damage control, scrambling to keep up with the mountain of complete garbage you throw into the debate. If they address your statements, they lose. If they dont address your statements, they lose. If they call you out on it, they lose. And if you do it enough the audience will start to believe what youre saying. Thats where the Illusion of Truth effect comes in."

"Well, Bush blew a huge federal surplus and got us involved in an unnecessary war while Obama had created more jobs as of April than Bush did in 8 years. Federal spending has slowed under Obama and health care costs are already decreasing thanks to ACA and were not at war with Iran or Syria. But hey, keep voting to hurt yourself just cause the old white guys yell freedom! and Murica!! louder. [source](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/04/obamas-numbers-quarterly-update/)"
"I agree with you. There are large groups of people in this country blindly back either party. If Romney had wasted hundreds of millions on a non functioning website, democrats would be all over him, while republicans would claim that the democrats were to blame. If McCain still had detainees at Guantanamo Bay and was killing civilian foreigners with drones, democrats would be losing their mind. They both get financial backing from major corporations in order to hold their positions which obviously gains influence. Neither party went after the bankers that ruined our nations economy. Our defense budget it still through the roof. We still are in Afghanistan and have postured against several other nations. If this were the case with a republican in office, democrats would be up in arms. "
"What exactly do you want from prove it? A link to a democrat being bad? A link to every single bad thing a democrat has done? A comparison in link counts? Googlefight? Do you consider that to be worth anything at all? What exactly are you looking for? Conversely, what would you post if I was asking you to prove it? If Im going to spend my time having this debate, lets at least establish the ground rules. Yelling prove it and insults at me like a retarded child deserves nothing more than nuh uh, you prove it, but Ill humour you. Also, a question for you. What has Obama done that makes him better than Bush, and what has Bush done that makes him worse than Obama?"
"Youre already spending your time having this debate, youre just not adding anything if value."
"Im trying to establish what you would consider to be of value. I really dont know. Why dont you answer my question? Thatd be a good start. What has Obama done that makes him better than Bush, and what has Bush done that makes him worse than Obama? Until I get a response, I consider the absence of one to be proof enough."
Were still waiting on your proof how theyre all the same. 
"One thing you could do is find an example of the Republicans wanting to do something good, that they passed in their Republican controlled house, but the Democrat senate didnt pass. There are times when both Republicans and Democrats agree on something thats terrible, and maybe Democrats dont fight hard enough on certain issues, but every time there is a difference, Democrats are always on the right side of the issue. Food stamps is one of those issues. The democratic senate already passed it and obama already said hed sign it, the only thing keeping it back are the republicans."
"&gt; GOP was supposed to support a piece of legislation that was crafted behind closed Dem party doors (...) Yea, lets forget about the [Heritage Foundations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_mandate#History) idea of a individual mandate in 1989, and [RomneyCare](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/mar/20/romneycare-and-obamacare-can-you-tell-difference/) which ObamaCare was based off of. &gt; (...) where the public couldnt find out what was in it until after it was passed, (...) I love this talking point, because its so [damn stupid](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/pelosi-defends-her-infamous-health-care-remark/2012/06/20/gJQAqch6qV_blog.html). &gt;Those ten seconds, immortalized by Fox News leave out what Pelosi said in the lead-up to those infamous words: &gt; You?ve heard about the controversies within the bill, the process about the bill, one or the other. But I don?t know if you have heard that it is legislation for the future, not just about health care for America, but about a healthier America, where preventive care is not something that you have to pay a deductible for or out of pocket. Prevention, prevention, prevention?it?s about diet, not diabetes. It?s going to be very, very exciting. (...) &gt; ?In the fall of the year,? Pelosi said today, ?the outside groups...were saying ?it?s about abortion,? which it never was. ?It?s about ?death panels,?? which it never was. ?It?s about a job-killer,? which it creates four million. ?It?s about increasing the deficit?; well, the main reason to pass it was to decrease the deficit.? Her contention was that the Senate ?didn?t have a bill.? And until the Senate produced an actual piece of legislation that could be matched up and debated against what was passed by the House, no one truly knew what would be voted on. ?They were still trying to woo the Republicans,? Pelosi said of the Senate leadership and the White House, trying to ?get that 60th vote that never was coming. That?s why [there was a] reconciliation [vote]? that required only a simple majority. &gt; ?So, that?s why I was saying we have to pass a bill so we can see so that we can show you what it is and what it isn?t,? Pelosi continued. ?It is none of these things. It?s not going to be any of these things.? She recognized that her comment was ?a good statement to take out of context.? But the minority leader added, ?But the fact is, until you have a bill, you can?t really, we can?t really debunk what they?re saying....? So, you were wrong, she did say that, but it [was taken out of context](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWEeP7bY9Lw&amp;list=PLC138775743C3B8B1#t=415) &gt; (...) where you cant keep your insurance or your doctor (...) The people that couldnt keep their insurance couldnt because the insurance they had didnt cover anything at all. "
"So let me get this right -- GOP was supposed to support a piece of legislation that was crafted behind closed Dem party doors (without the promised C-Span coverage) with crafty presidential deals and letters not worth the paper written on, where long and deeply held moral and religious beliefs are trampled, where waivers are passed out like Stalinist favors to big corporate buddies and cronies, where the public couldnt find out what was in it until after it was passed, where you cant keep your insurance or your doctor, and where the Hill leaders pushing the bill have a childish habit of being nasty to the GOP. In other words, the GOP is just supposed to shut up and support the worst legislation to come down the pike since Rostenkowskis catastrophic healthcare plan. Right. "
"&gt;where long and deeply held moral and religious beliefs are trampled, Which ones are those? To save you some time: you dont have an answer because youre spouting bullshit."
I cant tell if you really believe what you just wrote or if you are being sarcastic.

"Technically, thats still inequality, even if its only five cents. Tryhard? http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-women-make-77-cents-/"
"It kind of makes sense that part of the gap is because the jobs women usually take are lower paying jobs that the jobs men usually take. But then you have to consider if a job like school teacher is only low paying because its dominated by women, whereas a job like computer programmer is higher paying because its dominated by men. From one of the comments: &gt; Ive studied salaries over time for clergy. Salaries went down as women entered the market. I often heard church boards argue that they could call a woman for less money. I think this has driven down wages in that field. For some of your low paying jobs it may be that the salaries are lower because women are in them, not because they paid less before women entered them. It would be informative to look at the salaries of secretaries and school teachers over time, to see if the transition from male domination to female domination correlates with a decrease in salaries, simply because employers feel they can pay women less, and therefore they will also pay men less."
"&gt; What is wrong and embarrassing is the President of the United States reciting a massively discredited factoid. The 23-cent gender pay gap is simply the difference between the average earnings of all men and women working full-time. It does not account for differences in occupations, positions, education, job tenure, or hours worked per week. **When all these relevant factors are taken into consideration, the wage gap narrows to about five cents.** And no one knows if the five cents is a result of discrimination or some other subtle, hard-to-measure difference between male and female workers. I know why the President lies about this, but whats your excuse for not calling out the 23 cent gender gap as a lie?"
Mostly that fact that it isnt. 
This post hits the nail right on the head.

"Quite a bit separates the two parties. You might not consider abortion or gun ownership to be important, but that doesnt mean they arent valid reasons for supporting one platform over another. --- &gt; Both support big business and bailouts. Both receive financing from big business. This one is correct and unfortunate. &gt; Both support interventionist foreign policy Thats a very vague phrasing. Democrats are more opposed to military action than republicans as a general rule. The push to bomb Iran is largely Republican. &gt; Both have made war in countries we didnt need to be in. This statement doesnt really mean anything. Its just a personal opinion about where we didnt need to be. Its overly simplistic to suggest that the US didnt need to be involved in the World Wars. The US participation in the WWI and WWII are arguably what pushed our economy to dominate the world stage for 50 years. &gt; Both continue to support a federal reserve system that loans the government currency that carries interest, which makes it impossible to ever get out of debt. The US government has been in debt *since in was founded*. There were a few years around 1835 were the US had almost no debt, [^(1)](http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/debt-and-gdp-main6.png?w=1024&amp;h=603) but the US being in debt is not a new phenomena. &gt; It was a democrat that stole all privately held gold. I assume that youre referring to [Executive Order 6102](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) or 1933? Where the government ordered all private gold owners to *sell* their gold to the government at a price of $20.67 per ounce? &gt; Democrats got us involved in WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. The most recent war in that list started 57 years ago... Also its *HIGHLY* disingenuous to say that the democrats got us involved in WWII. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was was drew the US into WWII. &gt; The democrats started the welfare state that has failed to lift people out of poverty. Actually, many Americans (38.9%) will find themselves in poverty at some point in their life[^(2)](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/PageError.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/Default.aspx), but programs like welfare and food stamps help lift these people out of poverty so that only 11.6% will have experienced more than 5 years of poverty. There are also thousands of other factors that contribute to American poverty. &gt; Obama assassinated US citizens. Thats a very grey area. The only American who was intentionally targeted was Anwar Al-Awlaki, who was a self-proclaimed Jihadist working for Al Qaeda in Pakistan who claimed to have trained the underwear bomber.[^(3)](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57585798/who-were-the-4-u.s-citizens-killed-in-drone-strikes/) &gt; Obama expanded the drone strikes in the middle east. Correct, but drone strikes have lower civilian casualty rates than traditional warfare. You can argue against being in Afghanistan at all (and I would agree with you), but increasing drone use might be preferable to other forms of combat. &gt; The Obama administration has ruled that drone strikes against US citizens on our soil is within the executive powers. Again... thats a very grey area. The white house made it clear that they were only referring to someone who posed an immediate threat to the lives of others. Much in the same way a police officer is authorized to use deadly force without going through a trial. Personally I dont see the need for drone strikes inside the country, but the justification is not entirely without merit. &gt; Obama refuses to close Gitmo. Actually Obama has repeatedly tried to close Guantanamo, but has been blocked by Congressional Republicans, notably Ted Cruz.[^(4)](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/177/close-the-guantanamo-bay-detention-center/)"
"On a phone so I cant format like your post, but will follow its outline the best I can. Guns and abortion - both are ways to get their people elected to maintain the status quo. Interventionist foreign policy - the Republicans want to attack Iran, Democrats want to attack Syria and did get involved in Libya. Wars we didnt need to be in - I can almost grant WWII a pass because the Japs attacked us. But they attacked us because of our economic sanctions. Again due to interventionist foreign policy. But all the other wars we were not in immediate danger of being invaded. The closest would have been WWI, the Zimmerman note that promised Mexico all the lands lost in 1848 if they sided with the Central powers and invaded te US. Our solution, war with Germany. The Federal Reserve - They print the only legal tender. We have to buy their tender with treasury bonds that are worth more down the road than is paid for them up front. They return the bonds for more than they paid, meaning we have to issue more bonds than before to cover the interest on the previous bonds to buy more FR notes to begin the process over again. We can neer even begin to pay our debt in this system. Stolen gold - yup, FDR ordered all privately held gold turned over to the government for $20/oz, then revalued it at $35/oz to sell to other governments. They stole value if nothing else. Welfare state and poverty - those of us at the threshold have been taxed into poverty in a failed attempt to end poverty. We are not living in LBJs utopian great society. Assassination of US citizens - is this Anwar al-alwaki the father that was assassinated or his son that was also assassinated. And being US citizens they are guaranteed a trial. Even when a cop kills someone that poses an immediate threat is not justified. We are guaranteed a trial. Remember Dorner?

"Bush wasnt going to lose no matter how you look at it. Americans were pretty stupid around the 2004 election and people didnt start to realize how badly the Bush administration fucked this country until after 2006. Remember Bush had the big scandal in which Dick Cheney ordered one of his staff to leak the name of a CIA operative in order to retaliate against her husband. They held the investigation so that it wouldnt conclude until after the campaign. You also had the Alberto Gonzalez attorney scandals in which the Bush administration went after Federal Prosecutors who werent toeing the Republican party line. Obama has had plenty of scandals in his presidency but none of them are anything like Bushs. He was still elected in 2004 with all of that hanging over his head, I dont think putting Clark on the ticket would have made much of a difference. "
"I agree it wouldnt have mattered.

Certainly sites like factcheck.org that called out all the little lies didnt exist and bloggers that currently do thier digging into the rights scandals that are ignored by the corporate owed media were still in thier infancy. The left wouldnt even harass the power of the internet and social media to get voters out until Howard Dean and the 2006 election. "

"The thing that both parties are going to lentghs to pretend doesnt exist is the mandates of the free trade agreements like GATS which basically preordained only one outcome to the whole healthcare debate for the US years ago, a situation which results in a lot of people dying unnecessarily every year as the US gets more and more behind the developed countries on healthcare quality. Just so the corprations can use the investor-state provisions to coercively gain access to markets in other countries. So, I cant see any explanation other than that the two parties wanted the US to get a privatization of the system because anything else JUST WOULD NOT DO, given our stance - a stance which almost no Americans would understand - because it seems very immoral to view things like public healthcare and efficient, low cost provision of services as a theft of a market from its corporate owners, which is how the free trade agreements frame things. So, so the means by which big US corporations shoehorn open foreign markets would not hav eto be changed, each American is going to have to spend a half million dollars they otherwise would not have to spend, over their lifetimes... This was too important to leave up to democracy, so the corporations have been working on making it something that nations could not change through democracy and thats what the politicians are trying to do, lock in privatized healthcare irreversibly. So, they both decided to play good cop bad cop and pretend to disagree. They are posturing a fair amount but in fact they agree a lot more than disagree. They agreed to put corporate interests ahead of Americans interests, even though thats something which represents a very real betrayal of the best interests of the people of America, all of us. Something they know we can no longer afford.. They did this to block single payer, paid for by taxes, everybody in, nobody out, all doctors in network, no more gag clauses, no more tiers, no more bankruptcies. Single payer which we can afford, and which would save a huge amount of money. **Instead we got something much like what they have in Massachusetts which has resulted in NO shrinkage of medical debt and no improvement in affordability.** The result is that weve been shoehorned into a healthcare model we havent been able to afford since the 90s, and nothing else got discussed. This is in a context of healthacre financing experts already knowing before the 2008 election that none of the things purported by Obama would save money. All in all its been a really disgraceful acting performance for all of them. They have let the American public down miserably. "
"I wouldnt say Obama lied, but there really wasnt a central debate about the nuanced aspects of the legislation. Instead we got screaming about Death Panels. So the press, opposition (conservatives), and ignorant fellow countrymen all failed us in this respect. Incidentally, this very much reminds me of how people talk about Obamas campaign promises. As though those promises were the central discussion in the 2008 election. There was no in depth discussion about whether closing Gitmo COULD be implemented because everything was being drowned out by a shouting match about whether Obama was a communist or whatever. "
"Personally, I think people are just dumb when it comes to Obamas misinterpretation of You can keep your plan if you want to. If the person has read anything about the ACA, they know that it establishes plan minimums, and obviously if the plan you have doesnt meet those minimums then its against the law. Will it be more expensive? Sure, if it covers more then it will probably cost a little more. At no point do I honestly think Obama meant to lie to people. He assumed if they followed the ACA they knew about plan minimums, and he meant that they wouldnt cancel plans for no reason and force people to buy on the new state/federal exchanges."
"Wow, a politician omitted the nuances of an unbelievably complex piece of public policy, that only a handful of people are really qualified to make any kind of intelligent commentary on, in order to garner public support for said policy? Stop the fucking presses."

"After seeing people lose insurance, and then be told their new insurance is 175% their previous rates, after having a military commander address his troops that after he had done the math we may as well take the fine for not having insurance because our family plans are about to become far too expensive to afford on our paychecks I would say Obama was a little more than somewhat dishonest and flat out fucking lied. Now, I understand he didnt MAKE the affordable healthcare himself, so it is possible he was lied to, in a bad way, but he sold it."

They are taking a risk that they dont get run over by a bus and they are pricing that risk too low, so when they do get run over and their crappy insurance doesnt cover things, I pay for that. No you cannot keep your plan because their plan costs me money."

"No, he completely lied, but Republicans arent feeling the whole story when they are covering the issue. Both parties are liars and that will never change. "
Jon stewart is a Butbush
"It looks like someone in the administration finally told Stewart to stop criticizing ObamaCare so much and go back to playing out-of-context clips of Republicans and making goofy faces. Keep up the good work, Jon. "
"Here come the wingnuts -- oh, right, they are. Top comment I wouldnt say Obama lied... Get your heads out of your asses."
Its outrageous how liberals just eat up the words of Stewart. Democrats play the politics game much better than Republicans. Not sure if they are better liers or their voters are more gullible. Either way the hypocrisy in Stewart making that statement is pure comedy. 
Dis some classic whitewashing/deflection.
Jon Stewart is an entertainer with no political acumen but he can turn a phrase and make a seemingly witty remark. Whats amusing to me is that you far left liberals think that there is real merit in what he says. 
Somewhat dishonest. How polite. Lying like Motherfuckers. How predictable. This is why I stopped watching The Daily Show. 
"I use to respect Stewart when Bush was in office and he would point out the administrations bullshit, I assumed Stewart was playing the non partisan role of speaking truth to power, who ever that power lied with. Then Obama got in office and I realized that Stewart was just a partisan hack. Such a waste of what his show could have been."
Seems about right.
"Look. Obama lied because even his most fawning followers would have baulked at the truth the majority would lose their health care for the few. The former Marxist professor undoubtedly knows whats best for his cringing, crouching dirt eating, dirt preferring, dirt loving subjects. Although he has his IRS and NSA enforcers, Obama as yet lacks the secret police necessary for him to unfold his vision of socialist paradise on the disregarded masses. Clinton proved lying is very popular among Democrats, now Jon Stewart crows Obama has just taken this to a new level and made him moist. Clearly, the unabashed love Obama bin Biden will have rained down upon them by their low information voters will make the next Pol Pot pie easier to bake."
Im surprised Jon Stewart was even able to admit that Obama is dishonest. I cant imagine how hard that was for him.
It would be more accurate to say that Obama Somewhat Dishonest About Healthcare ~~But~~ **AND** Republicans Are Lying Like Motherf*ckers This headline is what bias looks like. Using but instead of and implies that one politicians lies are justified by another politicians dishonesty.
"People seem to think that bending the truth (what many people would consider to a point of a lie) is the same as bold face lying. When you say if you want to keep your plan, you can it hinges on the *if you want to* part. The assumption in the statement is that with a high deductible plan, that you can get thrown off of retroactively for failure to disclose something that you didnt know about, that has a lifetime limit and covers only a fraction of your actual costs (meaning if you get sick youre screwed, insurance or not) you would *want* to change it. So, while bending the truth and living in his own little fantasy world, he was not bold faced lying. He was just, living in a reality that may not entirely coincide with ours. Politicians do this all the time. Sometimes theyre more pronounced, sometimes they are outright lies, but not often are they so visible and so definitive that you can truly nail them down over it. Hell claim that youre better off not having those plans, and that you shouldnt have wanted those plans. Sure thats your choice, but thats what hell say. Personally we should have just gone to a universal paid-by-taxes system that did away with all this crap and been done with it. But whatever."
"That guy from The Five needs his teeth smashed in with a sledgehammer. If he were to die, so be it. "
"oh, jon stewart making goofy faces at out of context news clips, thank goodness"
So this has gone from being good thing for our country and the millions of people without healthcare to still a good thing for our country and the millions of people without healthcare and a minor inconvenience for handful of people? This is what the Republicans were so concerned about that they have to lie about its effects on a near daily basis?
I cant be the only one who doesnt give a shit that these people cant keep their joke of a plan.
"Jon Stewart is a Zionist shill, and so is Obama for that matter. And so are the Republicans. The Daily Show (more like the Daily Zionist Show) needs to be closed down, but since we know who owns Viacom that isnt going to happen."
I think people mis-understood the spirit of what Obama was saying. His point was that this new plan wouldnt eradicate older plans. 
"Its not complicated. Obama either lied or hes an idiot. You lefties want to defend Obama by trying to refocus the attention on lying republicans but no matter how much you try to refocus it, the fact remains that this whole healthcare act is all Obama and the liberals doing. You can say republicans are lying and fear mongering but it can also be said that some of them are self diluted idiots who are exaggerating too. The failures of Obamas healthcare act and how the republicans are capitalizing on his failure are separate issues. So when I hear John Stewart finding a way to somehow turn this back on republicans, it only shows how biased he really is. He appears to be objective but hes not, its all part of his cute Im witty and smart brand. His priority is the marketability of his show. Cmon reddit, youre his target market. You should know better. Bottom line, these politicians and the majority of Americans, especially redditors, dont understand economics. If you did understand how a functional economy works, youd know both the old and news systems are flawed down to the core and nothing will change because everyone is somehow benefited by it, in one way or another. Oh yeah Im an Independent, in case any of you busybodies where wondering."
"More or less sums it up: Obama is a liar, Republicans are despicable. Get over it."

"the POTUS lied, no biggie. Look at those nobodies. They are lying like motherfuckers!"
"I feel like the only people who are shocked are the same kinds of people that are shocked things like the Patriot Act led to domestic surveillance. Anyone who paid attention to the policy debate around ACA knew this was coming to plans that didnt meet the required minimums. Everyone knew the prices of those plans were going to go up. Thats why they added in the Government subsidies to help people pay for them, in many cases while the plan will be more expensive the costs will be picked up by the Government and many people will personally pay less. I have very little sympathy for people who dont pay attention to things their Government is doing. None of this was hidden from you except by your own ignorance. "
"I think the point to his comment was if the healthcare bill was or is as bad as the opponents of said bill claim it to be they wouldnt have the need to invent stories and sling constant lies about it. Getting bit by a poisonous spider would be a pretty bad idea but would I really need to say something like Dont get bit by that poisonous spider it might make you more likely to get struck by lightning! OR IT MIGHT CAUSE SPONTANEOUS MALE PREGNANCY. No, it being poisonous is bad enough you dont have to give me a little song and dance number unless you think it really isnt bad at all and just need to tilt the balance between me being bit and not being bit. And in relation to Obama being dishonest Jon Stewart also gave plenty of jabs and punch lines involving Obama and Obamacare but his political satire makes a good point. Healthcare was even worse prior to Obamacare or did everyone forget that part already? Obviously its far from perfect and the bar just happens to be very very low. "
"Those fucking teahadi terrorist arsonists, theyve got some balls. Ban these RethuKKKlicans from politics."
"I dont CARE if Obama lied about keeping your shitty scam policy. He talks about having faith in God, too, but I think hes probably an Atheist - and Im good with that lie, as well. Presidents LIE, kids. The trick is figuring out if the lie was for the greater good or not."
"Good thing Jon Stewarts just a comedian, and youre stupid if you listen to him. At least, thats what he says when it gets way too serious for him."
"This all boils down to the fact that the right has far more notable crazies than the left. There are plenty of Republicans who are just somewhat dishonest about Obamacare, but they dont matter because the only part of the party that anyone hears is the Ted Cruz wing. And yes, that wing straight up lies about Obamacare. Of course, any time you start rating lies about on how bad they are you know youre dealing with a bad situation. "
"I [linked](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/citizen.asp) to the Snopes article in another comment since they explain it pretty clearly. Basically, while a Kenyan born Obama would have been eligible for citizenship due to his mothers heritage, he would not be born with it due to residency requirements of what was then the law. The law required a US residency of one of the parents for so many years after a certain age, which his mother was too young to have. This would bring into question whether or not natural-born means literally born with citizenship or just born with the possibility of citizenship. For instance if I married a woman in France and had children, they would have citizenship from both. If their children also become citizens automatically, then eventually all of France and most of Europe would be American citizens."
"&gt; the argument can be made that a Kenyan born Obama would not be a natural born citizen but a Canadian born Cruz would be. I asked you to explain this. I read the rest of your post. I want you to explain how, even if he was born in the middle of Mecca and his father was the Ayatollah, Obama wouldnt be a natural born citizen when his mother was a US citizen. Yes, Taitz is a kook and the argument is purely rhetorical, but you brought it up. "

Of course not. &gt;its done by people looking to jump on Obama for any little thing This story was broke by NBC news. Not really your bastion of right leaning journalism. It has since been covered by every major news station including CBS, ABC, NPR, etc. Major fact checkers say that it is a lie. No matter how you spin it, the President said something that wasnt factual, and he may or may not have known that what he was saying was a lie. Either way, it boils down to either he lied, or he doesnt know what is going on with his signature health care bill, which would mean that he is incompetent. Is it as big of a deal as Iraq? Fuck no.

If Obama had said for the majority of people, you can keep your health insurance policy if you like it that would be true. If Obama had said if you like your health insurance policy, and it complies with the minimums of the ACA, you can keep it that would be true. What he said was a lie, pure and simple. 3. The whole other people lied, therefore this lie is okay is bullshit. Im a Democrat, and I cringe every time someone defends Obama by saying but Bush did X. 4. Both are straight up bullshit.

It?s part of a House Republican campaign, led by Boehner, that contends the GOP-controlled House has done its job in trying to strengthen the economy. &gt;Westmoreland mailer: ? House Republicans have introduced more than 30 bills to help create jobs, grow our economy, and get our country back on the path of success. These bills have all passed the House with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, 27 of these bipartisan bills have hit a brick wall in the Senate, where leadership in the Senate has refused to bring these bills to the floor for an up or down vote. &gt; Inflated claims of bipartisanship are not uncommon in Washington. In September, President Barack Obama overstated past bipartisan support for each proposal in his jobs stimulus bill. But ? just as with the claims we examine here ? parts of the president?s plan received only token Republican support while being opposed by an overwhelming majority of Republicans. &gt; Westmoreland?s mailer provides a link to the ?complete list of bipartisan legislation blocked by the Senate.? We used the Library of Congress website to track the votes for each bill. The first bill the GOP lists has been passed by the Senate and signed into law ? contradicting Westmoreland?s ?brick wall? claim. The bill was the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act (known as the payroll tax cut extension), which Obama signed Feb. 22. The GOP?s website still lists the bill as ?awaiting Senate action? and provides an outdated outline of the original bill, which had hardly any bipartisan support and barely resembled the final version. Ten Democrats voted for the version touted by the GOP. But the final version passed with true bipartisan support, as 146 Republicans joined 147 Democrats to approve it. &gt; That bill was an exception, not the rule. We also found: &gt; A majority of House Democrats supported only five of the 27 bills. &gt; Less than 30 percent of the House Democrats supported the rest of the bills. For example, only 57 of 192 Democrats ? about 30 percent ? voted for the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, a bill that loosened regulations over pesticide use. &gt; Less than 10 percent of House Democrats voted for 10 of the bills. Only four Democrats, for example, voted for the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, which would require congressional approval of federal agency regulations. source: http://www.factcheck.org/2012/03/bogus-bipartisan-claims/ "
"Obama was a senator. Senators can filibuster bills in the senate, cant they? If Obama tried to stop Bush from raising the debt ceiling, why didnt he filibuster the bill? Could it be he he knew the debt limit would be increased even if he voted no?"
"You are a fool. Enjoy losing the next round of elections. EDIT: for those downvoting let me fucking clarify - this is false equivalency BULLSHIT. There are more than a few differences between an attempt at a shutdown during a period of economic well being that serves a goddam purpose, and a actual shutdown soley for the sake of it while the globe teeters on the edge of economic collapse. The wealthy made out like bandits for the last 10 years, during the previous collapse and recession, and they will continue to be just fine. The rest of us are clambering to get back to a state of stability and these fucking retards go and do the fucking dumbest thing ever. Not just for their party of idiots, but for the whole planet. This was engineered by the billioniare Koch brothers, theres evidence all over the net they arent hiding it. They have pre-scripted social media responses and you have fuck faces coming to reddit to defend their actions. GET FUCKED. "
On the democratic speaker of the house shutting down the government 12 times. Politifact rates it as half true. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/04/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-late-speaker-tip-oneill-served-/ Also concludes that its not how government is supposed to work.
Why yes I quite enjoy living in this country. This is nothing new. Both Obama and Reid tried to stop Bush from raising the debt limit. They just didnt have the power to do it. Tip ONeil shut down the government 12 times when he was Democratic Speaker of the House. Whats happening right now is exactly how the system was designed to work. Both sides take an equal yet oppositely aggressive stance and then must compromise. Neither party is going to get everything they want and thats the way it should be. Thats the definition of compromise. Everyone needs to take a deep breath and stop being so emotional. Were being played like fools by these politicians.
Its also very similar to the 30+ jobs bills the House passed but Harry Reid tabled each and every one of them. He wouldnt even let the Senate vote.
"&gt; actually Obamas senate record was never incredibly progressive **Fact Check: Mostly False.** Obama regularly ranked in the top 10-12 as far as liberal voting went while he was a Senator, by almost every available measure. He wasnt the most liberal Senator, but he was definitely in the top ten. As Politifact [explains](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/several-ratings-rank-obama-lower/), he wasnt the most liberal, but he was up there. "
she probably had the most well received speech at the DMC barring the president himself
"Finally, an intelligent comment amidst a bunch of politcal hackery"
"actually Obamas senate record was never incredibly progressive, he only campaigned like one so no one bothered to check. warren on the other played a defining role in creating the Consumer Protection Bureau. She introduced legislation that would make student loans have the same rates as bankers which both pointed out a huge hypocrisy in our system and also allowed us to see who was actually looking out for students in congress. She has an incredibly consistent (if short) political history, unlike Obama who, as we have discovered, is all bark and no bite. You also make it seem like shes doing these things to set herself up for a run, yet she is very much avoiding the press, gaining notoriety through her actions rather than through any promises she has made. by all appearances she has no interest in a run, though if there was enough popular support Id hope she would anyway. Overall shes a significantly better candidate than Obama ever was."
Yeah Im on her email Listserv and there are constant events in Massachusetts that make me think that she is an insanely busy senator. So glad I voted for her.
"&gt; Overall shes a significantly better candidate than Obama ever was. She lacks presence, charisma, and the ability (at least to my knowledge) to captivate and move an audience. These shallow measures mean a great deal in American politics. "
"Which is why Obamas birth certificate - from Hawaii, which was a state already - should never have been an issue. His mother was American. End of story. But since it wasnt, the Republicans have some crisp coming to them. "
"&gt; Natural-born citizen does not necessarily mean born in the United States. Wow, TIL. I actually did not think of the parents being citizens part. At first I was kind of glad he would be ineligible to run...but...I guess he can."
"It doesnt matter that he was born in Canada: His mother was a U.S. citizen. Through her, he gained US citizenship at birth. Barry Goldwater ran for president in 1964, despite being born in Arizona before it was a state. His father and mother were born in California and Missouri. George Romney was born in Mexico, but was still able to run for president in 1968, because his parents were American citizens. Natural-born citizen does not necessarily mean born in the United States."
"And John McCain was born in the Panama Canal zone. Which makes the birther controversy during the election even funnier because we actually did have a candidate not born in the states, just not the one people suspected. "
"That was exactly the point. Affordable health insurance, not exactly affordable health care. 5k is nothing if you could have a 100k+ medical bill. The insurance could save you from a lifetime of debt. "
&gt; not necessarily to make it cheap for the rest of us. Nope. Our politicians lied to us: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/06/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-everybody-will-get-more-and-pay-/
In the long run I certainly think that could be the case but we have to have more people in the pool to drop costs while the other parts of the law lessen the gouging by the insurance companies. 
well having affordable healthcare for everyone wouldve been nice.
"&gt; But the point of the AFFORDABLE care act is to make care affordable. I thought the point was to make it affordable for people that otherwise couldnt get insurance because of pre-existing conditions or other reasons, not necessarily to make it cheap for the rest of us."
"So hes right in the general sense that the map is misleading. [More food stamp recipients are Democrats than Republicans](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/12/the-politics-and-demographics-of-food-stamp-recipients/ ). &gt;Of these [households where at least one person receives food stamps], about one-in-five (22%) of Democrats say they had received food stamps compared with 10% of Republicans. [...] &gt;According to the survey, about three in ten Democrats (31%) and about half as many Republicans (17%) say they or someone in their household has [ever] benefitted from the food stamp program. But, that doesnt account for conservative Democrats. When phrased ideologically rather than by party, the difference disappears: &gt;Self-described political conservatives were no more likely than liberals or moderates to have received food stamps (17% for each group), according to the survey. His statements about race are flat-out wrong. &gt;Blacks are about twice as likely as whites to have used this benefit during their lives (31% vs. 15%). So blacks are disproportionately represented vs whites, they are no where near approaching equal numbers. We could do the math using the percentages and proportions of total population, but [these nice folks](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/01/newts-faulty-food-stamp-claim/) have done it for us already: &gt;For 2010, Census data show the following for households that reported getting food stamp assistance during the year: 49 percent were white (non-Hispanic); 26 percent were black or African American; and 20 percent were Hispanic (of any race). So non-Hispanic whites account for about twice the number of food stamp recipients as blacks, not nearly equal numbers as he stated."
Cite your stats or its bullshit. 
THIS is the kind of discussion that is awesome - actual numbers and data. Deep bow of thanks (and an up-vote).
"o_O No. [Just, no.](http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/penalty.asp)"
"Just wait until they start locking people up for not paying the Obamacare fines. You didnt help this insurance company meet its bottom line, we fined you, you didnt pay. Have fun rotting in prison. At least in prison they will get the same kind of healthcare most liberals have been preaching for, free healthcare!"
"Using your own source (verb) 1. To observe secretly with hostile intent. 2. To discover by close observation. 3. To catch sight of: spied the ship on the horizon. 4. To investigate intensively. I just dont see collection of metadata or accidentall collection of substantive data as meeting these definitions with regard to Americans. To claim that Im or youre being spied on just isnt supported by fact. [Politifact couldnt even make a conclusion on the way less dramatic question of whether Americans are being targeted for surveillance.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/jul/02/are-americans-being-targeted-surveillance/) &gt; The legal experts we reached all agreed that FISA does not specifically define the word target. They all said its meaning is implied in the law?s language. Nathan Sales, law professor at George Mason University School of Law, told us the government?s intent is key. &gt; The law defines ?electronic surveillance? to mean ?intentionally targeting? a person, Sales said. Overall, the law implies that if the acquisition is inadvertent, it doesn?t count as targeting. [edit: to clarify, these are clearly spying programs, but theyre not spying on Americans] "
"I dont understand why this is even being argued. The NSA is clearly collecting data, and they were doing so previously without our knowledge. It fits perfectly with one of the definitions of spying, even if it doesnt fit your personal definition (which wasnt wrong, it was just the first definition). Words can have degrees of meaning, and this clearly fits as spying or they wouldnt have hidden it in the first place. http://www.thefreedictionary.com/_/dict.aspx?rd=1&amp;word=spying"
TV Violence? Okay. TV Nipple? SAVE THE CHILDREN.
"Its shit like this that makes issues such as abortion and gay marriage the crux of an election when in reality they should be side-events. People can only be outraged by things they understand, I guess."
Obama lies about everything. Repercussions=Reddit heralds him as Americas savior just doing his best to clean up a bad mess he was handed.
"Whenever the heat gets turned up on Obama, you can always count on /r/politics changing the subject to Bush."
Yeah! Is it not just too funny why the remaining 96% of the worlds populous do not like the USA at all?!
"The Clinton impeachment was not at all about Clinton. After all, we were in the middle of one of the most prosperous times in the history of the US, and he was already in his second term. No... that impeachment was an attempt at swaying public opinion away from the ridiculously popular Clinton/**Gore** duo. They needed a way to secure victory in 2000, and the only way to do that was somehow shine a negative light on Gore. The whole political strategy for the Bush-Cheney ticket was in the works long before the 2000 election. In fact it started pretty much as soon as Bush 1 lost re-election and [Cheney was forced to re-enter civilian life.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2000/08/cheneys-multi-million-dollar-revolving-door) The impeachment gambit barely worked, requiring the Republican-led legislature of Florida to completely fuck the election results. I mean honestly, how much time, money and effort was put forth in seeking the truth about a mother-fucking blowjob? And what actually came of it in regards to its effect on Clinton while he was in office? Anything? Zero. Fast-forward to today, and the same thing is happening again except insert Benghazi. History and politics are just repeats of the same old shit. Republicans have no chance in 2016 unless they can squash Hillary. Look how ridiculous they were in the last cycle. Their primaries are a complete joke. Mother-fucking Michelle Bachmann, Hermann Cain? Are you kidding me? The Democrats dont really have any more viable candidate than Hillary at the moment, so thats why shes being targeted so heavily. Pay no attention to what the talking heads say about her not being a target regarding Benghazi. A bigger bullseye could not possibly be painted on her right now. Its blatantly obvious when Paul Rand comes out and says shes not fit for ever holding public office again. Politics, politics, politics. Its incredibly sad that were in this state. Republicans have no desire to actually govern and advance society. They are only concerned about finding ways to make the rich get richer and securing their own jobs. Thats literally all they want to do, hence the 100% obstructionism right now. If all they do is talk about Benghazi for the next three years without actually accomplishing anything, they will have achieved their objective: squash Hillarys chances in 2016 and install yet another cluster fuck administration that will probably permanently destroy the economy. The whole thing is pathetic. All of congress needs to be replaced."
Now thats an I can get behind.
No one should ever be allowed to compare their mistakes to someone elses. It is the worst argument ever.
"And the one man on Earth with the most power to do anything about it. A man who is a constitutional lawyer in the most powerful position in the country did absolutely nothing about it. In fact, he had a meal with him and shook his hand, then told the country to look forward instead of trying to hold anyone accountable. This is why I boycott both parties."
"Obama lies about Fast and Furious!? I mean come on, Fast 5 is the best one."
Bush administrations lies about why we should go to war. Repercussions=? Clinton lies about getting a blow job. Repercussions=impeachment. Are you kidding me!??! No. 
"Repeating misinformation is quite different than creating misinformation, both morally and legally. "
"Obama administration, falsifies communications regarding Benghazi in order to deflect weakness prior to election. Obama administration is caught using the IRS to target political opponents. Obama administration wiretaps personal phones of AP reporters. Obama parties with celebrities. And thats just this week. So what does this flaming turd of a liberal blog do? They write some garbage about Bush and and spam it on Reddit. Typical progressive circlejerk ensues. Keep fiddling Nero. "
"Obama administration does their best to gets the facts right on Benghazi and largely succeeds... And where they were wrong they admit to it. Fuck it, hes black."
"I know. Its sad and pathetic, agreed. It kills me, but I couldnt resist to comment. What should we do? "
"To be fair, Clinton also lied about leading us into war. We just didnt pay much attention to that because the economy was good so only domestic stuff mattered. You will notice America only cares about foreign policy when our economy sucks. In sports they have a saying for this, winning covers a lot of problems"
 GOP REALLY doesnt like it when a Democrat is so rude as to be elected president. 
"But you see, Clinton lied while *under oath*. Bushs lies were never technically perjury, so theyre OK. In fact, we could say that Clinton is responsible for Bushs lies by creating the climate in which lying was seen as acceptable. The above is a real argument that people have tried to use with me."
How many of Bushs lies were under oath? honest question
"* Step one: Lie about impending danger * Step two: Go to war * Step three: Profit! Good news, we finally figured out the underpant gnomes second step!"
"If Bush lied, then so did [all these people](http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/wmdquotes.asp). Partial list, in case you dont feel like clicking the link: * Hillary Clinton * Bill Clinton * Bill Clinton?s Secretary of Defense William Cohen * Joe Lieberman * Barbara Boxer * Madeline Albright * Nancy Pelosi * John Kerry * Ted Kennedy * Al Gore * John Edwards * Tom Daschle * Dick Gephardt * Henry Waxman * John Rockefeller * Ex-Un Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter * Carl Levin **Now, you liberal trolls, downvote for truth!**"
&gt; Clinton lies about getting a blow job. Repercussions=impeachment Sanford lies about using state funds to go visit a mistress. Gets a blow job while no one knows where he is. Divorces his wife for the mistress. Violates a court order and trespasses on his ex-wifes property. Repercussions=Elected to the House 
"Republicans tried to crucify Clinton on his moral escapades. That failed, so they tried to get him to lie under oath. He did and thats how they got em. Id gladly accept a president that is a horn dog any day of the week compared to one that starts wars just because. THEY are the ones that need their moral compass checked."
Impeachment was filed against Bush
Why?
"You swear an oath when you take office. Somehow we need to find a way to make them back this shit up! The police police is and hold us as citizens accountable for our bad decisions. I guess this is why I dont understand less regulation, because business and politics literally get away with murder on a massive scale every single day."
"Calm down, shitizen, the people in power decide what to do and when to do it. Dont make the mistake of believing you have any control over the decisions made. "
Bush really needs to be tried for treason.
It gets better..... They want to impeach Obama because he didnt call Bengazi terrorism fast enough. Worthless shit stains on society......... 
"Yeah but your dumb ass is probably to dumb to realize or even care that Clinton tried more than once to invade Iraq. You seem to think that Democrats are good and Republicans are bad. They are are both equally worthless. They are two heads of the same coin and your dumb ass falls for it every time. Heres a brief little history lesson for you, they were the same fucking party, and split in two to monopolize the political process. Your dumb ass thinks you have a two party system. You have one party under two different names. You: Wars started by Bush bad. Wars started by Obama good. Me: Doesnt fucking matter, war is bad period."
Shah. 
That is an interesting case. There seems to be a lot more than meets the eye. Why did it happen when it did? Why was the case brought to attention even though FBI investigators found no illegal conduct...hmmm
"Clinton cheats on his wife, no repercussions. Patreaus cheats on his wife, forced to resign. (Conveniently timed right after Benghazi)"
"Obama blatantly lies to the public about Benghazi?! Repercussions? NONE. I mean, come on."
Clinton got impeached? Guess I missed that part.
"This is not a fucking partisan issue. The two party system is straight up divide and rule. The entire Bush administration should be in prison, and Obama should be the one to prosecute them. They are all on the same team. Its a big club, and you aint in it! - George Carlin "
also: Benghazi.
The high water mark about all of this for me was when Dennis Kucinich was trying to get Bush impeached there was a particular day where Kucinich got his 23rd or 25th co-signer for the impeachment bill AND John Stewart had Bill Clinton on his show. This happened on the same day. Anyway Stewart just softballs Clinton through the whole interview and never once asked the question you are discussing. If Stewart had asked Clinton what he thought about being impeached for his behavior meanwhile Bush was busy murdering people and lying about it without zero repercussions whatsoever then I think it would have blown the lid off of the media blackout on Kucinichs impeachment activities. It would have made a difference. I lost all respect for Clinton and Stewart both that day. Not to mention the entire democractic party. That was the day they all lost my support forever. Havent watched the daily show since.
"Nobody was serious about the impeachment. Thats why the sent Ken Starr, instead of a real lawyer. "
"Thats because there were other justifications for those wars. And please dont downplay what Clinton did... even if youre doing so for good reasons. Having an affair, then lying under oath, tells us A LOT about a persons character. Losing that trust was a huge deal. We should remember it as such. "
How many false statements have been made by Obama and his aids regarding Benghazi?
"Clinton perjured himself while in office. Honesty and integrity are the most important requirements for President to the American people. Bush had amazingly high approval ratings during his call to war until it declined around his second term. HoR was Republican controlled until 2006, so he got away with a lot. Both lied to the people, one was caught while in office and one wasnt. Even if the Dems had substantial evidence for false reports on WMDs, they wouldnt have been likely to act on it. No one wants to contest a President with over 90% approval rating, its political suicide and sadly this is why were just now getting reports of how bogus the executive branchs claims for war were."
Stupid. Sometimes. Throw them all out? How? Im game. 
Why are you all so stupid as to believe one side is any better than the other? Throw them all out.
Bush never used the US military to help his marriage. 
"Oh fuck off with that one. Clinton: - Allowed Iraqis to be starved through sanctions. Albright then said this was a justified action on 60 Minutes. **Lie #1: Children are sacred.** - Blew up the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing 4, hunting terrorists with NATO-banned B2 bombers. **Lie #2: The international community loved America under Democratic leadership.** - Chose Janet Reno, known across the country as the adjudicator during the brainwashed children sex cases allowing for the arrest and incarceration of many innocent people at the hands of child therapist with an agenda. **Lie #3: Under Clinton, the media was all about objectivity and the Department of Justice was all about justice.** - Let the ATF press charges against their own undercover agent, Carol Howe, after it is revealed she knew and attempted to warn the government about plans to bomb the Murrah building. **Lie #4: The government valued and appreciated good intel during the 90s.** - Murdered the Branch Davidians through an extremely silent White House during the suffocation of allegedly abused children at the hands of a militarized FBI. **Lie #5: The Federal Government is a benevolent state in the hands of a popular Democratic president.** Overall, the lies of Clinton killed as many, or more, than Bush, with far more domestic killings done in the name of Homeland Security. Under his administration, the PATRIOT act was concocted in the months leading up the Oklahoma City Bombing by now Vice President Joe Biden as the Omnibus Counterterrorist Act of 1996. Let it not be said that Clinton only got a blow job when we discuss his heinous and malformed presidency."
"Oh heres a little tid bit of info for your Dem loving ass. More people have died in wars while Democrats were in office than Republicans. Most wars the US has fought were started while Democrats were in office. Oh yeah if you want to talk about Clinton getting impeached a blow job, if he cant even be true to one person, his wife, how truthful do you think hes going to be to a country. Oh yeah and I know the down votes aer coming for this but dont give a fuck, so just to get you fucktards started I gave myself a downvote, have a nicee day."
"didnt say i liked him, just glad somebody did something useful for a change. probably an asshole like everyone else but ill take any good news these days."
"its America, prepare for a bad outcome. national register of same sex marriage troops... later used to kick them out of the army or whatnot. I always expect the worst when America tries to apply common sense."
"Wait, /r/politics likes Chuck Hagel all the sudden?"
My only concern is my understanding of how national guard works. If we were at war then he would be in their chain of command. But in peacetime I thought national guard units command line ended at the governor of their state. 
Good. Somebody in charge making some goddamn sense.
As a Nebraskan im glad something from the state is looking positive in the news.
"I think its more a matter of this being the only feasible option. If you let it vary by state youd open up a huge can of worms: Gay service members wouldnt want to serve in certain states if they knew it could affect their benefits. But in the military you dont always get to choose where youre going to serve. Also, certain assignments may be better for promotion and if one is in an anti-gay marriage state that would force the service member to potentially miss out on benefits due them to remain competitive in their career. If youre familiar with how the military works and try to think through options that would let the states dictate marriage for service members youll quickly realize that theres really no way to do it. Either you find yourself codifying discrimination in a manner thats pretty obvious (and vulnerable to legal challenge) or youre vague, leave a lot of it up to the states, and end up with an incoherent patchwork of rules thats nearly impossible to administer."
"I dont know anyone who is going through the same-sex benefits process in the regular army, but its been officially open to homosexuals for a few weeks now. "
"Hagel actually wore the uniform. He may have some hinky shit, comes with being SecDef, but he knows his shit."
"it should be noted that he is a republican. I mainly say this, not because republicans tend to be homophobes and anti gay marriage but because people seem to be blissfully unaware that dems do that. Dems always put republicans in charge of defense. It is a right wing post.[ Obama has a record number of republicans in his cabinet.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/10/barack-obama/Three-Republicans-Cabinet-Most/) (but he is the partisan one.. Obama has a republican sect of commerce, transportation and defense and the right still filibustered gates because everyone gets filibustered under Obama) The right dont do this. The right never put dems in charge of the labor or the EPA or anything else that is seen as left wing bush head of hud.. republican.. epa republican, labor, republican.. sect of health cand human services .. republican. He did have one dem, the head of transportation. But they never put a dem in charge of anything seen as left wing. The dems always have a republican defense sect."
just let me believe that somebody with power decided to do something good for once. why cant this happen ever?
you mean like the democrats do with absentee ballots from our US Soldiers serving over seas? Republicans want to disenfranchise welfare parasite - THE OUTRAGE Democrats want to disenfranchise US Soldiers serving overseas. - OH WELL!

"COME ON, WATSON."
The reality is this story is probably going to get drowned out tomorrow when the Supreme Court announces its same-sex marriage decision. 
The first rule of parliamentary procedure is you can make up parliamentary procedure apparently.
"So from looking at the senate rules, I found this precedent: The point of order having been raised for the third time that a Senator who had the floor was filibustering and not confining his remarks to the bill before the Senate, the chair requested the Senate to vote on the point of order. It was sustained and the Senator speaking yielded the floor (44 S.J. Reg. 1780 (1935)). Does that mean the second strike shouldnt have counted? Does anyone speak parliamentarian?"
This is the first time Ive ever considered the Legislature interesting.
Watson is on some Game 7 clutch right here. 
Set that aside for a moment. ILL COME BACK TO THAT TO STALL FOR MORE TIME!
Pretty sure they have given up at this point. This is amazing
What happens if she leans on the desk? Do they take the mic from her?
Wow...they really have the parliamentarian digging through the books now...shit just got real. LOL

"I think Wendy needs to change her name to Sherlock, because she just found her Watson."

Wendy was pitching a no hitter and the Republicans bunted in the 9th inning.
"a comment on the live feed site by ungeheier: The internet is watching, we? need to turn the audio off so we dont look like complete morons "
I would like to remind everyone that Rick Perry fought to give rapists visitation rights to see their rape babies and by extension their rape victims.
@AaronFrancoYNN: Our reporter on the floor says some Republicans arent sure whether they actually voted to pass #SB5 or on previous question. #txlege Isnt that what passed around 11:56? To move on from e previous question? How could they have taken a vote
"So basically, my elected representatives just decided to fuck the rules. "
"If their Senate rules are anything like the national Senate, she can yield for questions and still not yield the floor. During the question she may sit or lean. If she has any friends in the State Senate, theyll be prepared to pepper in some breaks for her. "
"its shit like this that I dont understand At one point, the bills sponsor, Republican Rep. Jodie Laubenberg of Spring, errantly suggested that emergency room rape kits could be used to terminate pregnancies. how are they representative leaders, either thats representing an ignorant illogical populace or she isnt doing her job right."
"It boggles my mind how shortsighted people can be. Im all for personal responsibility and understand having sex very well can lead to a baby, but no matter how much we can say wait till marriage, wait till you are financially stable to have sex, it isnt going to happen. Closing abortions clinics will not save the state money. If someone gets pregnant who can not afford a child, and now can not have the means to have an abortion, the state is going to be paying A LOT more money for the next 18 years to care for this child, then had the women been able to have an abortion. Lets not also forget about medically necessary abortions as well, for either the life of the mother, or knowing that a baby is going to be born with a chronic disease, or other serious medical problem. "
This is unbelievably fascinating to watch..
"He should just start defining words- A sonogram is..., Germaneness is, according to the book..., etc."
"Watson- This is just some crazy, fucked up shit."
Texan Republicans cant wrap their heads around the idea of midnight yet claim to have a really good handle on the exact moment life begins.
Does Watson have a time limit on closing the debate?
The reason no one knows what has happened is because right now the Texas Senate has no idea what the hell it did or didnt do.
"Let me try to explain this for everyone: The Texas parliamentary rules allow a filibuster to be prematurely ended after three successful specific points of order, two of which are 1) if the person carrying out the filibuster speaks on a subject that is not *germane* - that is, related to the bill under discussion - or 2) if the person carrying out the filibuster accepts physical aid from anyone else (as it was ruled accepting the back brace was) or sits down, etc. The Republican chair made a ruling on a point of order that may only be overturned by a majority vote (**thus, invalidating the entire point of a filibuster**, the purpose of which is to *survive* a simple majority). The Republicans unfairly (i.e., entirely against their own Rules of Parliamentary Procedure) acted to table the filibuster, which would allow them to move forward with regular business and proceed with a vote. You would have to hold a legislative session in the utter absence of decorum to rule that sonograms are not germane to a discussion of abortions. According to Texas own rules: germaneness is not a precise concept. To institute such a strict definition of germaneness is to scrap an entirely legitimate filibuster in order to get their way. tl;dr: in Texas, the filibuster might as well not exist if you accept the Republicans ruling on germaneness. "
Citizen assisted filibuster. Is this a first?
ITS OVER Special session ends with no vote on abortion bill - http://www.wfaa.com/ -Local News Station
"Either way, Im proud for the first time in a long time to be a woman in America. I hope its the first of many women in politics who speak up."
Holy crap this lady is making him shit his pants in having to explain himself.
"http://m.statesman.com/news/news/abortion-rights-supporters-pack-senate-for-filibus/nYTn7/ Today, Wendy Davis, a Texas State Senator from Ft. Worth, will filibuster for 13 hours straight, with no breaks. She cant even lean on the desk she stands next to. All to kill Rick Perrys anti-abortion bill that could close all but 5 clinics in the state. "
If this doesnt become a movie Ill eat my hat. 
THIS IS THE MOST FUN IVE EVER HAD WATCHING THE SENATE
it will be brought up instantly as a law voted on outside of session which means that any jury and any judge should automatically kill the law if they even have a brain

Shit theyre trying to say she went off topic. 
I CANT HEAR YOU OVER ALL THAT FREEDOM IN THE GALLERY BITCH
Sen. Rodney Ellis is climbing my hero chart right now 
Did they just say the measure was adopted?
If we can get order in the chamber we will suspend the vote until we get order in the chamber. lolwut
"The chair looked for someone to call sine die - Latin basically meaning to suspend indefinitely. (Looking to dismiss everyone to go home until the next legislative session is called.) EDIT: West was basically like, No, you cant do that so they could talk about how the final roll-call vote was taken after midnight (constitutional point of order is what you heard him say earlier.)"
"In truth, its a loss for the GOP either way."
From Youtube: I feel like Rains of Castamere will start playing any time now.
"the cheering is so intense, but can it last?"
"Watson reads the ACTUAL rules and whips his glasses off, like a boss!"
"People in attendance are chanting, LET HER SPEAK! And now theyve just killed the mics in the room. Edit about twelve seconds later: The audio is back up. The silence may well have not been intentional."
"Agree or not, thats fucking dedication."
"I have never in my life been so fascinated by Texas. Also. Wendy Davis for the fucking win. Leticia Van De Putte with the assist. I have no idea what is going on in that room right now and I have no idea who won and who lost, but I know that those two women made themselves heard."
This guy is a fucking moron if we can get order in the chamber we will suspend the roll call vote until we can get order in the chamber

he just refused to answer her 
"The amount of rules they had in writing, that they blatantly disregarded and broke, is disgusting."
"Dont let anybody tell you all of Texas is regressive and ignorant. There are good people everywhere, but the ones who are willing to stand up and stick their necks out in a hostile environment are too few and far between."
So were allowed to move on despite the fact that one of those strikes wasnt based on germanes cause they decided about it a long time ago? Wow
Keep it up crowd... for safetys sake Id say they should go until 12:10 at the earliest just so that theres no nonsense about which clock is accurate... Nobody can argue that the official clock is anything other than a minute at best off of the real time... :-)

"As a Texan, Im pleasantly surprised to see that there are a number of state senators willing to help out the filibuster by stalling with so many procedural questions. I dont usually follow this kind of thing, but I had assumed that Senator Davis would be on her own. Edit: grammar. "
Theyve been looking over this rule for over 15 minutes. Unbelievable. Major high-five to Watson for the assist.

Its ridiculous that our government runs like this. Kudos to her though... fuck Rick Perry.
"My thoughts are as follows: the secretary started the vote before it actually took place, at 11:59, just to be sure the Republicans could squeeze it in before the lock. The real vote, when the secretary began speaking and noted by the clerk, didnt start until 12:02. "

"&gt;The record for the longest filibuster goes to U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, according to U.S. Senate records. &gt;Thurmond began speaking at 8:54 p.m. on Aug. 28 and continued until 9:12 p.m. the following evening, reciting the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, President George Washingtons farewell address and other historical documents along the way. Thurmond was not the only lawmaker to filibuster on the issue, however. According to Senate records, teams of senators consumed 57 days filibustering between March 26 and June 19, the day the Civil Rights Act of 1957 passed. muh 13 hours"
Its nice to see a woman I voted for using the GOPs tactics against them. Go Wendy!
This woman is a hero.
To me this goes past the issue of the bill she is protesting. Does it not speak to the ridiculousness of the current state of politics that they took her seat away and she cant so much as lean on the desk or take a break? How does any of that have the best interests of the people at heart. To me that makes the entire senate look like a joke of an institution.
YOU CAN DO IT WENDY!
If men could get pregnant thered be drive-through abortion clinics on every corner...
I now have a representative from Texas that is WORTH going out of my way to vote for.
Good luck to her!
Good. Knock this stupid ass bill right out of the running.
"This is more important than most people realize. The abortion laws passed in the last few years are a nationally coordinated effort of the religious right, intended to overwhelm the opposition and the courts, and written from templates provided by the evangelicals anti-abortion organization, Americans United for Life. What far too many dont recognize is that most of those laws and the efforts to pass them is defiance of our Constitution, the rights it guarantees, and the Supreme Court decisions that confirmed those rights. Thats betrayal of the oaths of office to support and defend our Constitution. "
"The constitution says abortion is legal. Republicans want to go against the Constitution. Instead of outright banning abortions in Texas, Texas Republicans are looking to close abortion clinics by changing the rules, causing 80% of clinics to close, leaving only 5 clinics for all of TX. This will also end up raising the price for an abortion. In the end, it will mean less access to abortions (especially in rural areas) and, most likely, more tax money spent on government support of these parents and children when they are born. I was there protesting on Sunday and I will be there again tonight to support Wendy Davis."
"Outstanding. I hope she can swing it.. Edit: for the record, Im pro-life. Not rabidly so. Ill never stand out in front of a clinic with a bullhorn. I wont badger anyone. If it was someone I knew, Id try to talk them out of it, but Id respect their choice. Thats what this is all about. Having a choice. Also, those clinics also provide birth control and OB-GYN services to women at risk."
"On the one hand, the filibuster is a frankly *fucktarded* political tactic, I mean just incredibly stupid bureaucratic wank. On the other, this is a vile, stupid, pompous piece of legislation with enormous negative outcomes and no consideration to the consequences. I guess what Im saying is, yall are pretty fucked, but I would buy that lady a drink."
Im still waiting for my reimbursement from Rick Perry using my tax money to remodel his house. 
"To those saying that Abortion is wrong because its murder and babies are innocent victims: First of all, Murder is TOTALLY okay under multiple circumstances, there are a zillion scenarios where it is absolutely within the law to kill someone against their will. Some people are awarded fucking MEDALS for it. Im not saying murder is nice or right or whatever, Im just saying that if you claim abortion should be illegal because its murder, that argument does not hold up in the U.S.A. As for the I want to save the babies argument: Why is it okay that 33% of ALL PREGNANCIES (read: billions of people) meet their demise through natural miscarriage before being born? There is no one marching to save them, or to shame their mothers. No one reminds the world that these babies are dying and have experienced pain and EVERYONE needs to intervene. How many old white guys are losing their shit over what has been an accepted part of humanitys reproductive pattern (losing 33% of fertilized eggs/pregnancies to miscarriage?) Oh - thats right, none. Why? Because it is totally okay with these people if natural forces (ie - not HER) cause a woman to miscarry (which by the way, is presumably equally painful for fetuses as abortion) but it is NOT okay for a woman to compel the same process to occur in her own body. So: If your sympathy truly is for saving babies, there are a zillion times more babies dying via natural miscarriage then there are babies being willingly aborted. Shouldnt this be the focus for all the effort from the Pro-Life camp? Shouldnt Pro-Life people be outraged that women are even allowed to attempt to conceive after 6, 8, 10 repeated Early pregnancy losses? Shouldnt they say: A women who has that many miscarriages has inadvertantly caused the death of 6, 8, 10 babies and should not be allowed to try again in order to prevent the likely death of additional babies? Shouldnt they be pushing for homicide investigations for all miscarriages? Shouldnt they be burying their own miscarried babies with full funeral service? Shouldnt they be absolutely devastated to hear when someone has had a miscarriage? Why arent the masses lobbying to investigate this phenomenon? Why are there no investigations into miscarriage as possible neglect or homicide? Why are there not millions of bull-horn blowers bawling their eyes out in front of hospitals for miscarried babies? Are miscarried babies not as important as the aborted ones??? Did they not endure the same (alleged) pain as an aborted baby? The difference, plain and simple, is that pro-life (pro-birth) people do not think women should have the same power to influence the outcome of her pregnancy that nature has. A bona - fide Baby Saving Operation would be focused on how to save as many babies as possible from demise. The Pro-Life operation does not focus on this. Instead, it focuses on How to Force Women to give Birth against their will. Personally, I think the supposed grief over aborted babies and concern for fetal happiness is a sham. Its clear that the focus is on a means of pregnancy demise that actually accounts for a VERY low number of dead babies when compared to other (natural) causes. I know of many, many women who have had early miscarriages and have not cried about it or even given it much thought. But a woman who admits to a remorseless abortion???? look out. Here come the Shame Police, who will gladly cry for her dead baby Its bullshit. Its an effort to disallow women control over their own bodies. Period. Dead babies has nothing to do with it. You go, Wendy Davis. Maybe you can offer Rick Perry the opportunity of examining your vagina for signs of pregnancy before you proceed. A 13 hour filibuster could have adverse effects on an unborn fetus, and of course, Uncle Rick only wants whats best for them."
Its sad that this is necessary.
My Fellow Fort Worthians are doing it right.
Im located in Austin. Does anyone know if this session is open to the public? I know sometimes they are and sometimes they arent. Id love to go watch her for a bit!
"The Constitution says abortion is legal. Republicans want to go against the Constitution and they arent hiding it. The bill is masquerading as improving the quality of care, but they are only talking about preventing access to abortions. They are lying and attacking the Constitution."
So...are we for or against filibusters now?
"http://wendydavisforsenate.com/standwithwendy/ If anyone has an abortion story theyd like to share--personal or not,-- shell be reading them during her filibuster. "
She is aloud to yield to questions so other senators could ask her to yield and they could give her a break this way.
"Regardless of her intentions, goddamn do I hate filibustering. Its one of the stupidest things our political system allows."
Wendy Davis is a BOSS. Fuck Rick Perry. 
"I never had to make this decision and never will have too but I think women deserve a real doctor, clean clinic without hassle from people. I think Plan B or whatever its called should be OTC, I think money for clinics that give birth control, paps such things are well worth the money. More power to this lady!"
Someone standing up on principle for what they believe. Bravo!
Excellent. We can finally hear the script for the sequel to Marvel vs Star Wars.
"Im sick of all these people trying to control other peoples lives because they dont agree with them (specifically abortion and homosexuality). Personally, I dont particularly like abortion, but all it means to me is that Im not going to get one. Its as simple as that. Women know there are alternatives, but no matter what they choose, its not going to be easy for them. People need to back the fuck off and mind their own business. "
What the fuck? Why is this how we have to get shit done in congress? Fucking games.
"Everyone is claiming shes a hero, but when Rand Paul filibustered, everyone cried about how the GOP filibustered to get there way. Rick Perry still represents about half of the population in Texas, whether you like abortion or not. Theyll mindlessly obey his commands too. Yawn."
Fuck you Rick Perry!!!!!! 
Someone get /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza on this. People sent pizza to Rand Paul during his filibuster and I think Wendy Davis deserves the same treatment. Nothing like showing your appreciation for someone by sending them enough deep-dish pizzas to last for a month.
"Its ridiculous that this is a legitimate tactic. Edit: I assume the downvotes are because people think I disagree with what shes doing. To be clear, Im all for it. Fuck those guys. I support the right to choose. I just think its ridiculous that that is a legitimate tactic for deciding things in our legal system. "
"As a Texas, I can say Perry sucks ass. "
"I live in South Texas where the nearest Abortion Clinic is 4 hours away. Dear Sweet Jesus, I have never seen so many young mothers. 21 year old girls with Middle School aged children."
"Man, Abortion is tough for me. My conservative side wants to make it illegal because I truly believe its ending a life, but my Libertarian side wants me to let people make decisions for themselves. "
Im glad someone is standing up against these ignorant assholes.
"Given that this is Texas, why not just pass a law stating that all abortions must be carried out with a handgun? Theres no way in hell Texas Republicans would be against abortion then."
Senator Wendy Davis is a bad ass. 
"Just watched a couple of minutes of the live feed. Time for me to go to bed here in Blighty, otherwise Id watch some more as a (somewhat feeble) show of solidarity. What you Americans have to put up with because of your fuckwit fellow American fundamentalists."
You go girl! 
"Im donating $5 to NARAL and $5 to EMILYs List for each hour Sen. Davis speaks. Im also offering to match donations from my facebook friends to any other abortion rights organization, to the best of my financial ability. "
"Although I am an atheist, morally, I am opposed to abortions. I wont go at length as to why I feel this way, but there it is. However, I recognize that this is a personal moral, one that (probably) roughly half the population disagrees with. This being the case, I have absolutely no right whatsoever to force my belief on anyone else, especially about something that has such large real world implications and consequences. We all know the issues with banning out clinics such as Planned Parenthood. How can a person, who is fully aware and knowledgeable of the consequences, still claim to stand on the moral high ground and force those implications into reality, condemning thousands of REAL world lives in the name of you not wanting to feel uncomfortable with it? This is the question I pose to Governor Perry and those of his ilk. I personally would never vote in favor of abortion. My morality would not allow it. Nor would I vote against it, for my morality would not allow that either. I may personally disagree and feel uncomfortable about something, but that doesnt mean I get to dictate actions that have never and will never (I would think) affect me. Morality should *never* be the sole basis of writing law. It can be argued that even things like murder, theft, or rape isnt illegal on solely moral grounds; these actions are all extremely detrimental to individuals AND society as a whole. What detriment does abortion inflict on society? On me?"
"Like it or not, its a shame that this is the tactic that must be used to kill a bill."
Sending positive vibes her way!
She just got a warning :/
Who the hell is this white haired balding guy who continues to call her out?! 
"come on people, get the word out and watch the filibuster online. The Republicans are launching an attack on Davis with a constant stream of germaneness appeals. "

Never heard of this woman but she sounds like a regular bad ass... 
SUPPORT THIS WOMAN!
"No food, no drink, no bathroom breaks, 13 hours worth. I hope she runs against fucking Rick Perry and murders him."
No one likes abortion. But who are you to say what someone does in private with their things. Especially with their things they dont want. Unless you have personally adopted a child I dont wanna hear that THEY HAVE ADOPTION Bull$hit. look into the terrible state of American orphanages and you can see for yourself the compassion of pro-lifers 
"Vote with your wallet, even if its just a dollar or 2 its the only thing that seems to get the other politicians attention in my state. I just donated. http://www.wendydavisforsenate.com/"
"If it were up to me abortions would only be regulated to unsure they were safe. Outside of that Id make them available at all times, with no cut off date. Even late term abortions. All these educated adults, writing laws based on religion, are the worst thing that has happened to our country, at the state and federal level. All these damn bible beating politicians make me sick."
Good for her. Im a Republican and I believe abortion is wrong but at the same time its none of my business to tell a woman what to do with her body and its about time people start minding their own business and stop telling other people what to fucking do.. The Republican Party and Conservatives have a lot of good ideas but they wont get anywhere until they give up this abortion and anti gay shit. Lets move on to the next century guys and gals. There is a New World Order and there is no room for that stupid shit anymore. 
Fuck Rick Perry. Can we get her to run for Governor?
"Heres my (male) take: if youre a man, stay the hell away from this debate. You dont get to tell a woman she cant do something with her body, especially because we NEVER have to go through the process of pregnancy and/or childbirth. Its so ignorant I could scream."
I hope she has the strength to go all the way. What about government not sticking their nose in your medical business. If they are clueless to the point of saying your body would take care of an unwanted pregnancy in the case of a legit rape; I say the should NOT give their darn opinion
"Oh Rick Perry! I remember that guy, hes the guy that wants state-sanctioned prayer day and cant form complete sentences. They let him make laws?"
"The Texas House and Senate are a terrible place of ignorance. They pay around $7500 over the course of 2 years for the positions, so you end up with nothing except peoples wives and rich assholes that have no idea what the average person needs."
About 85% of abortions happen within the first 12 weeks.
"No matter your opinion on this, I think we can all agree that David Dewhurst is a dick"
All this will do is have the back ally abortion clinics open up again or the coat hanger anortions will start happening again. This is only going to put more women in danger!
They are trying to end the filibuster because she put a back brace on.
"Its funny how the official Republican party line is no abortions and yet theyre also anti-social programs to help the poor. I find it ironic that the party will claim to care about people before theyre born and then turn around and tell them to suck it up or, essentially die, after theyre born. I applaud Wendy Davis and her one-woman effort to fight for the right to abort a pregnancy. A pregnancy for people who the Republicans demand carry to full term. A pregnancy that will cost a mother (and maybe even a father) a lot of money with no one to pick up the bill. A pregnancy whose child may one day be that loser bum that the Republicans hate. The one that theyd be happy to watch die homeless, sick, or starving..because its all about personal responsibility. All of these people talk about children like theyre all going to grow up to be valuable members of society. Thats not true. Some will grow up to be murderers. Some will grow up to leech off of the system. Some will grow up and have no discernable impact on society (good or bad). And yet if any todays unborn, magical, right to life collection of cells get to a point in life that they will need help, they would meet the cold, unfeeling shoulders of Republicans who will do nothing to lift a finger to help. What a sad, shitty joke."
Anybody got some info on the bills shes going after? Is it like the how wide are your hallways? stuff in other states? Or one of those fetal pain bills?
ones ability to stand should not dictate what laws are passed. I admire her dedication but the system is a joke and we should be embarassed.
Wtf? They are calling a point of order over if Senator leaned too much while being assisted with a back brace and the filibuster should be over
"I want to start an organization that funds transportation for women that need services that are going to be lost after this bill passes or if they would like to leave the state and help them start a new life in a different state that has stronger womens rights. If anyone would like to help or has any knowledge, please message me. Dont up vote, I just need more info from people with knowledge in this area and would like to start this as soon as possible. "

"Does anyone else think this sounds like a childish game, it just baffles me that theres a Survivor type challenge in State politics to do something reasonable."
She spoke at my high school graduation last year. She gives me so much hope.
"Question: if this bill passes, does that mean it goes into effect at midnight tonight? "
This is incredible. My utter respect to her. Sen. Judith Zaffirini is also serving some truths right now.
WTF! Politics are about whether or not she can sit or lean. WTF! Why is that more important than the issue. I had no idea so much time is wasted on meaningless details (traditions). 
Go Wendy! Thank you for your work!

[This is well documented](http://i.imgur.com/X4awta9.png) damn its gone now
Wendy Davis for Governor! 
"Im so glad this woman is doing this. It needs to be done. I would just like to point out how far up its own ass this sub is, though. Rand Paul got nothing but scorn for his filibuster, which also had a good cause behind it."
Who is running against Tommy Williams in 2014. He or she is about to get a campaign contribution.
No [leaning](http://i.imgur.com/WzRAdnq.png)!
Many of my friends and family members are in the building right now. One of my friends got a picture from inside the overflow chamber in the capitol building. http://instagram.com/p/bAHWkXr5kQ/ 
I love how the filibuster is being filibustered by the people in the senate. 
Go girl!
So can someone explain to me the rules here? I have a few questions that are confusing me on the matter. * Why cant anyone else also filibuster with her? Or can only one person filibuster a bill? * What exactly is she allowed to do other than talk? is she required to stand for 13 hours straight? * What are voting rules during a filibuster? I remember something about how votes can be made to end it or something of the nature.
Why couldnt a Senator that supports her stance ask her a bunch of questions to waste time?
She currently has 2 strikes against her for breaking the filibuster. One more strike and its over. She cannot receive assistance from others (earlier one strike from help with her back brace) and she must stay on topic.
The Lt Gov is a Republican I am assuming for being such an ass?
Texas is such a fucking horrible place that one of the few sane people in charge is doing such an arduous task for something that shouldnt even be an issue. God bless this fucking horrible country. 
"If you are in Texas, please consider sharing your story or a friends story on not only abortion, but womens health issues in general. She needs these to keep her filibuster going. 500 words or less! http://wendydavisforsenate.com/standwithwendy/"
"Fuck Rick Perry. Seriously, fuck that guy."
"I think the focus of the argument should be less about the morality of abortion and more about whether this law is driven by religious beliefs. Lots of people believe that life begins as early as conception and to terminate it amounts to murder. Those people have every right to that belief. But, those who believe differently must have their rights respected, too. In my opinion, to pass a law that forces everyone to adhere to one set of religious moral standards, even if the overwhelming majority agree, would be a complete trampling of the rights of the people who believe differently and should therefore be considered a direct violation of our first amendment. Regrettably, the belief of many is that Gods law trumps human law, thus making the beliefs of others, and our inalienable rights, irrelevant. I dont expect that my shpeel will change anything, I just wish to voice my own opinion, as is my right. My opinion is that the fact that were even entertaining the idea of a law based solely on religious arguments is absolutely ridiculous, given that the documents upon which our country was built, the very ones for which an entire war was fought, made it inescapably clear that there is to be a separation of church and state for no reason other than to protect our freedom to practice, without persecution, whichever religion we choose. "
Reminding everyone inspired by Wendy Davis to support organizations that help women run for office. Some examples: * [EMILYs List](http://emilyslist.org/) * [She Should Run](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/) * [Womens Campaign Fund](http://www.wcfonline.org/)
"The Texas Democratic representatives in the state House and Senate have been absolute heroes all week. Its been sass and kicked ass at every hearing. Im ashamed to say that I believed the negative stereotypes and didnt know there were strong women and Dems working in MY OWN state, but Im so happy and inspired to see them in action and know theyre there all the time, fighting for me even when Im not in their district and cant vote for them."
"She is now operating under two Point of Objection orders, one more and she will be stopped. Three hours and 45 minutes to go...alpha as fuck. "
Go get em Wendy! Show the Wingnuts that reason isnt dead yet!
"To those that dont understand how this bill will close womens clinics that also perform abortions: The bill requires that all doctors performing an abortion have admitting privileges to a local hospital. Seems reasonable on the surface. Wouldnt it be in the best interests of a womans health for her doctor that performed an abortion to be able to treat her for any emergency at a local hospital? Scratch the surface just a little bit and you will quickly see that thats not the case at all. To begin with the assumption has to be made that a local hospital even exists and if it does that she cant receive any emergency care there besides the doctor that originally performed the abortion. Many clinics are in rural areas (Texas is a big state) with limited access to ambulatory services and if complications do occur she can be treated by any attending emergency doctor at any hospital so there is no real need for admitting privileges(AP). AP are not automatic. It can only be granted by hospital administrators and is usually restricted to specific procedures. In addition, hospitals that are non-profit religious based will deny AP to any doctors that perform abortions. If you do the slightest research it becomes apparent that a lot of hospitals have become associated or bought up by religious organizations and have agreed to abide by their religious restrictions despite the views of the doctors themselves. Okay, so just go to another hospital you say? Its more than likely there isnt one unless youre lucky enough to live close to a county hospital and even then, I wouldnt go there if my life literally depended on it. Lastly, the bill requires a clinic that performs abortions be compliant with the same standards of a surgical clinic. I would be on board with this especially in the wake of the horrific conditions uncovered with the late abortion clinic. Im not because abortion clinics, along with dentists, podiatrists and a myriad of of other specialists perform minor surgery in office settings and comply with these codes. They are only making a special exception for gynecologists that perform abortions which reveals their hypocrisy. If a dentist that extracted an impacted tooth had to comply with these same laws then you should expect to have to go to a hospital. "
***WENDY DAVIS FOR PRESIDENT!***
Wendy Davis is a hero. Nobody likes abortions. Why would anyone want to get one? The point is that all women deserve the right to choose whether or not they get one. 
You can donate on her campaign site. http://wendydavisforsenate.com/
Why do I suspect that some Republican might call a point of order on bogus grounds just to get the vote in now?
"If men could get pregnant, there would be an abortion clinic at every corner between Starbucks and McDonalds..."
"What I would love to see is a play, about the women of Texas taking a stand against this kind of legislation by refusing to have sex with any man until it is overturned. We could call it, Texastrata. In all seriousness though, I support Wendy and I hope she can go till midnight. This kind of legislation is so toxic to our country."
Leslie Knope? 
"Sitting here listening to a guy asking if she can read from an iPad because the rule says ... read from paper... Oh dear... Glad shes from Ft Worth, though, representing!"
Support Wendy Davis: http://www.wendydavisforsenate.com/ :D
My jaw dropped when they asked if shes allowed to read from anything other than a paper. This is idiotic. 
"Ive been watching this live, as a parent living in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Im not heavily invested in partisan politics, but I want to throw up and die having watched Republican attempts to deliver her warnings, eventually shitting on her Constitutionally justified necessity to filibuster. We MUST stop voting these people in. This is not the only way to run the show."
"Want to help Wendy? The thousands of people who are flooding the Texas Capitol to support Wendy could use a snack. Support a local business AND donate pizzas to the protesters. http://www.austinspizza.com/site/order/ Send it to: Texas Capitol 1100 Congress Ave Legislative Conference Center, Level E2, Room 002 Austin, TX 78701 Austins Pizza will call you to verify over the phone that its a donation and will send them over (dont forget to tip the driver). "
I hope she wasnt wearing heels.
"I could wish for her to run for Governor in Texas, I would find a means to vote for her in 2014."
Write her and tell her you support her.
Is there a way that we can show support without overwhelming her office with fan mail? I dont know how else to show her our appreciation...
"Congratulations America, you government makes decisions the same way radio DJs give away vans."
So whats the deal with not taking questions? If she yields for questions does she yield entirely? 
[deleted]
How long can she pause without speaking for?
What did she say to make them claim she went off topic? 
Relevant: http://chinadigitaltimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/89-63_tank_man_-_web.jpg
She rocks!!! Women of Texas you should be proud she is willing to do this for you!!!!!
"Best tweet Ive seen so far on this - from Jill Biden: *At 12:01 AM, CT, I predict Wendy Davis will give us the best mic drop the World has ever seen. #StandWithWendy*"
Is she on her third strike? What were her first two?
Holy shit they struck her out! Wow
This cant be real. What the FUCK.
FUCKING BULLSHIT HOW IS TALKING ABOUT ABORTION NOT ON TOPIC???
How can you be proud to pass a bill with such a bullshit technicality? 
Theres going to be a damn riot over this. 
What just happened?
Hell NO.
Let her speak.
"If I were to write a fiction book on the three reasons for the three strikes here, people would say that sounds too ridiculous."
"She spoke at my younger cousins high school graduation last year, and I wasnt totally convinced. I have to say she has definitely earned my respect during the last year though. This whole filibuster thing has brought her up a few more notches, and I hope theyre able to stop this bill...this is Texas though, so who knows."
Hillbilly minded people need to stay out of politics!
Kirk Watson is awesome
So is this guy going to continue the filibuster if this is a debatable motion?
Lets hear it for former Austin mayor Kirk Watson! 
"Because, you know, if its a legitimate filibuster about womens rights, the GOP has a dirty trick that they can use to shut it down."
...And now they will get rid of the people. Wow
"Now we have a random funeral story? Holy shit today has been intense. Its not looking good for Wendy right now though, so hopefully Kirks appeal goes through."
"Shes an amazing human being, my hats off to you Madam "
This is the best season of 24 Ive ever seen.
"Filibustering through the appeal, pretty awesome."
Not looking good for her now...
"Guys, Im starting to suspect the Texas Republicans dont intend to play fair."
are these people questioning the ruling of the 3 strikes purposely being redundant/acting like they know nothing in order to stall more time? I cant really tell what the aim is.
"This hurts to watch, these guys are just making shit up now. "
"Stupid question, but what the fuck does jermaines mean?"
An hour and 40 minutes is still a long time to go........
Wait - that guy just said that you have to digress from the issue 3 times... not that you had to have 3 warnings. She has only had her germane-ness called into question twice
I thought her leaning on the desk was debatable...
"They are altering the rules, pray they do not alter them further. "
3 strikes or not? I cant tell what they are currently debating. PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY jesus christ
Unreal. This should be required viewing for any student of civics and government.
Does she still have the floor?
This is actually a completely fascinating look into the intricacies of parliamentary procedure
"now we are in the nitty-gritty she has less than 3 hrs to go with 90K watching on the livestream at Yahoo [](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2Q8Hr0O20LY) She has lost 3 rulings and maybe seated But she has friends on the floor Forget God Bless Contribute to Wendy Davis re-election campaign - FORGET TEXAS; GO NATIONAL, WENDY! currently there is 96.5 thousand people watching Go WENDY"
Roberts Rules of Order are simple Mr. President. Please check the transcript!
It seems he cant speak without that woman next to him telling him what to say... 
"Is there any way they can spin this out for another hour and a half? Anyone know whats likely to happen? :( Its 4.30am here, so I should probably go to sleep soon, but I cant stop watching!"
"Hey guys, lets all stand around and have a complicated argument about whether or not a woman can continue to talk about abortion... "
So what is exactly in order here? Watsons appeal debate should be on the floor right now right?
The chair is wrong. Hes wrong... wrong wrong wrong. ARGH. So Wrong. Re: the order of appeal vs. table. He stopped the appeal process before the proposer had relinquished the floor. Unless theres different rules in Texas... I guess. 
"Honestly, how did Estes (sp?) Motion to Table even get brought forth? Werent the sequence of events... Watsons Motion to Appeal and begin debate. The Senator who was attending her fathers funeral made a Parliamentary Inquiry. Then Estes spoke up. How is the chair confused on that?"
They gonna lynch that black man if he raises a point of order once more
I HAVE NOT MADE A RULING WAHHHHT.
"Is this Senator West or Ellis arguing with the chair about the ruling / not ruling? I cant tell, I just want to vote for him so hard. Edit: black guy in the snazzy blue suit"
"Is there a double filibuster going down right now or is this guy stalling OR is it a legitimate complaint, I dont know politics..."
How do these people take themselves seriously?
hey what do they do if you pee and shit yourself in the middle of a filibuster?
"Senator Watson just makes me want to cheer like a maniac. Edit: Okay, so Im bad with names. Sue me."
I am so confused right now. I just started watching. Can someone give me a run-down of whats gone on? edit: I really appreciate the replies. I think Im up to speed.
What *is* a motion to table? :S
I was under the impression a filibuster did not have to be on topic source: parks and rec Star wars Ep. VII
"I just got home. I need a quick hint at who I should be rooting for and booing for. Who is watson and estes? R or D? Thanks. If this bill passes, Im hopping in my car tomorrow and driving back to Texas to sit on a step or something. "
"It has to make it till 12 CST, correct?"
Watson dropping the mic.
So all of this only to come back tomorrow for another special session right? Fucking Perry.
ITT: Lots of people who should go study Roberts Rules of Order. [Handy Link](http://www.rulesonline.com/)
Davis is no longer standing at the podium. Is her part in this officially over now?
Well this is a clusterfuck and the acting chair is lost
"Not sure if this has been posted in this thread or not, but the Washington Post breaks down how Texas Republicans were able to stop the filibuster (for now): [link](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/25/wait-how-did-texas-stop-wendy-davis-filibuster/)"
IAE irritated by the comments from all of the people watching a time-delayed feed?
Question: Is there anything that says the GOP Senators cant vote to extend the special session past midnight?
"Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, moved to overturn Dewhurst?s motion. Duncan has taken Dewhurst?s place at the chair and is now talking about the decorum of the Senate. A lot of people in the gallery were escorted out after screaming ?NO? when the Campbell?s point of order was sustained. Duncan said if there?s another outburst they?ll request to clear the gallery. Hard to hear what anyone is saying above the shouts of ?shame? and ?let us in? from out in the hall. Van de Putte is asking what happened before she arrived. Killing more time on the clock. Less than two hours until deadline. ?Since I was not able to be here on the floor because of my father?s funeral, I ask that you tell me the three points of order so that I may understand even in the most basic way the debate about to begin,? she said.? Whitmire is arguing that the body would be allowed to vote on the final point of order. Sen. Estes moves to table Watson?s appeal. Watson raises point of order on Duncan?s decision to recognize Estes for his motion. (from http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/06/wendy-davis-begins-filibuster-to-stop-omnibus-abortion-bill.html/)"
"For all yall non-texans, Texas politics is pretty crazy. Just so you know."
"Not sure if its been said, BUT the main point of concern, is that the 2nd strike was not one of germane-ness, but that it was for the back brace. So, her 3rd strike that ceded her the floor was in fact the 2nd strike and she had a 1st strike for...oh wtf."
"God damn all these Mountain Time Zone perverts, I need to go to bed. "
Someone get Ed Hochuli in there to settle things once and for all
I AM SO CONFUSED! And Ive been watching this for hours... 
"I dont speak parliament, but I cant stop watching!"
I know Im right. YEP.
His excuse is that the ruling was sufficient to move forward? So fuck the rules basically?
"Up to 114,000 people watching this live now. Exciting!"
Confusion is my constant state of mind watching this. Legal speak is hard.
"Take your time, Watson. "
"And she has to stay on topic while talking. Even when the filibuster in DC was in the Good old days, you could read from a phone book and not even mention the bill you were talking about. I hate to say it, but Texas got something about governing right."
"Parliamentary Inquiry, Suckas."
Parliamentary inquiry
"So, in Texas, your filibuster has to remain germane to the bill, but your motions can ramble on about how everyone is your buddy? "
What happens if they draw out this debate for the next 40 minutes until midnight? Is the filibuster successful anyway then?
Oh my god. The US political system is so fucked...
Watson should get the MVP
this is crazy intense
How long does it take to vote and then tabulate that vote?
How can the Republicans stop Watson from speaking?
Can Watson start reading the transcripts and the text of the actual bill now?
Meta-filibuster!
So what happens if Sen. Watson goes off-topic? 
What people forget too is that Austin is the ultimate liberal city in the middle of this conservative fucked up state. I predict lots of Austin folks coming out to the capitol tonight.
[deleted]
The inception fillibuster....a fillibuster within a fillibuster. 
Is there a live feed available that is mobile friendly?
"Keep using parentheticals, Sen. Watson! I believe in you!"
35 minutes to go.
"How are they allowing Watson to speak this much? Is he still trying to bring up something to the chair? EDIT: Thanks, I see now"
Anybody know who the brunette lady in white is and what her job is? It seemed like she was telling that other guy (the president? lieutenant governor?) at the podium what to say or whats actually going on. Edit: Got it. Thanks guys!
Will there be a way to re-watch this entire thing? I kind of want to study it. 
30 minutes.
Ya the chair really screwed up here by taking so long to sort out the rules and thus giving Sen. Watson enough time to come up with 30 minutes of material to talk about. Serves him right. Claiming that an abortion related sonogram bill isnt germaine to a filibuster about abortion is ridiculous. And then attempting to table the appeal to this rule without allowing a vote or discussion about it!
I wanna give another example.
Remind me to call this guy whenever I get writers block on the last 5 pages of an essay.
I wish they would pan around the room so we can see everyones faces while Watson is bullshitting like a boss 
Kirk Germaneness Watson
I want Watson and Davis to adopt me.
What just happened? 
Why do they keep taking away the floor? Are they trying to lose???
"Watson: (Basically, sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up, Estes.)"
FUCK YEAH BLACK GUY WHOSE NAME I DONT KNOW.
REDUCE IT TO WRITING!!!1
"Put that shit in writing, sucka. LOL BIG FONT!!!"
"Man, no wonder nothing gets done during special sessions in Texas."
Why did Watson have to stop talking? 
"Thats her in the white suit still standing right? (not the lady next to the chair, there was a shot of another lady in the middle of the room) "
"Okay. This has got to be turned into a fucking movie. This has it all... high suspense, a good story, and all this parliamentary stuff can be explained by staffer characters through the film. This is awesome."
Theres no way any of this is valid anymore if brought up in a suit after today. The chair has fucked up so many times and continues to allow motions without the person talking yielding the floor.
25 fucking minutes left. Cmon this can be done. Damn all this effort just to let things stay the same. 
"Hmm... 5.35am... But theres only 25 minutes left, itd be silly to go to sleep now!"
Whos the woman in white whos always telling the President what to do? 
Are there enough people awake to vote? Do they all have to be present to vote?
How the fuck can the chair keep doing this if the floor is not yielded? Whats the point of it then?
"Poor Wendy, she is so tired and thirsty and needs to pee. Davis for Governor!"
Why are they taking roll call? 
Role calls are BAD.
Fucking bullshit
DAT YELL
YOU WERE NOT RECOGNIZED!
Fuck 20 minutes to go...
For people who hate big government Republicans really like telling women what they can and cant do with their bodies and who you can and cant marry
This is so fucking intense. Im so scared. 
Dat Fascism.
Did the chair just give in to the crowd pressure? Hahaha
Man the gallery is loud!
"You are recognized now. AFTER BLATANTLY IGNORING HER, YOU BASTARD."
You were not recognised *dat crowd boo* Recognised now
"Seriously, this chair is fucking up a lot."
This is a fucking joke. Bullshit.
Why is she reading roll call so faaaast
~~19~~ 18 minutes... And those fuckers are going to win. Im so annoyed right now. 
"Fuck, these fuckers are gonna pass it at the last minute arent they? "
Watsons back!!
What does the 5 seconds (names) mean?
"Parliamentarily inquire the fuck out of this, please!"
"I like you guys who want to reduce the size of government... make it just small enough so it can fit in our bedrooms. - Josh Lyman, The West Wing"
What I dont understand is what exactly happens if they vote in time to kill her filibuster? Couldnt someone else like Watkins just take up a new filibuster?
How come there are only 3 people making parliamentary inquires? Why isnt every Democrat in the building asking questions!?
YES VA DE PUTTE
DAMN!
OH SHIT SHOTS FIRED
OH SNAP
Love it
Omg I mute it for a second and then everyone is cheering like hell. What did I miss!?!?
Oh he really wanted to bang that gavel.
OH SNAP
Dont stop cheering until the capital police come in!
DAAAAYYYYUUUM!!!
"Dude, that was fucking badASS!"
APPLAUSE 
And here comes the applause.
Who decides who the chair is? i.e. Why does this wanker get to chair?
Oh no she didnt! Love this woman.
OH SHIT JUST GOT REAL
AND BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE 
KEEP APPLAUDING!
holy shit. 
THIS IS CRAZY
SHE FUCKING BURNT HIM HARD
"If the Senate President is so obviously ignoring the laws of the Legislature, is this truly allowed? "
Honestly the gallery may just riot if this goes through... such nonsense...
HOW CAN THEY VOTE! THEY NEVER AGREED TO END THE FILIBUSTER? 
God I hate Dan Patrick with the heat of a million suns. He is such a smarmy punk.
Audience filibuster?!
Turn up
isnt the chair suppose to be impartial?
Phrase of the night: Parliamentary Inquiry
Oh those bastards cut the mics.
"Ok, what the hell just happened with all the yelling??"
NO WE WILL NOT HAVE ORDER IN THE FUCKING CHAMBER
"If we can have order in the chamber? Im sorry, I cant hear you over all this FREEDOM!"
Keep cheering! Keep fucking cheering!!!
Is this vote on the legislation?
what are you watching this on?
And now all hell breaks loose...holy shit!!
Can they cheer for 12 minutes? 
Ahahaha. Is he trying to bargain with the audience?
I think the cheering will get us past the 12 minutes!
"Shall I raise my fucking hand, mr speaker?"
If we can get order we will suspend the vote until we have order
Are they trying to shout out the vote?
Dat 12th man.
wow... this is some crazy shit right here. Wish I could of gone to Austin tonight 
This will be the longest ovation ever. Keep it going!
Can the people carry it on home?!
What the fuck is the question??? What are they voting on?
NINE MINUTES.
Longest Oh snap! moment ever...
This is a groundbreaking moment in American politics. So glad Im watching this.
"Are they cheering, or being beaten to death by police?"
You fucking go girl 
Message to Texas elected representatives that pushed for this nonsense tonight... Theyre coming for you next time round... Those screams youre hearing? Thats the sound of a population that will stop at nothing to bring you down the first chance they have!
Theyre going all Cannes on their asses.
"If they carry on screaming, what will happen? Can they not carry on with the vote?? Surely they wont be able to forcibly remove everyone in 9 minutes?!"
The American public literally speaking up for their rights.
I believe the people would like to be heard! 
This is intense.
JUST START CHANTING USA! USA! UNTIL THE NEXT 7 MINUTES PASS.
This is absolutely incredible. I am so proud of you all in the gallery.
Im screaming at home. THEY CAN DO THIS!!!!
8 minutes!
This isnt live on any national news. What a farce.
"Such a beautiful sound... Fucking keep it up, people. Show these elected officials what you want in life and that youll fucking fight to get it."
God I love Texas. 
I wanna buy everyone a pizza!!!!
The gallery needs to keep it up!!!!
I suspect the chair will just declare the vote for the Rs. Then the poop will hit the fan.
"They still win I bet, they always do. "
Can anybody give me a TL;DR on whats happening right now? Whats the vote on? Thanks!
This is one of the most beautiful things I have witnessed. 
"Amazing scene, beautiful actually."
At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over her male colleagues in the room. And that was that!
This shows that one person can make a difference! 
is the stenographer getting all the screams?
Is the cheering actually doing anything or has the vote already gone and they just cant announce because of the noise?
"WENDY, WENDY, WENDY!"
This crowd should be the Time Person of the Year.
Yup - this is a future oscar winning movie.
alright the moment when the hollering gradually changed to shouts of wendy is when i lost it : )
Apparently DPS is forcing people out right now. 6 more minutes yall!
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! 
Texas: Great people. Stupid politicians. 
"Next we will see Perry trying to take away the gallery in the next special session, because there will be another one. Texas republicans are relentless at trying to take away womens rights. "
"Id love if they showed Senator Daviss face right now, knowing she caused this and them chanting her name."
Five more minutes!
Bwahahah. Look at that guy on the podium taking video with his camera!
Bah gawd for the first time since I cant remember Im proud to be an American
COME ON BABY HANG IN THERE
WENDY! WENDY! WENDY! WENDY! WENDY! GDI I am so fucking proud of Texas.
MURICA
Anyone more familiar with Roberts Rules know whether theyll be writing their votes instead of doing a roll-call in order to circumvent the crowd noise?
Look at the oranges cheering on the cheerers!
Talk about instant Nielsen ratings.
I cant tell if they are stalled or still going forth despite the pandemonium. 
"Fight, gallery! This is America!"
Listening to that gallery right now is truly inspiring. 
http://i.imgur.com/vwMin.gif
240 seconds... come on gallery
"Pretty interesting that in the end it came down to an a older white man, a black man, and a Hispanic woman saving this white womans noble crusade. "
Three minutes. Anyone not watching this is missng out on serious drama.
Where can I find the post game show?
If I can have some order... Fuck you.
"No sir, you can NOT have any order!"
Screaming starting to die down a bit If I can have some order Screaming doubles in volume.
&gt;If I can have some order Fuck you. 
lolz no you cant you twat 
"No,you may not have order."
"If i heard correctly: Mr. President, at what point does a female member of the parliament have to raise her hand to be recognized over the male members of the parliament? - Letician Van de Putte for the win."
Oh my god. That was the worst ending ever.
No. NO. Hes calling it for the Republicans anyway! NO!!!
This filibuster needs 30% more vuvuzelas.
What just happened with the 19-10 vote?
ORDER IS FOR SLAVES. FREEDOM ROARS
Can anyone explain to me the previous question votes?
I believe the president just declared the measure passed and left the stage. 
?Parliamentary inquiry? At what point must a female Senator raise her voice in order to be acknowledged over her? male colleagues in the room?? - Senator Leticia Van de Putte
"He called 19:10, is it legit?"
"Good fucking job, Texas. Im proud of you guys."
Boom midnight. 
did they just vote anyway?
This was more exciting than New Years Eve!
"FILIBUSTERED, BITCH."
Shame chant is a go.
Midnight.
"Look, when you decide to have no rules, then the mob takes over. "
SHE IS CALLING THE ROLL IT IS AFTER MIDNIGHT WHAT HTE FUCK
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
Wait did they manage the vote? 
How are they voting? Its after midnight? 
Theyre still trying to hold a vote. Were over two minutes past midnight. One senator is holding up a clock.
Theyre just voting anyway. They dont care. Its been pretty clear this night that everything is out the window.
what was the 19-10 vote?
Wow. I cant believe they are just going to vote anyways. Bastards. Just ignore what the people want. Typical
are they trying to vote after midnight? Wtf? they have a special ass hat watch? 
That was the most glorious 13 minutes of thunderous applause in history!
"As a Texan, I feel so much shame and pride all intermingled right now. "
"Come on guys, you really didnt think the game was over at midnight? These are politicians after all."
What the fuck?
The special session is over. No vote.
Brb up voting EVERY SINGLE PERSON in this thread. That was amazing 
Stoppage time voting?
Hes gonna look for a motion from Whitmire to what?? What the fuck is going on?
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING? DOES ANYONE KNOW?
They better fucking rip that place apart if they pass this bill.
"... aaand, theyre voting after midnight."
And here I stand thinking that Pennsylvania politics are screwed up... Texas you win today... This has to be the absolute worst abuse of power Ive ever seen... if you dont want to deal with filibusters then take them out of the constitution... Good God this is ridiculous...
"Of course, Perry will be calling another session tomorrow."
This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. 
"It is cool to watch democracy in action, but WTF is happening? :/"
Wait. Who fucking won?
Its just disgusting how the opposition has been steamrolled this last half-hour
report from a friend in the gallery says they passed it illegally... wtf?
Why is an Iron Man Physical Challenge a part of our senate?
If you try voting after midnight youre going to make Gremlins.
Rule 88.1b.4.$z: injury stoppage time will be added to the end of any special session at the chairs discretion.
So did the vote pass or not? I hear 19 Ayes and 10 nays. What is going on right now?
Are they seriously going to continue the vote at 12:07? Is that legal?
"Local Dallas ABC affiliate, WFAA Channel 8 just popped in with some live coverage. But they dont know what is happening at this exact moment, they are going over the events of the past couple of hours."
So.... Wendy is now officially presidential candidate material right? The talk will start tomorrow (today Texas time) 
"The poor woman is still on her feet, long after she should be seated. :("
can she sit down now? maybe have a whataburger?
Still being able to hear their cheers even after they left the main chamber... incredible.
Being reported now that the Democrats won.
"I need to go to bed, but I need closure more. Hurry up!"
"And the local Dallas ABC affiliate now returned back to regular programming, a rerun of omg! Insider talking about Paula Deen."
Every now and then people do have a voice.... Well done to the people in the gallery.
"Republicans are saying they voted. Democrats are saying the vote was after midnight. Still confusion on the floor wondering what actually just happened. Like a good orgy, the only thing we know is someone got screwed."
There has been a vote taken after midnight at the lectern. Report is 17-12 in favor of SB5.
The GOP hates empowered women.
Oh that doesnt sound good.
sounds like they are arresting someone in the gallery now. 
Let her go?
I need a live stream of the gallery for fucks sake
I think someones getting arrested.
Sounds like theyre removing people from the gallery. 
"And just like that, Texas Republicans defy time by pretending it is not past midnight at 12:13 am."

Republicans pass abortion bill as chaotic session ends DAMNIT -ABC affiliate http://www.wfaa.com/
The Associated Press ?@AP 2m BREAKING: Republicans pass new restrictions expected to close almost every abortion clinic in Texas.
Is it even legal to start a vote and continue it past midnight? Because if theyre trying to say it passed that is definitely what happened.

"Just got a tweet from the Gallery, it said they are forcefully removing people, police got violent with a guy, and just yelled that if they do not leave, they will arrest everybody. "
The AP just tweeted it passed.

[Republicans pass abortion bill as chaotic session ends](http://www.wfaa.com/news/politics/Abortion-issue-goes-down-to-the-wire-at-Texas-Legislature-212857491.html)
"If you are anti-choice, and you dont support having your taxes cranked up to care for all the unwanted little tykes your regressive social policies will bring into the world, you are far worse than these murderers you and your ilk rave about. You are a sadist to boot. If you believe feti to be souls, fine. Thats one thing. Pray for the mother and go on with your fucking business. Something in the bible about removing the own fucking log from your eye before pointing out the mote in someone fucking elses. But if you would rather see two lives ruined (child born into poverty and raised in brutal conditions for 18 years, assuming they live that long, with no opportunity for social mobility; mother forced to work for pittance to make ends meet) rather than zero (mother exercising rights over her own body), you are a fucking monster; done and dusted. No ifs ands or buts about it."

"&gt; State Sen. Wendy Davis was found to have violated three parliamentary rules with less than two hours left in her bid to block passage of a new law what 3 parliamentary rules?

Earlier in the evening, a fellow senator helped Davis put on a back brace, which angered some lawmakers who said it violated filibuster rules. That view was upheld in a vote, and she was given a warning. &gt;Before that, she had been ruled off topic. &gt;Davis was allowed three warnings before the Senate was to be allowed to vote on whether she must stop her filibuster."
LOL everybody thinking Texas is some kind of democracy... their state flower is the Gerrymander

Someone is speaking on the outside stream 
"From the UStream linked, people outside the chamber got quiet to listen to someone talk then a burst of cheering occurred. Seems the Bill didnt make it before midnight."

Time for random people standing nearby commentary. 
"On the feed from outside the chamber they said that since it wasnt midnight in ALL of Texas, it still counts."
"Apparently West will raise a Pt of Order when Dewhurst comes back to raise the timestape question, but no one knows where Dewhurst went. https://twitter.com/JasonWhitely"

rofl I dont want anymore senators talking. Theyre boring the fuck out of us. This is fucking lame. Democratic gobbleygoop. Keep it classy.
"Did they ever call a vote to actually end the filibuster? I just reviewed the notes and didnt see it. The ruling was if she got 3 warnings (lets just assume those warnings were valid .. and at least 2 of them werent.) THEN they would put the vote to the body to end the debate. They never did that. They started the appeal to challenge the 3rd warning, then stuff happened, then tabled. Then procedural inquiries Then bedlam. Then called roll.. more yelling, then apparently they voted. But as far as I can tell they never voted to end the filibuster. Anyone have info on this?"
And the state legislature site has 6/25 as the date for the vote.
"Can someone give me some perspective on how big this is? Im in Texas. I used to live one mile outside Wendy Davis district. For me, this is enormous. (Hell, I just spent the better part of my afternoon watching a woman talk about gestational age.) What is it to non-Texans?"

ITS DEAD!! 
"SB5 dead.. for tonight. Well see what happens from here on out, but the bill will not pass in the current/ended special session."

"SB5 is dead for now, but I have a feeling the life will be breathed back into it very soon. Good night, everyone."
This was amazing. I am so happy that this could have happened. This is democracy. This is what the people wanted.

Wendy Davis addressing the crowd in the rotunda now.
"*Update at 2:57 a.m. by Claire Cardona Here are a very upset Dewhurst?s full remarks to the chamber and press: ?Members, the constitutional time for the first called session for the 83rd Legislature has expired. Senate Bill 5 cannot be signed in the presence of the Senate at this time and therefore cannot be enrolled. It?s been fun, but, uh, see you soon. ?I know it?s late and I?m sorry but I?ve got a couple of sentence I want to say and that?s really all I want to say for this evening. This is the mot incredible thing I?ve ever seen in my life. An unruly mob using Occupy Wall Street tactics has tried all day to derail legislation that has been intended to protect the lives and the safety of women and babies. SB 5 passed 19-10 but with all the ruckus and noise going on I couldn?t adjourn sine die pending completion of administrative duties. And right now I cannot sign the ? bill. So I?m very frustrated. ?I didn?t lose control over what we were doing, we had an unruly mob of hundreds if not a thousand people in here who were screaming and yelling and we couldn?t communicate with our members.?* David Dewhursts name and face needs to be placed at the forefront of this story. It will be a nice contrast to Wendy Davis."
"Wendy, please come to Australia and teach our politicians to be inspiring like you. "
The bill is dead. 
"According to NPR the Repubs conceded that the final vote was after midnight, so the bill didnt pass! http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/06/26/195723770/texas-lawmakers-11-hour-filibuster-ended-on-a-technicality?sc=17&amp;f= Edit:added link"
Thank you Wendy for standing between us and the stone age! The state of our world is so completely ridiculous.
How many pro-lifers have adopted an unwanted baby? 
"So Perry was quoted as saying, In Texas, we value all life ...this on the eve of the states 500th execution. "
"As a liberal and a Democrat, I am horrified to wake up (7:45 EST) and see this story next to last on reddit politics while the umpteenth generic story about what the cost of war could fund, blah blah blah...is number one. *Horrified.* "
"?An unruly mob, using Occupy Wall Street tactics, disrupted the Senate from protecting unborn babies,? he said. Sorry but isnt it the mothers job to protect her unborn baby? Isnt there something to be said for allowing people to make decisions for themselves and face the consequences of them for themselves? If more women were held to account and were educated and supported in their decisions, these points would be moot, women would only have abortions out of great need and when they feel like they cant protect their born baby. Instead we create a society where we disempower women, make choices for them, limit their options and then expect them to act like they live in fantasy fairy land where all children are precious to their communities and have all the resources they need to live perfect lives. AND then we shun them and punish them when it all doesnt magically work out !? I AM SICK OF THIS RUBBISH! YOU CANT FORCE PEOPLE TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION. EVEN GOD GAVE US FREE WILL. Who the hell are these MEN to take it away, judge and decide what a woman can and cant do!?!?!?!?!?!?!"
"Folks, with all the excitement here, remember. There is overwhelming support for the bill and others like it, in Texas. Maybe not 19-10 statewide, but definitely over 50%. It lost this time because the Republicans screwed up. I dont know the details, but they could have gotten it passed if they had their sh*t together, like they did with the [sonogram law] (http://prospect.org/article/where-was-outrage-over-texass-sonogram-law). This time, they had to lie to stop the filibuster, then time ran out on them. It led to real drama, and people talking about it, which is good. But given the current political climate, they will try again, and they wont make all those mistakes next time. UPDATE: I spoke too soon. Some [polls appear to show](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/jun/27/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-majority-texans-support-faile/) that most Texans are not in favor of more abortion restrictions. "
Why are politicians like Rick Perry in office?
Because many voters can neither spell nor define infrastructure. They often dont understand marginal and effective tax rates so they dont or would not want to move into the next tax bracket and lose money. There are voters who do not know what LIBOR is and why rigging it would be a scandal/problem.
"Infrastructure improvements are almost a freebie. That work would require vastly increasing employment (to actually do that work) and by moving that many workers from public assistance to becoming tax payers, and the increases in employment to support them as valuable consumers. The only drawback is the reason this does not happen. By decreasing the numbers of people fighting for limited jobs you force down the price of labor, and this is why shortsighted corporations fight against these programs. Why we continue to vote for those who work against improving our nations services, I have no idea."
"Interesting, I fall within those numbers and have always paid taxes, roughly 20%. "
"&gt; and by moving that many workers from public assistance to becoming tax payers Just like many spending programs, this is nice in theory. The only problem is that the middle class doesnt really pay taxes anymore. Sure, they pay into Medicare and Social Security, but thats just about it. In 2010, a family of four earning $50,000 per year paid $-37 in income taxes. And yes, thats a negative sign. [[source]](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/09/obamas-teacher-tax-whopper/)"
"Except that article assumes 4.7 million cancellation notices means 4.7 million lost insurance which is idiotic. Most of the cancellation notices include automatic roll-over into a new plan, plus the *AP article that they cite* detailed that some states decided to allow insurers to continue non-grandfathered plans after the notices were sent, invalidating a lot of them. Ill take conjecture over completely invalid logic anyday."
"As I have said here before: If its time to renew my car insurance and my insurer says, In your new policy, we no longer cover 100% of hail damage, but we are going to start covering the first 25 miles of towing. No one in their right mind would say I LOST my car insurance. Its a disingenuous twist for the lazy press to follow the GOP talking points and say people are losing their insurance. [As POLITIFACT noted:](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-under-his-health-care-law-those-/) BEFORE the ACA, in a government study of one average year; over 14% of people lost their insurance plan, and a whopping 1/3 (around 15 MILLION people) lost their plans due to changes made by their employers."
"1) he didnt do what you are saying he did. It was *because of* not *in spite of* available intel. 2) even if he had, what a nothing of a thing to light your hair on fire over."
"No, it was in spite of: http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/benghazi-timeline/ You have fucking clue what youre talking about. "

"That article says it is against the law, and completely up the prosecutor. It also doesnt address the issue of gay married people being allowed to transfer a gun to their spouse, because it cant happen, because the feds dont recognize gay marriage."
"&gt;What is wrong with verifying that a person that wants a handgun can show they are responsible with it and if not then that privilege is taken away? Absolutely nothing, but thats not what these laws do. These laws, specifically the recent background check laws, do nothing to address any of the issues and concerns. They criminalize law abiding citizens for extremely stupid reasons. These are the situations that would now be felony if these laws passed. 1. If you rent, have a roommate, leave for more than 3 days, with your guns at home, both you and your roommate have committed a felony. 2. If you want to leave your fiance a gun, even if she is licensed to carry her one, that would be a felony. 3. Gay couples, married or not, under federal law would not be granted the same status as a hetero couple, therefore discriminating against them, and making them felons. 4. Letting someone else shoot your gun, felon. 5. Giving your brother/sister a gun, felony. 6. Transfers between step parent/step child, felony. This is even in the case of everyone being legally able to own a gun. And, couple that to the fact that there is no registry, completely unenforceable, and up to severe law enforcement interpretation. &gt;The voter ID laws coming from the ~~Republican~~ *Democratic* side of the aisle are working to put obstacles into the process for *law biding* people that would ~~have voted for the wrong party.~~ *buy/own a gun.* FTFY. Not to get into a fight about parties, and their ideologies, but these types of laws are the same, severe restrictions on our rights, because of a party agenda."

The problem with your statement is that if you graduated from high school and make middle income or above you are more likely to vote (R). If you didnt graduate high school youre more likely to vote (D). I find it amusing that you always hear that its only rednecks voting for Republicans.
"I find it amusing that you got that [completely backwards](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/nov/05/larry-sabato/education-level-tied-voting-tendencies/). FTA: the higher the education level, the more likely [voters] are to vote Democratic. And actually, [Democrats hold a slight majority over Republicans when it comes to being middle class.] (http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/09/26/161841771/how-income-divides-democrats-republicans-and-independents) Unsurprisingly, the wealthy tend to be more Republican. It turns out that its easier to be rich if you come from rich families, who have traditionally voted (R)."
Sure Without high school diploma 64% Obama 35% Romney. 63% Obama 35% McCain http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/2012-exit-polls/table.html Those making between 50-100k 46% Obama 52% Romney.

Youre comparing the two lowest educated groups of people here. A lot of stupid rednecks graduated high school. At this point an idiot can graduate highschool. Its an easy test of your very basic hoop-jumping abilities. 
Did you actually read what I wrote? If you didnt graduate high school youre more likely to vote (D) Is this true or not?
proof of those statements?
"Exactly. Ive had that exact same conversation with my aunt. She retired a few years ago after nearly *forty years* as a nurse in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Naysayers *never* understand the core differences between preventative care and reactionary care, or what they mean for costs in the long run. The fun part of this is that Insurance companies look down on preventative care because its a cost *now*, otherwise they would encourage people on their plans to get checked up regularly by simply waving co-pays for routine checkups. Its pretty obvious why our healthcare system is the way it is when you understand that insurance maximizes its profits by convincing you to skip preventative checkups now, only to cut your benefits later when you need them. Dont pay now, and dont pay later. Its how insurance companies maximize their profits."
"Pre-fucking-cisely. How many people do you know who put off going to the doctor until something gets really bad? Now think of all the people *poorer* than your friends and family; think theyre getting preventative care? Americas culture is a combination of toughing it out and avoid getting care because it costs too much, and its killing us."
"It?s probably true that people are avoiding preventative care to some degree, but it?s not necessarliy the case that all preventative care lowers health costs. It depends on the cost of providing the preventative care relative to the likelihood and severity of the illness it aims to prevent. See http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money/"

I guess it depends on which [source](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/) you trust.
"He refuses to do town halls, and will only do closed door invatation only fundraising events. He does not speak for majority of his constituents. "
"Well, a couple things. &gt;A) anyone who already agrees with him, and B) anyone who will defect from the opposition to support him and people who already agree with him. This is true, but isnt this every politician? The way I took it was he was saying I dont care if theyre democrat or republican, if they share any of my views im willing to work with them. &gt;is supposed to convey some idea that hes willing to compromise. He has been willing to compromise. Cruz hates obamacare, he always has, yet he was willing to compromise to the point of just delaying the mandate 1 year. The government would have never been shutdown if this compromise was met by the senate, it wasnt so it shut down. Then now after the shutdown Obama decides to delay the mandate anyway... If you are a committed liberal you probably hate Cruz, reasonably so. But I guess I just dont understand why he is being portrayed as a liar. "
[It might be more accurate to ask what he doesnt lie about.](http://www.thenation.com/blog/176711/nothing-ted-cruz-said-about-aca-today-true) Of much greater concern are [the people he represents.](http://jonathanturley.org/2013/10/12/ted-cruz-dominionism-and-jesus/)
"What exactly did Cruz lie about? He obviously hates obamacare, he has done everything in his power to stop it, he still doesnt like it. Hes still doing everything he can to try and end it. What is he lying about exactly?"
"Perhaps the part where he implied he didnt want to shut down the government, and wanted to work with everyone. Yeah, that part. Its as if the people who will run out to defend Cruz are just as inherently dishonest as their hero. Hmm."

Sadly this isnt unique to Florida. The rejection of Medicaid expansion happened 19 other states. All with Republican governors. This is from the ALEC playbook they all use. Its sad how bought our state governments are. For those who dont know about ALEC: [This is ALEC](http://www.alecexposed.org/wiki/What_is_ALEC%3F) Edit: Added link for info on ALEC. 
Rick Scott is fucking horrible. He is without a doubt one of the biggest scumbags in politics
the act of denying people health care makes *you* the death panel.
"If they dont come up with a plan, Democrats take the blame because You said Obamacare would solve these problems! instead of actually looking to what happened. Its a win-win for Republicans. Unfortunately, its just lose for ordinary people. "
Scotts just protecting Florida from the ACA over Floridians dead bodies.
"Im one of those 750,000. I work as an adjunct professor at a community college. I earn only $505/month when I actually get paid. I do not get paid in the months of May, September, or January. (That assumes that I teach Fall, Spring, AND Summer.) The college claims that I only work 4 hours a week. I work many more than that. I earn too little to get any subsidies from the ACA. And the states rules make it impossible for me to get any benefits whatsoever. (Ive been told multiple times that I would never, ever qualify for Medicaid or Section 8 (the lack of income 3 disparate months out of the year is part of the reason), and I would have to have an employer claim I work 20 hours a week minimum to get the minimum SNAP assistance. I am soon to be homeless--the class B trailer with no electricity or plumbing is scheduled to be towed off the RV lot because it got purchased by someone who is going to raze the park and build high-dollar condominiums instead. The lack of housing will likely mean that I will not be able to teach anymore, as I doubt a shelter will let me stay with even the partial income I have, and I will likely get arrested as I try to ultralight camp in the Big Pine Key Key Deer reserve to survive. This summer will likely be the last term I ever teach, if I can make it that far. No one else wants to hire me. Once Im homeless, getting a job will be nearly impossible: even with a place, no one has wanted to hire me because of conflicts with my teaching schedule OR they claim that my education disqualifies me OR they tell me that I misrepresented myself on the application if I dont mention my education, and they wont hire a liar for the job. Ive thrown in the towel. I will probably die from something preventable in my late 40s to mid-50s (Im 45 now), if I dont take matters into my own hands before then. Im doing everything I can to keep myself above water, but it seems futile. People dont want to hire me because of my depression, yet no one is willing to treat it unless I have lots of money. (When I finally found a treatment that seemed to work back in the days when I was teaching 75 piano students weekly and have the back taxes to prove it, the treatment cost over $600/month counting dr visit and medications. Ive been unmedicated now for over 2 years and am down to just 6 piano students spread out between Ft. Lauderdale and Key West.) No one is willing to risk taking a chance on me anymore, and I dont feel like I have the strength or confidence to try again. No matter what my successes were in the past, I am now a failure to my family, my school, and myself. Your only worth in this world is what you can provide to it, and the world has shown that it doesnt want what I can offer. I cant pay for the possibility of other opportunities (getting temporary certification to teach K-12 in Florida will cost me almost $500 that I dont have, so I cant even apply for band director or choral director jobs). I cant afford to move. I cant afford to stay. So be it."
Seeing Rick Scotts profile: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott ... its no wonder Floridians are getting screwed. This guy has serious ties to medical companies throughout the state who would lose out if federal funding was provided. The US medical system is a total clusterf*ck with states looking out for big corporation needs over the average citizen.
"Wasnt it abundantly clear that they were lying at the time? Just like with all the Well replace Obamacare with something better, but we need to repeal it first lies that are so transparent."
"Rick Scott is just a literal, verifiable piece of shit. A curse on his entire family. They should all become *POOR*, then become *SICK*. *All of them.*"
Its common knowledge in Florida that Rick Scott is human garbage
"What people need to understand is this cold, hard truth: the republican health care plan for the poor and middle classes is this: DIE QUICKLY."
"Rick Scott makes me as a Floridian long for the days of Jeb Bush as Governor. Sure Bush was a Carpet Bagging, Privatizing, Educational Ruining, piece of crap, but even he was smart enough not to turn down free money to help poor people. Voldemort, as I will call him until I have no need to think of this subhuman anymore, is a wanton thief who abuses his power for personal gain. He is only for small government for those who are rich enough to donate to him or hire a lobbyist. If you are poor, well you need big papa government to make sure that you are not smoking weed. You need big government to make sure that you dont challenge established companies in things like beer production. Just an utter and total scumbag. I hope he loses this election, loses all his money, and is forced to live life as a citizen of the real America, not the America that exists only in the fantasy land that is the far right, bootstrapped utopia. "
"Last year, while on medicaid I started an operation for reconstructive surgery from a mastectomy. About a month later, I was ready to have the expander out and finish the operation. Guess what..my Medicaid stopped before I could have this done. Now,I have this foreign object in my chest causing a lot of problems. On top of this I only have 1/2 a lung on the same side(cancer also). Not only did they stop this, but my screening for cancer and treatment for COPD. No dr. and no meds. How I hate Florida!!! Damn monster skeeters too."
"&gt;In short, your state leaders lied when they told you they would come up with an alternative to Medicaid expansion. They didnt lie if pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps or borrowing 40k from your parents retirement account are considered alternatives. People should really spend 1 minute trying to understand the conservative-think. In their minds all this shit is 100% above board, rational, honest, good, etc. There is nothing sneaky about it. The only sneaky thing, from a conservative and libertarian viewpoint, is poor people getting medical care they didnt pay for. I loathe conservatives and libertarians. But I am not stupid. I understand them. I dont play games. I know what their positions are. We are being too gracious and too polite when we call what the conservative politicians are doing sneaky or lies or whatever. Its neither lies nor sneaky. Its all done in the open and with an understanding shared by much of their base."
"Why would the FL governor want to reduce emergency room costs or hospital costs?? Rick Scott is a billionaire from FOR PROFIT hospitals, the same ones which hold the record for the largest fine in US history for defrauding medicaid/medicare, the same ones who he quickly transferred responsibility for off to his wife so he could be governor. He and his cronies have no reason to keep costs down, if anything its the opposite, and they sure as shit dont care about uninsured poor people. Source: pissed off native Floridian."
"This is exactly what would happen at a national scale if they somehow managed (or manage in the future) to dismantle the ACA. Oh sure, well replace it with something else, trust us! In the meantime, repeal! &lt;later&gt; Oh, yeah well put something back in place for that, soon, trust us. &lt;later&gt; I dont know what youre talking about, the current system is perfect."
"Lets reject the federal money and create our own system that we have to pay for entirely with state funds! Indiana seems to be doing the same thing. I have no idea how the state is going to afford it. What really makes it bad is that these states could have created a state based exchange or other state based solutions. They rejected a state based solution for the actual insurance and opted to use the federal website. But then when it comes to medicaid which the feds would be paying for, now they MUST have a state solution. It makes no sense."
"And so, the phrase compassionate conservative takes it rightful place, alongside jumbo shrimp and military intelligence."
"nice to see that 7 other republican states have done just what they said they would do, create alternatives.."
"I know, it infuriates me that they blatantly advertise lies about healthcare and it comes down to who has more money to blast ads. I remember when the ACA was being implemented and i spent hours educating friends about what it really meant since everyone was so misinformed. "
"Is there even one republican on here that can give a serious, thoughtful explanation of why this is the right thing to do? Im seriously curious."
"Remember everyone, both parties are exactly the same. /s"
"Maybe the state legislature doesnt trust Governor Scott with access to Medicaid funds because, you know, his past problem with fraud and Medicaid. http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/mar/03/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-rick-scott-oversaw-largest-medicare-fra/ Ah, we know the reason, Gang of PLutocrats playing election games with peoples lives."
Rick Scott is one of the worst things that has ever happened to Florida.

I will never understand why it is so bad to have health insurance. In what way does this prevent freedom? Does car insurance prevent freedom? That shit is required. 
"Here in Michigan, our Republican governor (who is apparently a little more pragmatic than most) aggressively fought to pass the Medicaid expansion when our Republican legislature initially opposed it. The funny thing is, if we had a Democratic governor, it probably wouldnt have passed, because the Republicans would have taken a hard line."
"&gt;...memorials for a war that ended 150 years ago Author must not be from the South if he thinks that. Well, maybe. The war ended, but that doesnt mean they arent using the *cornerstone* principles of the confederacy as a guiding light down here."

"If Satan and Amy from Amys baking company had a child, that child would have better moral fiber than Rick Scott."

"Wow. That article was direct, clear, and damned brutal. Not as brutal as denying 3/4ths of a million Floridians basic health care out of idiot political spite and general contempt for the poor. But, still, brutal. *corrected for grammar and increased sense of outrage*"
"Perfect. You cant have expanded coverage from ACA and Medicaid, but you can instead have the big ball of nothing except lip service well give you. Good luck with those cancer treatments! Pray the pain away, maybe."
Ha!
I dont see the problem personally. The governor made the decision not to extend ~~medicare~~**MEDICAID**. If you want socialism go move to north korea edit: fixed for all you nitpicky liberals. Seriously you knew what the fuck i meant 
Thanks republicans!
"**Dont people realize that the GATS (NAFTA, CAFTA, TPP, etc) agreements (GATS is WTO) bans any post-signing expansion of public services**. So, no matter what- they have to stay below 50% of the medicaid eligibles getting in and below 50 states getting in. They only expanded medicaid to 40% of the eligibles and 40% of the states. **That way they can still claim to be phasing it out and that full privatization is the future.** Thats it. FTAs trump national and state laws. Sorry!"
Is it just me or does every newspaper headline these days read like opposition research on GOP politicians? So what the fuck is wrong with ball-less democrats that they cant take advantage of this stuff? 
"Is it me, or do a lot of these comments sound like they come from GOP quick response units?"
"It would be really great if we could discuss this issue without deliberately creating straw men. ACA is not about health *care*. The expansion that was turned down isnt about health *care*. Theyre about money. Health care remains *available* to those 750,000 Floridians, its a matter of who is paying for it. Now, if we want to have a discussion about whether its affordable, or who should subsidize it if its not, thats fine. But can we please stop making this issue something other than what it is - redistribution of wealth. Edit: I think insurance is fundamentally the wrong approach to health care, and would support a single-payer or similar solution. In the meantime, all ACA does is shift the burden of cost for insurance from one party to another. It does nothing to improce healthcare, it just redistributes the cost. For every dollar someone saves, someone else is going to be paying more (whether through taxes, or higher premiums on non-subsidized policies)."
"Thanks, Obamacare."
"Yeah, but was I lied to by people I will vote for regardless of how egregious their actions? If that is the case then it doesnt matter because I am a Steelers...er...um...Republicans fan til I die because my pappy was one too."
Why cant they just go to HealthCare.gov and get affordable health insurance that way?
"Nice, so busy buying into bullshit ideology that they forget to do their job, yet, they will keep it."
"Clearly the solution to this is to elect *more* Bible-thumping science-denying Republicans, right, American South? "
The internet has ruined me. I just cant see sneaky in a title any more and take it seriously.

Im sure someone else has said this already... You get what you vote for.
"I had a girl break up with me because I wouldnt move to Florida with her. She moved and hates life. According to facebook she got knocked up by a meth addict and is having problems getting insured. Every once in a while I send her a story or article about how shitty Florida is. Im going to send her this link. But, Im not bitter and Im totally over it."
How about you get a job and pay for your own insurance. K?
"Michigan dragged their feet, but we got it done in the end (started Apr instead of Jan). Its working surprisingly well, or maybe not that surprisingly, considering its just a change in eligibility requirements for an already established system. My wife works as a sort of liaison between at need students in community college and govt benefits agencies and shes signed up several dozen people in the last few weeks and just about all of them ended up getting the card in the mail just a few days later."
"29 yr old Male, no dependents. Im paying around 70 bucks a month for my health insurance through my company. Free eye exam, plus additional free $250 to a Healthcare savings account that I contribute to, to spend on anything dealing with my health care. 20% copay up to $2500/year. Once I hit that $2500 in my bills at any point during the year, company will take care of anything, thereafter. Also gave me $30,000 life insurance policy free of charge, but I opted to pay $5/month for $150,000 policy. "
Now Im curious about this discussion/debate the legislators had regarding pop tarts...
"Awesome, were now falling behind ARKANSAS."
"It would be good if someone could come up with a per unit (a person insured) number for how many are going to die due to lack of coverage. I.e., if 10,000 people go uninsured, over a five year period, say, you can say dependably that X people will die due to lack of coverage and calculate that based on different stories with different affected populations."
http://oi61.tinypic.com/fwkrww.jpg Its funny when Republicans call Democrats socialists for trying to help the less fortunate through social programs. I think its called being a human being. 
Does anyone think they ever really intended to come up to an alternative? Of course not. All of this alternative talk is just a dog whistle for shitcan welfare.
"This is a both sides thing, right? That is what normally gets used as a marginalization to avoid people taking responsibility for these things...."
Politicians are a problem.
"The only promises Republicans ever keep are to their wealthy corporate donors. If youre not one of those, it is completely illogical for you to vote for a Republican candidate."
USA! USA!
"Good article, but its the same exact lie that Republicans have been telling everyone for 30+ years. We dont like the current ideas to reform health care, but we have our own alternative ideas that we want to try. Then nothing happens. When the issue comes up again they just use the same lie again. The ACA isnt even close to perfect, and I think we all agree there may need to be changes, but at least someone in Washington actually tried putting one of these ideas into action. Thats how you solve problems. "
"I could see the economic reasoning for this, and the political. Florida has a larger population of older citizens than other states, and these older citizens will utilize their health care far more than the young. If the healthy youth in an insurance pool are charged to pay for the care of the less healthy elderly, then one must assume the insurance costs to the young are higher in Florida. What we are probably seeing is class/ageist warfare between the old need the care or will die, and the young who need the money in order to live the kind of life that their predecessors had. In a society that refuses to acknowledge homeless in the streets for a couple of cents, this is not far of a stretch. Republicans have their own intentions, but you dont see young people flooding to the streets begging to pay more in taxes to take care of grandma and grandpa"
I wonder will do all the low paying jobs when all the poor people move out?
What do you expect? The GOP acts in the interests of its few thousand uber-wealthy patrons and acts against the rest of America. Extending medical care to people who are not very wealthy is not a priority of the GOP when there are valuable land grabs and tax cuts to provide to the rich instead.
"Its really hard for me to feel sorry for such a large population who time and time again vote against their own interest. The elderly casts their vote the way they did, now they need to deal with realities of their choices. "
"This article is a bold faced lie. The Obama admin has been completely against other options. Look at HealthyPA by Corbett that the HHS stonewalls. The Obama admin is a bunch of crooks. They say one thing and do the opposite. They merely put forward populist platitudes, they are only concerned with buying votes for democrats."
"Some may call me a cynic, but that entire article was nothing more than par-for-the-course. Where was the actual sneaky lie? Edit: thats what I thought. All downvote, no substance. "
I hate living in Florida. 
"I guess this is a sneaky lie, but no one actually BELIEVED them right? Like SERIOUSLY believed them? They (as in Republicans) have been revamping Health Care in the US for decades now. Doing a good job too. Sure, you say, they havent passed a single bill! But theyve told us theyre doing it, and much better than those awful Democrats. Thats how you know theyre doing a great job. Looks like the great elected officials in Florida are just continuing doing the Good Work. "
"&gt; during the **three years** the federal government was footing the entire bill the federal government are people, working people, taxpayers Yea, THATs the trick...THATs the sneaky lie Obamacare covers new higher benefits **THEN SUDDENLY** after 3 years, **Florida taxpayers** are stuck ...**FOREVER** fuck that shit BTW Reddit, taxpayers are people who go to work and earn wages confiscated as taxes for Libtard projects/promises ...lies, in this case"

"If someone dies as a result of health coverage, they should charge the senators with negligent homicide."
"Called Obama care! No one asked for it, very few are better off now but everyones cost have gone up. Thanks Obama! Edit for sentence completeness "
Fuck Rick Scott and his Republican cronies. 
lucky for them that most americans are willing to take it up the butt. other countries might have actually done something
What happens after the feds stop footing the bill for expanded medicaid? My guess: Fire teachers to come up with the funds to pay for it. Thatll be popular. Or...raise taxes on the same people who already have pay the new ACA tax. Or...more debt (now that I think of it...this is the most likely).
"The GOP has controlled all three branches of Floridas government for 18 years now. At this point, Id vote for a fucking communist just to wrest control from these useless pieces of shit. "
"Hi, Canadian here. I do not worry about anything when it comes to my health. I know that I will be taken care of. Thank you Universal healthcare. In all seriousness the United States is a joke. Every single year I read about the same damn thing. One party wanting change while the other is putting it down. Yes, yes I know it is all politics. Well fuck politics when it comes to health. I am so glad I do not have to live in a country where giving birth is a fucking stress. Where every day you pray to whom ever you believe in to keep you safe because you cannot afford to be injured because of a bill. Holy shit this is such a fucking despicable country. Share the fucking wealth. Your neighbour will one day save you. Whatever rant done."
"So basically that made the conscious decision, as a state, to re-instate natural selection and survival of the fittest. Georgia made the same decision by refusing to allocate funds for development of trauma centers. Basically, the weak, poor, sick, and stupid better get out of those states if they want to continue being taken care if unconditionally. Not to mention that a significant number of Floridas uninsured happen to be illegal immigrants. Seems like they knew exactly what they were doing and theyre happy with that conscious decision."
Know whats great about hearing news like this? Nothing will change to help the system improve. Realities of living in an oligarch can be so fun.
"The real kick in the teeth for Florida is that the federal government quit subsiding the uninsured, because that was going to be covered by expanded medicaid. So not only did Florida decline the federal money to support the expansion they also lost money that went straight to the states hospitals to cover the uninsured/underinsured."
I live in Florida. And I know plenty of poor people that got insured for the first time ever through healthcare.gov Now I know this is my personal Anecdote but who cant get healthcare here in my state and why? 
None of this matters. Republicans are against gay marriage and abortion. All these morons that lost their health care coverage wont give a shit about their healthcare as long they keep voting on those 2 hot ticket issues.
"Governor Brewer and our state legislature did one thing right. They didnt let Arizonans suffer without health insurance. And they very easily could have not passed the expansion as well as lie about why they werent going to pass it. This state is awful politically, but at least it aint Florida."
Florida politicians also fired many state workers as they were battling with Texas to see who could stick it to Obama more. Source: I used to live in that sorry state. The good ole boy system really needs to be torn down in the south. 
"Yeah, lets talk about people **LYING** about the Affordable Care Act?! I mean **WHO** would be so devious?!"
"Ahh Tampa Bay the city of liberals, not saying thats a bad thing its just rare in FL where all the cities are overrun by conservatives spouting anti Cuban or democrat rhetoric. Its weird thinking that a state thats almost equal in minority population sees republicans win every major election. Why is that? Well, because the republicans have continued to vote sanctioning Cuba and the Cuban Americans want Cuba to fall so they can return to Cuba and get the hell out of FL with all the crazy mother fucking conservatives there."
"People dont seem to understand that theres an ultra-utilitarian, almost Machiavellian method at work in these situations. The long game is hoping that the poor die off instead of taking up state resources. "
"Dont feel lonely, Florida! Virginia is on the same path! Course, we still have some hope. We may have elected Republicans to run the General Assembly, but we got a Democratic L.Gov to break tie-breakers in the Senate and a Democratic Governor. So.....maybe we can break the trend."
Floridians hate this one sneaky trick!
Cant one sue??
What do you expect from Republicans?
"Thats not leadership? Since when do leadership and Republican belong in the same paragraph, let alone the same sentence."
"Sigh.. Lets go over this again... Conservatives have no ideas. They are wrong about everything. Everything they do is the wrong thing to do. And every proper and decent thing that should be done, they are against. If everybody would just come to that realization, we can stop with the outrage, stop with the oh look what they did garbage, and start getting rid of these useless pieces of shit."
"Textbook move to refuse/destroy legislation. Diminish current status quot, promise over-reaching solution, debate, table, and forget. If ever brought back up, deflect and blame. Rinse and repeat with anything and everything you want to disappear, just as long as your bullhorn is loud enough. "
"&gt;If were going to say no to Medicaid expansion, lets say yes to something, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, said more than a year ago. My username is finally relevant!"
Another sneaky lie in Florida? Hmm you dont say...... Does Florida even have laws? 
VILE. they should be forced to care for for one day to those who die because of their negligence. 
Times like this is when I wish somebody would hire an assassin to take out all these despicable human beings. 
Insurance agents hate him!
"My brother lives in Florida, in a popup. He has chronic leukemia and mental problems. He was hoping to get health care coverage since the trailer park where he works a few hours a week - crippled as well - dropped coverage. The coverage had a ridiculous deductible but he liked having it, just in case. Dunno how these people sleep at night. Im sure they all go to church on Sundays."
Why does the Governor look like Dr. Evil?
"If you like your healthcare, you can keep your healthcare. -Obama"
So...hows the ACA looking now? Seems like some those republican states that opted out would rather criticize than help their citizens. Good on those for actually coming up with a plan even though the Republican Party still hasnt come up with an Obamacare replacement. 
"&gt; Theyre just hoping that voters arent paying close attention in an election year. ... they havent paid much attention in the last eight years, have they?"
"At this point Im simply happy I was able to get an exemption this year (from the fine) for not being able to get health care. Any health care plan is at least over twice our yearly income, and since I live in FL I would have qualified if they expanded medicaid, but so it goes. Luckily the government was understanding (after two weeks of phone calls) and isnt forcing us to pay the (95?) dollar fee because of this situation (for one year). Life with one family member with cancer, another with brain damage, a third with fibromyalgia and a fourth recovering from pnuemonia with no health care can be rough, but Ill take the wins I can no matter how small. "
This is blatantly all Obamas fault by destroying the private healthcare insurance market. Yet its being spun in a way to appear as Republicans are personally attacking citizens healthcare. So amazing what you can do with the media on your side.
So are the Republican states referenced in the article not on Obamacare or what? How could that be cost effective?
Disregarding peoples well being over prolonged periods of time leads to bad things. Bad things for the government.
Small businesses as is strictly defined by number of emploees are exempt from the aca requirements.
... and politicians are always right.

"21 Senate Democrats is a minority of Senate Democrats. None of the Democrats you listed have been convicted of corruption, unlike, say, the former Republican Majority Whip Tom DeLay. None of them said exactly what Bush was saying about WMDs, either. And there is a pretty clear formulation of the Iraq War by Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bill Kristol, and all their neocon buddies prior to 9/11. Furthermore, since we were specifically talking about AL GORE, it should be noted that he was opposed to it in 2002 http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/gore/gore092302sp.html"
"For what its worth, [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/) has Obama at 22% promises broken. Not bad."
"From your link quoting Al Gores prepared statements: &gt;Nevertheless, Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraq?s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power. Moreover, no international law can prevent the United States from taking actions to protect its vital interests. &gt; We also need to look at the relationship between our national goal of regime change in Iraq and our goal of victory in the war against terror. In the case of Iraq, it would be more difficult for the United States to succeed alone, but still possible. By contrast, the war against terror manifestly requires broad and continuous international cooperation. Our ability to secure this kind of cooperation can be severely damaged by unilateral action against Iraq. If the Administration has reason to believe otherwise, it ought to share those reasons with the Congress ? since it is asking Congress to endorse action that might well impair a more urgent task: continuing to disrupt and destroy the international terror network. Here are some more from the current democratic leadership and others: Pelosi in 98: Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process. Bill Clinton in 98: If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraqs weapons of mass destruction program. John Kerry Oct 02: I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force -- if necessary -- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security. Hillary in Oct 02: In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. "
"&gt;Im sorry honeybunch sugarplum. Maybe you dont remember how the Bush administration went before congresses and lied but I do. There were the 21 Senate Democrats - along with one Republican and one Independent - who voted against the war resolution. And 126 of 207 House Democrats voted against the resolution as well. They got just enough of the corrupt democrats like Kerry, Biden, Clinton, Reid to go along with it though. Not to mention they had months and months to look over intelligence reports and even had access to Bushs intelligence reports. yet they all ended up saying exactly what Bush was saying about WMD. &gt;Funny how you bring up a Republican who demanded and campaigned on the repeal of the ACA. No one lies more than a politician on the campaign trail. He didnt bring up his assault weapons ban during the campaign either. I wonder why? Because he was a severe conservative. lol."
"Democrats have only won the popular vote in the presidential race.......whom we ca tell from Obama that if the Senate and House dont want to cooperate means little. Democrats have a much harder time in the house, senate, and state level."
But only during presidentail elections. Mid term elections democrats fair far worse.
"I thought House Democrat candidates overall received somewhere in the realm of 1.1 million more votes.[Source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/) The Democrats won the popular vote, but gerrymandering was so significant after the 2010 census that it wasnt enough for the Ds to take control of the House. "
and obama calling it an act of terror the day after the attack ?? 
"?No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.? ? Obama, Rose Garden, Sept. 12 he said this. this isnt a lie. "
"When did that happen? If your answer is the Rose Garden speech, dont bother posting it. That has already been debunked by Fact Checker, who gave it Four Pinocchios. http://m.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/obamas-claim-he-called-benghazi-an-act-of-terrorism/2013/05/13/7b65b83e-bc14-11e2-97d4-a479289a31f9_blog.html Even factcheck.org said Obama didnt call it a terror attack. http://m.factcheck.org/2013/05/benghazi-attack-revisited/"
"Ok, Candy."
factcheck.org is a biased source and the other page confirms what I originally claimed. that obama called it an act of terror the day after the attack.
"It is Republicans who enact laws requiring immigrants to carry ID. Republicans who scream of terrorist sneaking over the border to behead our fair blond heads. Republians who ban the study of hispanic history. Most importantly, it is Republicans who block all immigration reform. It is Obama who moved to strike down Arizonas claim to decide citizenship. It is Obama who has championed the Dream act. It is Obama who has ordered extensions to hundreds of thousands of the children of illegal immigrants. The charge that he is not waving his magic president wand is the sad foot stamp! declaration that politics is for daydreamers staring into a mirror and shouting what they would do, if they were relevant. Cant blame them for dreaming. The Obama administration issued a politically charged executive order that will make about 800,000 young people who were brought to the United States illegally as children safe from deportation proceedings, and may make them eligible for work permits. The policy was announced by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. http://www.snopes.com/politics/immigration/dreamact.asp#2U3WXbumSfAQWr0d.99"
"Utter bullshit. While theres something to the sentiment that the responsibility does not lie *solely* with the Obama Administration (indeed, its never that simple), you are giving him far more credit than he deserves for his alleged attempts to introduce a humane approach to immigration. The point is that were looking at about an average of 1,000 deportations *per day*. Those are families torn apart. Children left without caretakers. Fathers and mothers and sons and daughters who just disappear, often without any warning and often under extremely Constitutionally-dubious circumstances. And the fact of the matter is that there is plenty Obama couldve done already - things he could do *today* - to minimize the impact our immigration policies have on millions of people. Stroke of a fucking pen, he could expand his Deferred Action program to include a larger segment of the population. He could put an end to Secure Communities. He could greatly neuter the amount of power thats been afforded to ICE. He could alleviate the suffering and fears of hundreds of thousands of families. Instead, hes opted to throw us breadcrumbs and nothing more. He does not get to escape accountability here."
"As I already said, Im well aware of the breadcrumbs hes tossed us to keep us placated enough. However, he doesnt need a magic president wand to do something about Secure Communities or expand Deferred Action, both of which would have a greater impact than everything else youve cited. 800,000 young people safe from deportation proceedings? Great! But as long as local law enforcement agencies continue to be compelled to cooperate with Immigrations and Customs to round people up off of the streets, many of those children will be separated from their parents. Thats no victory. Again, to characterize any movement in these areas as demanding a wave of his magic wand is incredibly disingenuous, and a sad attempt to once more insulate the president from the burden of responsibility he *shares* in this situation. No, blame does not fall squarely on him. But the tone with which you seem to exalt him with doesnt do anyone any favors."
"&gt; So he should get credit for the good things in the economy (corporate profits) while remaining immune to criticism about the things that suck about the economy? Generally speaking, presidents get too much of the credit and too much of the blame for what happens in the economy. No matter what the circumstances, the president tends to have less control over it than critics or fans will assume. http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/11/presidential-blame-credit/ http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/12/obama-claim-economic-victory-or-not/ http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/25/can-a-president-control-gas-prices-depends-on-when-you-ask/ "
"&gt; So he should get credit for the good things in the economy (corporate profits) while remaining immune to criticism about the things that suck about the economy? No, he should be given credit, good and bad, for things that have changed, esp due to policies hes pushed through, since hes been in office. He should not be held responsible for those things that are more foundational, or that are not within his realistic ability to affect, for a variety of reasons. I think its safe to say the Stimulus Package (whens the last time you even heard that phrase, compared to often we heard about it when it was supposed to be the devils pill?) has had its effects, including lowering the unemployment, etc. House prices have rebounded. And given the situation he inherited, I think hes done a decent job with the budget crisis as well. Corporate profits and worker share of profits are things that are guarded like few other things, and are deeply rooted in the way this country is run, including the media, going back to mccarthyism. Frankly, I think you just dont like Obama, and arent very interested in a neutral analysis, with further educating yourself about our economy and political system. But excuse the ad hominem opinion."
"&gt;Frankly, I think you just dont like Obama, and arent very interested in a neutral analysis, with further educating yourself about our economy and political system. But excuse the ad hominem opinion. Of course I dont like Obama, but its absolutely ridiculous and base that you would assume ignorance is the cause of that. Im not exactly sure what you mean by a neutral analysis, are you triangulating between the parties of today, or are you considering relative cultural, historical, and international norms? And the ad hom isnt just a lazy substitute for an argument (which seems to be one of an impotent executive), its so far off base as to be laughable. My degree is in political economy, and my minor was history. Specifically, I set out to study the rise and fall of empires when I realized I had a great example of an empire in decline outside my door. "
"&gt; and thats not an accident when you stuff your economic team full of bankers &amp; investors. This. A thousand times this. Barack Obama is not a progressive. Hes not a liberal. Hes not a socialist or a Democrat. First and foremost hes a corporatist. He wouldnt have gotten the job otherwise. Dont believe me? Look up Larry Summers, who hes probably gonna nominate to chair the Federal Reserve."
"&gt;nor can it be addressed by a sitting President. So he should get credit for the good things in the economy (corporate profits) while remaining immune to criticism about the things that suck about the economy? Income inequality has *grown* under Obama, and thats not an accident when you stuff your economic team full of bankers &amp; investors. "
Add that to the list of other shit he hasnt kept. Fuck that guy.
