Not requiring ID is a blatant invitation for fraudulent activity like dead people voting and people voting in multiple precincts. Over the past decade Texas has convicted 51 people of voter fraud, according the states Attorney General Greg Abbott. Only four of those cases were for voter impersonation, the only type of voter fraud that voter ID laws prevent. Nationwide that rate of voter impersonation is even lower."

26917166017, Are food stamps effective? -economists say food stamps have a high multiplier i.e. the money is re-spent before it leaks out of the country.
26917473115," Youre assuming $1 dollar is removed from the economy via taxation Your equation would essentially mean that any use of money by the government inherently is chipping away at the economy absent of a 300%+ return in identifiable tax revenue Youre comparing the tax revenue required for funding to the money returned via taxation from spending. Not only is this a fundamental misunderstanding of what an economic multiplier actually is(or is useful for) and how it is applied to food stamp benefits compared to the lost business revenue, but you manage to mislabel the Food and Nutrition Service as some form of bloated beauracratic waste while in reality it is one of the most efficient federal programs in terms of benefits to administrative costs ratio Even if you consider fraudulent gains of benefits, meaning people are receiving a benefit they do should not be eligible to receive, or the even less common selling/trading etc., that money is still positively impacting the economy due to the inherent velocity of the benefits compared to other economic activity."

Wisconsin＊s poverty rate stands well under the national average, so it would be reasonable to assume that the households of Wal-Mart employees in other states would be more likely to qualify for public assistance. On the other hand, Wisconsin＊s Medicaid program eligibility requirements are more inclusive than other states＊, meaning many WalMart employees in other states could find themselves ineligible for Medicaid while their Wisconsin counterparts of equivalent incomes would be eligible.

My god you are hitting all the highnotes on bullshit lies about single payer healthcare. Do you read from a playbook or do you actually believe the shit you are spewing? It＊s certainly the case that we have higher survival rates than the United Kingdom and other countries with nationalized health care. Across the board, the United States boasts a higher five-year relative survival rate than the European average, according to a 2008 study in the British medical journal Lancet. For breast cancer, for instance, the U.S. survival rate was 83.9 percent, the U.K. rate was 69.7, and the average European rate was 73.1. Thus, countries with more advance screening will have higher survival rates even if they don＊t have better post-diagnosis care. "

26781570350," **Summary** A Kerry ad implies Cheney has a financial interest in Halliburton and is profiting from the companys contracts in Iraq. The fact is, Cheney doesnt gain a penny from Halliburtons contracts, and almost certainly wont lose even if Halliburton goes bankrupt. **Stock Options** That still would leave the possibility that Cheney could profit from his Halliburton stock options if the companys stock rises in value. However, Cheney and his wife Lynne have assigned any future profits from their stock options in Halliburton and several other companies to charity. And were not just taking the Cheneys word for this -- we asked for a copy of the legal agreement they signed, which we post here publicly for the first time. The Gift Trust Agreement the Cheneys signed two days before he took office turns over power of attorney to a trust administrator to sell the options at some future time and to give the after-tax profits to three charities. The agreement specifies that 40% will go to the University of Wyoming (Cheneys home state), 40% will go to George Washington Universitys medical faculty to be used for tax-exempt charitable purposes, and 20% will go to Capital Partners for Education, a charity that provides financial aid for low-income students in Washington, DC to attend private and religious schools."

Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive."

Please stop throwing around the lie that Clinton created a surplus. He didnt. It was all an illusion. Democrats controlled the house and senate in 2008 and 2009. Obama took over in 2009. See how the blue deficit bar triples under their fine leadership? And then it dips a tiny bit until 2013, when those evil republicans start demanding Dems run higher deficits that Reps. And I would like them to not say they cut spending when all they do is decrease the amount the budget was set to grow. size does not refer JUST to the number of people employed by the government.

26727448937," Romney was trying to revive a talking point -- that by the end of his first term, Obama will have added as much debt as all the prior 43 presidents combined -- that was accurate enough to earn a Mostly True from PolitiFact. This time, though, he allowed small but significant changes to creep in and weaken its accuracy. Romney confused public debt and gross debt; he failed to clarify that he was talking about the debt accruing during the entirety of Obamas first term; and he misplaced the word almost in a way that makes it hard to parse his claim. If we use the public debt figure and put the word almost where the Romney campaign says it should be, almost might apply to one of three comparisons -- one in which the debt is about four-fifths of the way to equalling totals under previous presidents. Thats a grain of truth, but not much more. We rate the statement Mostly False. Romney campaign ad: President Obama says hes creating jobs, but hes really creating debt. The facts are clear. Obamas four deficits are the four largest in U.S. history. Hes adding almost as much debt as all 43 previous presidents combined. And over 30 cents of every dollar Obama spends is borrowed, much of it from countries like China. Hes not just wasting money. Hes borrowing it, and then wasting it. We cant afford four more years. **The claim that Obamas four deficits are the four largest in U.S. history ignores the fact that Obama inherited most of his first deficit when he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009.** As we have written many times before, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the fiscal year 2009 deficit at $1.2 trillion two weeks before Obama took office. That fiscal year started Oct. 1, 2008. Due to some additional spending under Obama, the deficit increased to $1.4 trillion for fiscal year 2009. At the end of the fiscal year, **the CBO largely blamed the 2009 deficit on the recession, specifically a sharp decline in tax revenues and an increase in spending in response to the economic crisis 〞 first by Bush and later by Obama**. Deficits have remained high under Obama, but have come down from that $1.4 trillion peak. The deficits in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 were both $1.3 trillion. And in an Oct. 5 CBO report that it dubbed ※2012 Deficit: Smaller, But Still Big,§ it estimates the just-concluded 2012 fiscal year ran a deficit of about $1.1 trillion. It would be accurate to say that Obama was president during three of the four largest deficit years in American history, but **he bears only a small measure of responsibility for the largest**. The ad also claims that Obama is ※adding almost as much debt as "

26742824189," Walmart wages are so low that many of its workers rely on food stamps and other government aid programs to fulfill their basic needs Though the study assumes that most workers who qualify for the public assistance programs do take advantage of them According to the report, Walmart had more workers enrolled in the states public health care program in the last quarter of last year than any other employer, with 3,216 people enrolled. When the dependents of those workers were factored in, the number of enrollees came to 9,207. When low wages leave Walmart workers unable to afford the necessities of life, taxpayers pick up the tab, After accounting for the total number of Walmart stores and employees across the state and the per-person costs of BadgerCare, as the states health care program is known, the reports authors estimated that the cost of publicly funded health care comes to $251,706 per year for a 300-employee Supercenter. The authors then added up the projected costs of other public-assistance programs available to families on BadgerCare... Assuming all those workers avail themselves of those additional programs -- granted, an unlikely scenario -- the report extrapolates that the final tab would top $900,000. In response to the report, Walmart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company was proud of the opportunities it provides for employees... noting that 75 percent of Walmart managers started as hourly employees. The report, entitled The Low-Wage Drag on Our Economy, was produced by Democrats with the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is chaired by Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.). The labor policies of Walmart, and those of companies that emulate its low-road approach, end up leaving taxpayers holding the bag, Miller said in a statement. Critics have long denounced Walmart for paying such low wages that many workers are forced to take advantage of public-assistance progra"

Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society. It aimed to reverse the interlocking changes sweeping over the South during Reconstruction: to destroy the Republican partys infrastructure, undermine the Reconstruction state, reestablish control of the black labor force, and restore racial subordination in every aspect of Southern life."

Truth be told, Republicans were so taken with Heritage＊s design that a grand number of two of them ever went so far as to introduce a federal bill based on it and Mitt Romney used it as the basis of reform in deep-blue Massachusetts. Oh, and Newt Gingrich once said something nice about it 〞 in 1995. This, suffice it to say, is hardly a ringing endorsement."

Hes actively campaigning to end Obamacare - its clear. Nice strawman. They were saying that spilled milk can cause environmental damage, and thus we should regulate it as we regulate other liquids that can cause damage when they spill. [But hey, the EPA overturned that rule anyway.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-he-eliminated-epa-rule-treating-/) Another strawman. If they had proof, theyd go after them. Theres no proof that NG is the cause of these symptoms. Because to the intellectually honest, context matters. I was never wrong as I wasnt the one who asserted he supported Ryans budget (that was someone else) - I was adding context to your correction so that it wasnt misleading people into thinking Amash opposes drastic cuts to the budget, beyond that of even Paul Ryan. For example, Youd probably shout from the rooftops that a majority of Americans opposed Obamacare when it passed, and Id chime in with the context being that is only true if you include in the opposition the people who were upset that it didnt go far enough, i.e. single payer. See, that tells a completely different and more accurate story. But it wont stop people like Amash from insisting Americans opposed Obamacare! Isnt that *literally* what he was insisting upon with his opposition to Ryans budget? He knew it wouldnt pass, so he took the free opportunity to go on record as favoring deeper cuts to services and more money to the top 2%. He didnt even need to - Ryans budget was a nonstarter and a political stunt, but he took the opportunity to clarify his position as being *even further to the right* of his party. "
26808095864," I think thats from Jim Bridenstine... As far as MILK goes, you really think Exxon spilling oil all over the place has the same impact if it was milk? Thats what the EPA was doing, it was equating milk to oil. They went after MILK but they wont go after companies that turn peoples drinking water into flammable liquid. So what? He doesnt support Paul Ryans budget. You were wrong. Hes not some hypocrite talking about cutting spending for the poor while wanting to hand out subsidies to the rich"

26793684401," Splain, please. Overall, the data provided by the 26 countries included a total of 2872 deaths among children aged less than 15 years for a period of 1 year. Homicides accounted for 1995 deaths, including 1177 (59%) in boys and 818 (41%) in girls. Of the homicides, 1464 (73%) occurred among U.S. children. The homicide rate for children in the United States was five times higher than that for children in the other 25 countries combined (2.57 per 100,000 compared with 0.51) (Table_1). A firearm was reported to have been involved in the deaths of 1107 children; 957 (86%) of those occurred in the United States. Of all firearm-related deaths, 55% were reported as homicides; 20%, as suicides; 22%, as unintentional; and 3%, as intention undetermined. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S. children aged less than 15 years was nearly 12 times higher than among children in the other 25 countries combined (1.66 compared with 0.14) (Table_1). The firearm-related homicide rate in the United States was nearly 16 times higher than that in all of the other countries combined (0.94 compared with 0.06); the firearm-related suicide rate was nearly 11 times higher (0.32 compared with 0.03); and the unintentional firearm-related death rate was nine times higher (0.36 compared with 0.04).

The bill then passed by a vote of 60每39 on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for, and **all Republicans voting against (except for Jim Bunning, who did not vote).** Several weeks after the vote, on January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Senate in a special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters. ...(snip)... The second effect was more practical: the loss of the Democratic supermajority complicated the legislative strategy of reform proponents.

26942850435," They voted to repeal the ACA 46(?) times before they shut the government down in an attempt to derail it. This is how much they hate the ACA as is. You can also add the fact that the red states didnt set up online state ACA registries like they were supposed to. Which, famously overburdened the federal site. But let me explain why even the lack of votes is still their fault. Democrats that like insurance lobby money may vote the other way if the insurance lobby disapproved of single-payer, and likely yes, they would disapprove. However, votes lost by those Democrats would never be picked up on the Republican side simply because of their irrational lock-step voting. They are not using reason. They are not open to debate. They do not care for their constituents and openly lie to them about the provisions of the ACA. they are the reason America is turning into a fascist third world country."

Except for statistics that actually show 44% of the elderly would be in poverty without social security, and on average SS accounts for two-thirds of income for its elderly beneficiaries. The top 0.1% control HALF of all capital gains. Your fun with numbers is rubbish. Pretending the market and the federal reserves control over inflation is anything but a tax on the poor and a control of wealth is insanity."
26972707229, do not event say that the top 0.1% control half of all capital gains. Obviously the top 0.1% will move capital around in great amounts considering a large number of them. . If that is true then a lot of people did not use their incomes wisely or invested poorly.

It produced the largest overhaul of Medicare in the public health programs 38-year history. &gt; &gt; The MMA was signed by President George W.

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) is a United States Act of Congress that is a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which included Title I, the governments flagship aid program for disadvantaged students.... &gt; **NCLB expanded the federal role** in public education through annual testing, annual academic progress, report cards, teacher qualifications, and funding changes. &gt;The legislation was **proposed by President George W.

Holder last month instructed federal prosecutors to stop charging nonviolent drug offenders with crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences."

The average age of a fast food worker is 29. In order to retire, you must save for retirement throughout your career. People need to always be saving for retirement. It is (literally) exponentially better to start saving for retirement at a younger age. Its also an issue for the people who cant earn a decent living their entire lives.

The effects of grazing on desert tortoises, however, have not been studied in a quanti?tative or scientifically rigorous manner The historical record shows that: &gt;1. Desert tortoises have coexisted with cattle for 300 years in California and Mexico and at least 100 years elsewhere. &gt;2. The highest tortoise densities known occurred at a time when overgrazing by livestock was the severest ever known. &gt;3. The fewer the cattle on a range, the fewer the number of tortoises. Concerns about the impacts of the Ivanpah Solar thermal project led the developers to hire some 100 biologists and spend US$22 million caring for the tortoises on or near the site during construction.[19][20] Despite this, in a 2011 Revised Biological Assessment for the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, the Bureau of Land Management anticipated the loss or significant degradation of 3,520 acres of tortoise habitat and the harm of 57每274 adult tortoises, 608 juveniles, and 236 eggs inside the work area, and 203 adult tortoises and 1,541 juvenile tortoises outside the work area. The BLM expects that most of the juvenile tortoises on the project will be killed.[21][22] A page on the BLM website, since removed, listed the impacts of trespass cattle owned by Cliven Bundy ... Non-governmental organizations regional offsite-mitigation strategies are also delayed for the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone government officials ... entered into a literal, intentional conspiracy to deprive the Hages not only of their permits but also of their vested water rights.

27034455526," Dr. BRENNER: The concerns we have are actually twofold. One is that there are actually a lot of people who go through airport security many times. One group, of course, is airline pilots, another group is frequent fliers. A typical commercial airline pilot in this country goes through security anywhere from 200 to 400 times a year. So that means that the very small risk from an individual scan is multiplied by that number 200 or 300 times for a pilot, or for a frequent flier, in fact. Theres certainly frequent fliers who go through the security that many times in a year. I certainly would. Its hard to know what the logic is. I mean, I think the logic must be that the TSA believes both of them are safe and so theyre using both of these devices. But there is certainly not conclusive evidence but convincing evidence that there will be some cancers induced some time in the future by these X-ray devices. As a ProPublica/PBS NewsHour investigation detailed earlier this month, X-ray body scanners use ionizing radiation, a form of energy that has been shown to damage DNA and cause cancer. "

Just because someone doesnt currently approve of the job hes doing, doesnt mean hes an awful president...I have a pretty clear stick for measuring and he dont make it there yet. History, again, will bare that out. so what if its a bare minimum requirement I am not sure what a good president is, to be honest. he did bring it back from the edge that the republican and a republican president pushed us to with de-regulation, wars paid for on credit cards, a hugely unfunded Medicare Part D implementation thats costs us billions every year. That has a lot to do with it. If you dont believe that, you are simply lying to yourself. they SUPPORTED many of the policies until presented by a democratic president Let me know when Obama hits a 77% disapproval rating OK. However, that was not the case, and he had to work around the current piss-poor republican contingent and that hampered his presidency. "
27052352239," You fail to understand what seemingly every fact checker in America understands. The ACA intentionally makes it near impossible to have a plan grandfathered; the intention was to have these plans cancelled from the beginning. I guess he did anyway to try to compensate for his epic lie (though it looks like at the state level they are refusing to enforce it). Newsflash: most Americans think Obama is an awful president too, even worse than where Bush was at this same point in his presidency. Translation: Republicans presented even worse candidates, so Obamas awful policy choices and mistakes dont make him a bad president. It doesnt make him a good president. Certainly most Americans disagree, and I would think their judgement is more important. This is a bare-minimum expectation, not some sort of profound achievement, though I would largely say that attributing responsibility for economic performance to the president is fallacious most of the time. Is your bar for being a good president really that low? Clearly the majority of Americans who think Obama is a bad president only do so because he is black, as nothing to do with awful performance, and supporting policies that half the country is opposed to. You really cant stop doing it, can you? I have sometimes flirted with doing this, though I suspect for different reasons."

A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations. It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief."

When youre a senator, traditionally whats happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit &amp;mdash; for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we, we cant play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And Im the first one to acknowledge it. "

In September, the Medical Group Management Association -- a trade group for medical-practice executives -- surveyed 1,000 physician groups that collectively employ 47,500 doctors. The survey asked, among other things, Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange? Only 29 percent of respondents gave a definitive yes."

If they were looking to see why the initiatives Obama pushed for failed, perhaps they should take a look at Congress. but instead look seek some attack no matter how poorly grounded in reality."
27096927095," Except we are *here* and *now* with Obama, who has continued *and expanded* a lot of the same bullshit from the last administration. I think what sets him apart from Bush in this respect is that Obama *campaigned* on certain fundamental promises, the majority of which he has broken completely. Since Obama is still president, his history is still being written, and we need to hold him up to closer scrutiny than ever before. Cant we blame both? This article was specifically discussing the failings of the POTUS, *not* Congress. We need to hold them *both* accountable. Im *sick to death* of people blaming Congress to excuse Obama, and vice versa. I know this will be an unpopular opinion here, but I *do* think this article is grounded in reality. Your points would have more validity in the universe where the two party system hasnt been completely corrupted. This is not that universe."

Quoting from the link, All the experts we have talked to were more than eager to acknowledge that Obama has done more to protect whistleblowers than any other president before him. But national security whistleblowers represent a glaring exception. The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than any president before. He didnt like warrantless wiretaps And he still doesnt. The program that youre referring to died in 2007. I think what youre trying to argue is the NSA spying scandal, but thats a different animal."

When the insurance companies started canceling these plans, had they pointed users to the Healthcare.gov site instead of selling them their own trumped up plans, most of these people would have seen they can get real insurance cheaper. The problem here is, instead of calling the president a liar, tell the people the truth of what is really going on. This way we dont end up with misconceptions and posts like this."

26781570350," **Summary** A Kerry ad implies Cheney has a financial interest in Halliburton and is profiting from the companys contracts in Iraq. The fact is, Cheney doesnt gain a penny from Halliburtons contracts, and almost certainly wont lose even if Halliburton goes bankrupt. **Stock Options** That still would leave the possibility that Cheney could profit from his Halliburton stock options if the companys stock rises in value. However, Cheney and his wife Lynne have assigned any future profits from their stock options in Halliburton and several other companies to charity. And were not just taking the Cheneys word for this -- we asked for a copy of the legal agreement they signed, which we post here publicly for the first time. The Gift Trust Agreement the Cheneys signed two days before he took office turns over power of attorney to a trust administrator to sell the options at some future time and to give the after-tax profits to three charities. The agreement specifies that 40% will go to the University of Wyoming (Cheneys home state), 40% will go to George Washington Universitys medical faculty to be used for tax-exempt charitable purposes, and 20% will go to Capital Partners for Education, a charity that provides financial aid for low-income students in Washington, DC to attend private and religious schools."

Shall some trans-Atlantic military giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never. All the armies of Europe and Asia...could not by force take a drink from the Ohio River or make a track on the Blue Ridge in the trial of a thousand years. No, if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men we will live forever or die by suicide. Our safety, our liberty, depends upon preserving the Constitution of the United States as our fathers made it inviolate. The people of the United States are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution. I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. . . corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed. Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one. I agree to this Constitution with all its faults, if they are such: because I think a General Government necessary for us, and there is no Form of Government but what may be a Blessing to the People if well-administred; and I believe farther that this is likely to be well administred for a Course of Years and can only end in Despotism as other Forms have done before it, when the People shall become so corrupted as to need Despotic Government, being incapable of any other. Guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism (the Patriot Act) If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit, which the use can at any time yield. Posterity! You will never know how much it cost the present Generation to preserve your Freedom! I hope you will make good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in Heaven, that I ever took half the Pains to preserve it. Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.

The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty. Cities may be rebuilt, and a People reduced to Poverty, may acquire fresh Property: But a Constitution of Government once changed from Freedom, can never be restored. Liberty once lost is lost forever. When the People once surrendered their share in the Legislature, and their Right of defending the Limitations upon the Government, and of resisting every Encroachment upon them, they can never regain it. Power always thinks it has a great soul and vast views beyond the comprehension of the weak; and that it is doing Gods service when it is violating all his laws. Human passions unbridled by morality and religion...would break the stronges cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government - lest it come to dominate our lives and interests.§ Sect. 17.

However, this ignores the realities of health reform....A key point to remember is that while the Act makes many changes to the individual market, it specifically allows those who want to keep their current insurance to do so. Obama apparently never said you could keep your plan though. Barack Obama says that what hed said was you could keep your plan if it hasn＊t changed since the law passed If you like your plan you can keep it and you don＊t have to change a thing due to the health care law.

In the short run, individuals whose plan changes and is no longer grandfathered will gain access to free preventive services, protections against restricted annual limits, and patient protections such as improved access to emergency rooms."

27119505206," In congressional races in 2010, the candidate who spent the most won 85 percent of the House races and 83 percent of the Senate races, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That＊s a large percentage, but it＊s lower than what the sign indicated. Indeed, the percentage for 2010 was lower than it had been in recent election cycles. The center found that in 2008, the biggest spenders won 93 percent of House races and 86 percent of Senate races. In 2006, the top spenders won 94 percent of House races and 73 percent of Senate races. And in 2004, 98 percent of House seats went to candidates who spent the most, as did 88 percent of Senate seats. So the protester＊s sign would have been essentially correct had it not specifically cited 2010 -- though even then, it would only be true for the House and not for the Senate, which has consistently seen lower percentages of the bigger spenders win. Meanwhile, the success rate of big spenders has been lower at the state level."

I often ask myself if what we pay would be enough, if only there werent so many people funneling it away on ridiculous projects or into their own accounts. Then consider the people driving our lawmakers to enforce or strike down policies (in short, big business), which have repeatedly proven to not have the best interests of our people at heart. The icing on the cake is the part of our country which, because of big business influence, have been convinced that providing any additional government benefits would be detrimental to our societys drive to persevere, cry socialism, or say its wasteful when its really just going to cut into someones exorbitant profits."

Republicans are demanding her resignation because something they dont want isnt going according to plan. Plus it really does suck when a big new rollout falls on its face, even when it gets going later. I feel her pain on that point. Because Republicans have fought tooth and nail to fuck everything up, and now that things are fucked up they are raking Democrats over the coals for letting them fuck things up. Yeah, the rollout has been shit. Shit is getting fixed, but Republican bad faith attacks and sabotage continue. "

"
26915611430," Obama lied when he said you could keep your insurance. The total contract value of this website that only managed to sign up less than 300 people nationwide the first two days was $292 Million They moved ahead with a bad product. They need to get 39,000 people a day on the federal exchange to sign up to meet their 7 million goal by March 1st. The administration still wont release numbers for the federal exchange which doesnt bode well. Meanwhile 90% of the state exchanges have people enrolling in medicaid which is the exact opposite the plan needs to work. Do you honestly think that if the situation was reversed that the Democrats would not revel in the Republicans plan blowing up in their face? Yet, this week millions of people lost their insurance and are facing sticker shock to the new prices. Forbes predicts that 93 million will lose their insurance plans once the employer mandate kicks in. Essential health benefits must include items and services within at least the following 10 categories: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.

27032703133," Both the Senate and President Barack Obama are expected to approve the legislation. This is the first time in history that a Democratic Senate has even proposed cutting the program. Now the upper chamber is expected to pass cuts twice the level it approved last year. But Dems deserve much of the blame, the Democratic aide says. One hundred three Democrats voted against the farm bill, but 89 voted in favor. Democrats in the House and Senate agreed to cut nutrition aid for poor Americans because they have shifted to the right on SNAP politically, the staffer adds. The cuts to the food stamp program come from closing a loophole that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed needed to be addressed. A households level of monthly food stamps benefits is determined by how much disposable income a family has after rent, utilities, and other expenses are deducted. Some states allow beneficiaries to deduct a standard utility charge from their income if they qualify for a federal heating aid program called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, even if they only receive a few dollars per year in heating aid. The arrangement results in about 850,000 households getting a utility deduction that is much larger than their actual utility bill. Because the deduction makes these families disposable income appear to be lower than it actually is, they get more food stamp money each month. The farm bill that passed the House on Wednesday saves $9 billion by closing that loophole."

Of the approved applications, 27 represent unions and another 315 represent plans jointly managed by unions and employers. Even if you took the broadest definition possible, counting all the joint plans as union plans, only 25 percent of the waivers have gone to unions. The rest have gone to plans offered by employers, insurance companies and other non-union groups. To be clear, though, **the waivers do not exempt these groups from the health care law.** They only allow them to continue offering their current health plans with annual limits **until 2014.**"

The 23-cent gender pay gap is simply the difference between the average earnings of all men and women working full-time. It does not account for differences in occupations, positions, education, job tenure, or hours worked per week. **When all these relevant factors are taken into consideration, the wage gap narrows to about five cents.** And no one knows if the five cents is a result of discrimination or some other subtle, hard-to-measure difference between male and female workers."

Its part of a House Republican campaign, led by Boehner, that contends the GOP-controlled House has done its job in trying to strengthen the economy. Westmoreland mailer: & House Republicans have introduced more than 30 bills to help create jobs, grow our economy, and get our country back on the path of success. These bills have all passed the House with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, 27 of these bipartisan bills have hit a brick wall in the Senate, where leadership in the Senate has refused to bring these bills to the floor for an up or down vote. Inflated claims of bipartisanship are not uncommon in Washington. In September, President Barack Obama overstated past bipartisan support for each proposal in his jobs stimulus bill. But  just as with the claims we examine here  parts of the presidents plan received only token Republican support while being opposed by an overwhelming majority of Republicans. Westmorelands mailer provides a link to the complete list of bipartisan legislation blocked by the Senate.§ We used the Library of Congress website to track the votes for each bill. The first bill the GOP lists has been passed by the Senate and signed into law 〞 contradicting Westmoreland＊s ※brick wall§ claim. The bill was the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act (known as the payroll tax cut extension), which Obama signed Feb. 22. The GOP＊s website still lists the bill as ※awaiti"

[...] According to the survey, about three in ten Democrats (31%) and about half as many Republicans (17%) say they or someone in their household has [ever] benefitted from the food stamp program. Self-described political conservatives were no more likely than liberals or moderates to have received food stamps (17% for each group), according to the survey. Blacks are about twice as likely as whites to have used this benefit during their lives (31% vs. 15%). For 2010, Census data show the following for households that reported getting food stamp assistance during the year: 49 percent were white (non-Hispanic); 26 percent were black or African American; and 20 percent were Hispanic (of any race)."

26770398494," State Sen. Wendy Davis was found to have violated three parliamentary rules with less than two hours left in her bid to block passage of a new law At about 10 p.m. (11 p.m. ET), Davis talked about the abortion pill, RU-486, and the chairman ruled that her comments were off topic. Earlier in the evening, a fellow senator helped Davis put on a back brace, which angered some lawmakers who said it violated filibuster rules. That view was upheld in a vote, and she was given a warning. Before that, she had been ruled off topic."
