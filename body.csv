26924613048,They dont get as many juveniles. Thats punishment enough! Leave the corporations alone. This class warfare is ridiculous. They give and give and you entitled brats only take.
26885291769,I wish this was an Onion headline. 
26885243964,"This comment from the comments section of the article sums it up nicely: Republicans have been promising to shut down the government for 3 years. They have refused to conference on the budget for the past 6 months. The Senate agreed to a budget total they didnt like to compromise with Republicans. The votes are there in the House to pass a clean CR but Republicans have blocked the vote. This shutdown has been brought to you by Mr John Boehner, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Senate Conservatives Fund. "
26885211515,"Its simple, really. Create chaos intentionally and then blame it on the other guy. "
26885537217,"I like to consider myself a reasonable and measured participant in our nations politic, but I cannot find any way to describe what the GOP is doing other than directly hostile to the well-being of the country."
26885947079,"Just compare Bachmanns Politifact rating with Obamas, or for that matter, Ted Cruzs http://www.politifact.com/personalities/michele-bachmann/ http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/ http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/ "
26885368683,"Republicans dont like it when you correct them on this. I had this argument today already with a family member. I shut down their bullshit pronto by explaining the situation and dispensing with the fucked in the head talking points. It ended with blub blub blub, I dont want to talk politics.... "
26885569939,They are like abusive parent see what you are making me do?
26885572944,"Vote these people out and get the word out NOT just to the more liberal reddit people, but to the most conservative of the conservatives. The thing with voting is you need EVERYBODY on the same page. Talk to others."
26885226852,"The Republican leadership are not brave enough to own this shutdown. They arent brave enough to compromise with the President on the deficit, to accept even $1 of tax increases for $10 of spending decreases. Instead of governing, they waste their time bravely showing off their conservative credentials through pointless, symbolic resolutions defunding Obamacare."
26885256293,Pretty sure blaming him was also part of the plan.
26885299419,"I think its time to enforce this. Seditious conspiracy (18 U.S.C. ¡ì 2384) is a crime under United States law. It is stated as follows: &gt; If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seditious_conspiracy"
26885219100,"Never mind the fact that Obama didnt vote for a shutdown. They did. And theyll get on TV, and say we voted to fund the government. And no one will ask them: You voted for a bill that you *knew* would not make it through the Senate or off the Presidents desk. You voted for a bill, you *knew* would lead to a shutdown and refuse to vote (or even bring to a vote) for a bill that will actually pass and will actually re-open the government. So how exactly are you not responsible for this shutdown? How exactly is this anyone elses fault but your own? How can you drive the car until the empty-gas light pops on, switch seats, and pretend its anyone elses fault but your own?"
26885220319,"What I cant understand is why they have to blame anyone. According to them, the vast majority of the country wanted a shutdown."
26885271321,The irony... we have been fighting our longest war against extremists abroad only to find them growing strong right here at home. The cancer that is the TeaPartyTaliban is now under our constitutional protection.
26885185365,"Crazy people say crazy shit...again. Tide goes in, tides goes out, you just cant explain that. ;)"
26885280148,"This is not about Republican vs. Democrat at this point. Its about money and personal power. This issue easily goes beyond Obamacare. Think very carefully about this... If Congress can stop the country and default on our debts to overturn ANY existing law, then NO law is really law. The Democrats have no choice but to take it to a default. No choice whatsoever. If they let it go to the brink and then cave, the Tea Party will know they can do it again and again and again. From that point on, any time EITHER PARTY wants to apply supreme pressure they would have the tool available to do so. It is crucially important that this new brinkmanship tool that is being tested... must fail, it has to Edit: Wow Reddit gold, thank you kind stranger!"
26885469527,Its kind of like the Why did you make me hit you? logic of a domestic abuser. 
26885832499,The problem with being pathological liars is that the Tea Party destroyed its credibility with the American people long ago. Theyve alienated everyone in the country.

26885220809,"¡°It¡¯s exactly what we wanted, and we got it,¡± Bachmann said to the Washington Post. So she blames the president, of course."
26885280590,"Yes, the echo chamber is in full swing. Conservative friends on facebook are posting all sorts of rightist Bullshit claiming that it is Obamas fault. "
26885203851,"Using the Presidents name in such a way is meant to evoke a Pavlovian response among their loyal dog pack. Notice its rarely the President or President Obama but simply Obama? Its meant to strip him of the dignity of the office so they can belittle him and look down upon him. Im reminded of a scene in the West Wing where President Bartlets in the Oval Office with his old priest, and the priest asks how to address him -- as Jed or as Mr. President, and he says to call him Mr. President, because he was acting as the office, not as the man. It seems Republicans are too quick to treat President Obama as ol Barry, the cantankerous son of a bitch that no one likes. I wish theyd just start treating him with the respect a President is due."
26885541297,"What I find interesting is that most Republicans -- perhaps realizing that their sides position is flawed as shit -- opt to throw their hands in the air and say, *Both* sides are being ridiculous. They need to figure this out! Anytime you blame both parties, you come across as the neutral and fair person.... even when its clearly one sides fault. Politicians are despised, so the more of them you blame, the more people are like Yea, this person is reasonable."
26885404037,We need to pass resolutions that take the money out of politics so the Koch brothers can stop trying to run the country. The fact that wealth = political power is disturbing. 
26885219074,"That was the plan. Ted Cruz said it back in [July](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/cruz-government-shut-down-no-big-deal-because-it-happens-every-weekend). He also said that the shutdown would be just like the weekends. &gt; Now thats inconvenient, Cruz admitted, before adding but we actually see that every single week on the weekends"
26885181793,And this surprises anyone how?
26885207857,Its Obamas fault for being black!
26885236875,If I were to ever meet bachmen I will kick her face in. The nerve she has to use a verterns horrible memories of a war to make herself and her party look better is heinous. 
26885267703,Because thats how they planned it. Make shutdown happen then blame the other poeple for it. They didnt just plan the shutdown and say well I hope it works out. Gotta have plenty of ammo to try to knock out the ACA when pretty much everyone in the country wants it.
26885276530,"To every single Redditor: its up to us to set the record straight every single time a tea bagger spreads this bullshit. I ask you to fan out and hit up every message board, every web forum, every chat room, every blog, every class room, every talk show, and every news reporter.

26885288550,"Facts dont matter. You just need enough shitty people, to go on TV, with enough gall to confidently spout a lie, over and over again, until it sticks with some people. But since thats kinda long for a tagline, they went with Fair and Balanced."
26885289630,"The teahadists are in a fact-resistant bubble. At this point they seem to have completely lost touch with reality. There is no possible way for the president to back down from this. If he did, it would be like Lincoln allowing the southern states to just break away. We simply cannot allow government by extortion. "
26885296312,of course they do
26885300925,"coming from the bible belt, heavily republican area I can confirm they all truly believe Obama ordered and caused the shut down. Its kinda disturbing. "
26885307729,I really wish Congress would try another track on this. How about they take ALL funds sent to other countries and re appropriate the money to fund a truly free healthcare system for all Americans. There might even be a surplus. 
26885310859,Thats a basic rule of propaganda: accuse the other side of what you yourself are doing.

26885333391,"What a surprise, Republicans making a huge fucking mess and then blaming Democrats. Better call Ripley!"
26885333663,This was their plan all along. They have been doing it for years. Sabatoge the economy and then blame the other side.
26885340367,"Hey, if anybody wants to get together and protest the government shutdown, Im trying to organize some stuff over at http://www.reddit.com/r/DoYourJob/"
26885341826,The sad part of it is that plenty of people are stupid enough to believe it.

26885348027,"I hate the GOPs look what you made me do! attitude. Its an abusive relationship between not only both parties, but also between the people they are paid to lead. Vote them all out."
26885348216,"Insane. Absolutely fucking insane. Republicans are sitting there saying; You wont defund a bill that has already passed both the House and the Senate, that has been signed in to law to provide health care for millions of people? Well, fuck you then, American People. Were going to run this country in to the ground, and youre going to suffer because we want our kickbacks from big pharmacy! This is the issue with a two-party system. Theres no tie breaker. For those saying that the Democrats are at fault here? Sure, they are. As much fault as the other lot of morons? Not even close! It would be different if the Republicans sitting up on the Hill were not essentially using terrorist, hostage tactics to get their way. And thats exactly what this is: Republicans being terroristic and taking the American economy hostage. And you know what? We dont fucking negotiate with terrorists."
26885363809,Obama didnt roll over with his feet in the air! Its all *his* fault!

26885367249,"Seen that on the news this morning, with a clip of John Boner.. The president just needs to call us. He wont talk to us. Really, Boner? What the hell happened last week then?"
26885369634,Fortunately most Americans disagree
26885379369,Why is everyone surprised? The house voted to strike down the ACA 40+ times. Each time the senate voted against the House. Defunding it was planned because it was the last resort of house majority. Literally everyone in politics saw this coming. 
26885380466,This just in: water is wet.
26885382794,Bachmann is fucking retarded.

26885385139,"No politcal party has been a permanant fixture. Federalists, Jeffersonian Replublican, National Republican, Anti-Masonic, Whig, Liberty, Free Soil, The Know-Nothing, and Greenback parties have all become extinct due to becoming obsolete, or representative of minorities that were too small. If the Republican party doesnt begin to represent a larger portion of the people, its quite likely theyll join that list in the not-too-distant future. "
26885387685,"I was watching Boardwalk Empire the other day and there was a scene where Al Capone and his gang goes to a political rally of a candidate they dont like and beat up the voters with bats. At first I thought damn, that probably happened back then and thats brutal. then I thought though it would solve the Tea Party cancer in this country..."

26885393273,"Its called messaging, and the Republicans are brilliant at it."
26885393673,"Before this, the Republicans had a shot at the Senate; now theyll be lucky to keep the House. If a Republican ever takes the White House again, itll be a fluke."

26885397023,"I remember being mad about this kind of stuff in 2000. This is nothing new. This is their strategy, counting on the notion that their followers are too stupid/apathetic to know any better. And it works remarkably well. I will never understand the mindset of someone who cares enough to support a policy/person but not enough to understand what the thing/person they are supporting represents. Theres gotta be a line drawn where ignorance crosses over into evil."
26885397580,I cant help but hope that they lose all credibility with anyone ever.

26885413445,"As a swede watching this from the outside - this is how I see things. 1. A bunch of friends get together and decides to go out for dinner. They pick a restaurant and everyone orders lobster, drinks, blow and some hookers. 2. The check arrives and all of a sudden 20% of the dinner party starts screaming: No! We will not pay this bill! We dont care if this destroys the credit history for everyone! We need to save our money and should have stayed home eating bathtub minestrone instead! 3. The other 80% seems very confused and tell the 20% that since theyve already finished the meal, the blow and the hookers they really need to pay the bill and get out of there or else there will be dire consequences... 4. The 20% refuse to listen and one guy, lets call him Warfare Dazed Curl takes everyones wallet and burn them over the table candle while screaming that this is the only way. 5. Everyone in the party is pummeled by pimps, hooker, waiters and drug dealer that really wanted to get paid for their services. 6. Warfare Dazed Curl is stabbed to death on the senate floor."
26885415281,"They are trying to. But Obama isnt asking for any additional funding for anything new. The left arent asking for anything, just funding for things already passed. And actually some house dems have offered to cave on the medical devices tax for a short term funding of the gov.. which is totally retarded.

26885425758,It blows my mind that people still think the shutdown is ALL about politics. Its articles like this one that fan the flames if racism and hate for fellow Americans. Why cant we all get along.

Why in the world would the Republicans then go and say that the shutdown was all Obamas fault? If thats the case, thats terrific and Im glad he got elected so he could do that very thing! Why would the Tea Party want me to feel SUPPORT for Obama because he did something I ultimately wanted?"
26885432347,I dont know how this is news. They were blaming Obama for the shutdown before the shutdown.

26885442481,"Can you guys please do a switch, and throw the Tea Party in the water?"
26885442634,I cant help but think that this is partly the 35 and under demographics fault because we are not nearly as vocal in our opposition to these types of tactics. We cant expect to just show up once every four years to vote and think that is enough. 
26885448068,"As someone who spent most of his life as a republican, I reach out to my fellow right wingers and beg them to get their shit together and stop putting up with the lunacy that is the GOP.

Mr. Krugman, Youre egging on readers who are already strongly partisan. As such, you become part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Some of the policy positions of the Republicans are reasonable. For example, there are so many things President Obama could do to help ensure the long-term fiscal health of the country. He could address long-term entitlements, reform our tax code and fix Fannie and Freddie. If President Obama seriously addressed some of the reasonable policy goals of the Republicans, then youre opinion would make sense. But, he hasnt, so President Obama (and Harry Reid) and the Republicans all look childish. There is bad and stupid leadership and fierce partisanship on both sides of the aisle. None of this does the country any good. I wish President Obama had done more so I could agree with you, but he hasnt. So were all in a big mess, and there is plenty of blame to go around. Tempers need to cool, and youre not helping."

Government shutdown is not much of a bad thing but its risky. Sometimes there are benefits to it. Its not really about the ACA, Obama actually refused to negotiate about a lot of things regarding budget. Since the shutdown, everyone is witnessing what Ive witnessed in every election since I was 10 years old. Its like a kindergarten war on Recess, mud and insults flying. No offence but the Democrats have been really immature about the shutdown."
26885706461,No doubt the blaming was also in the plan.
26885716051,"What a bunch of spoiled, ignorant assholes."
26885717153,"As an independent, this makes all politicans look bad to me. People blaming one party nearly all belong to the opposing party. I see 4 major facts/problems that are causing the shutdown: 1. The government continually spends more money than it takes in and this disparity has been increasing for decades. This why the debt ceiling must be raised every 6 months or so to avoid a default. The debt ceiling is rising faster than GDP. This cannot continue forever. 2. The federal Government (and most states) has been steadily growing faster (i.e. spending) than GDP or population growth. That is a problem because the governments contributions to GDP are grossly inefficient compared to private industry. Continued growth of Government also cannot continue forever. 3. The tea party faction within the republican side of the house has decried that the US government is on the brink of a downward sprial of increasing interest on all that debt. They think the entire system is going to collapse soon and result will be at best drastic austerity measures, at worst total mad max style anarchy. While this may not be that case right now, it could easily happen in 10-20 years if the government continues to grow at a logarithmic scal as it has the last 10 years. 4. As our first president warned, the two party system can lead to dramatic splits in congress. When the house is divided, they cant tie their shoes much less agree on huge fiscal issues. The dvisiveness between parties today is not unlike that which existed before the Civil War (slavery was a catalyst not the cause as taught by revisionist History in High Schools these days). I totally unerstand what the tea party people are saying. I also understand that we appear backwards to progressive thinkers (i.e. lack of social safety nets). That said, our system is different from Europe. The States have much more power in the USA than other Western countries and they are often overlooked when talking about benefits and social welfare. Overlooking the power of the States is a mistake and ignores the lessons learned during the Civil War (poor economy + unwillingness to work together + a catalyst issue). Ignoring History in this case, could lead to some really terrible consequences. Reading the comments on reddit, it sounds like a lot of people hold so much angst towards the other party that they would be willing to go to war. I just hope it is only talk and people will eventually start to shut up and listen to the real problems we are facing so solutions can be found."

(Pardon the run on sentence). What sacrifice does he make? Long hours (boo fucking hoo - they do not compare to what servicemen deal with)? People not liking him due to his bullshit? He gets a pension after a single term, he gets to live in cushy comfort, he never will be shot at, he will never be forced to leave his family. He will never miss a holiday, a birthday, anything against his will. he will never break his back on duty. he will never blow out a knew on a long march. He will never work 20+ hour days for 6months to a year for far less than minimum wage. Ryan, and his ilk on the left right and center, can shove it right up their asses. He can take his expensively manicured hands and hair and fuck himself with them. Please pardon my language but strong language is specifically designed for strong emotions.

Its just more screeching insanity from the right in place of thoughtful discussion about policy. Nobody denies the wage gap exists, at best the right disagrees with how its being liberally measured by the left. All parties admit that there is a persistent wage gap; one side simply wants to chalk that up to all that free time off women get for having babies. No, Im not kidding. That is how the right tends to explain away the persistent gap in mens and womens incomes. Women make less because they work less, and they work less because they have the babies and were like the only major country that does not give paid time off for such.

Whatever it takes to get elected, they say that thing, usually some publicly-salient topic at the time. The hard thing to do is objectively look at what a particular politician accomplished during their term(s) rather than what they said. Then compare their actions/accomplishments to other people who occupied their positions at one time or anther. Edit: punctuation. "
26749619510,"Agreed. However, unfortunately, a lot of people will defend their guy when he gets caught lying or not living up to a promise by saying well hes a politician, what did you expect., like that makes it ok. Are we really going to vote people in based on what they say and then just shrug our shoulders when it turns out to be a lie?"
26749627175,"Right. And after the first term he should have known better, but I think the longer he is in office the harder it is to make anything happen. "
26749619656,"I dont necessarily think they say things just to get into office. I honestly believe he *thought* he could do the things he said he could do ([and according to politifact hes kept many promises](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/)), but once you get into office you learn things that are strictly privileged to being in that office and you realize that sometimes you cant complete the idealistic dreams you had while campaigning. Doesnt make it right, but lets have some perspective on it. "
26749630763,"Dont get me started on elections. Its kind of like South Park, where you have a choice between a giant douche or a turd sandwich. But seriously, the amount of money it takes to even compete for office, let alone have a chance of winning is ridiculous. This is the stage where you indebt yourself to those with vast amount of money and political interest who support you financially for future favors. When it comes down to actual elections, all you have left is a very specific kind of person regardless of the political affiliation."

If you want to see what would happen if someone against the status quo were close to getting elected to high office then watch [the revolution will not be televised](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-revolution-will-not-be-televised/). Regardless of what one thinks about Hugo Chavez this a great example of what would probably happen here if someone that the establishment hated was close to winning. This is how I knew that Obama was a big fat faker and Trojan horse. I didnt see any of the people or organizations that stood to lose billions if the status quo were threatened complaining about him. I judged the man by his enemies and not his words and I was the only one of my friends that didnt get fooled. Now I feel that I may have been fooled by Warren and am none to pleased. I am not certain yet though...
26827918202,"I was very pleased with Obama, and the insurance companies were not happy about Obamacare so much that the Republicans voted 27 times to have it removed and the 2008 Republican candidate swore to repeal it on his first-day.

They gather up the teen vote with their highly-partisan and inflammatory/passionate talk about changing the status quo and then accomplish ZERO objectives and promises. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/ Here we see 241 promises kept and 131 compromises.

It wont come with 500-promises-kept-and-0-broken thats a pipe dream no one can accomplish in a democracy where you have to trade favors."

26827908377,"Your hope in Warren comes from necessity. You want to believe shell live up to her hype. Just as others wanted to believe in Obama. Because when you take away hope, theres nothing left but a gut-wrenching void. No one can fault you for it. We all end up hoping, even if its unlikely anything will come of it. Which is precisely why modern politics is structured the way that it is. As long as the public buys into the perception there will be change, real change remains illusive."

Yes. &gt;We dont have to provide coverage and we dont pay any penalties. But if we choose to offer coverage, we get a tax break. Yeah, and the vast majority of small businesses arent going to start providing health care coverage because of the tax credit. Its [simply not worth it for most small businesses](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-22/explaining-obamacares-baffling-tax-breaks-for-small-business). &gt;Obamacare is lowering costs for small businesses like mine, and Im thankful for that. How is it lowering costs exactly? The tax credit doesnt cover all the costs of paying for your employees health care coverage. Your business doesnt end up making money by providing health care to your employees. The only thing it does is lower the cost of something that you *dont even have to pay for in the first place*. Meanwhile, [large chains who employ thousands of people across the country have already stated they will be cutting employees hours back due to Obamacare](http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/08/13/20010062-businesses-claim-obamacare-has-forced-them-to-cut-employee-hours?lite).

26917212770,Money paid to bureaucrats doesnt just disappear.
26917449360,My point of ignoring taxation and bureaucratic costs remains valid. 
26918330737,"&gt; Food stamp money is re-spend more in the U.S. (on average) before it goes overseas or into savings and thus it is better government spending Savings provides capital for investment. You cant expand production without investment, so spending is not what drives the economy. &gt;The USDA says the Food Stamp multipier is 1.79 meaning $10 dollars in spending provides $17.90 in stimulus - not great, but better than many other programs. The government entity whose budget is determined by the success of its programs claims its programs are successful."
26917166017,"&gt; Are food stamps effective? -economists say food stamps have a high multiplier i.e. the money is re-spent before it leaks out of the country. That ignores the source of funding. Theres the claim that a dollar spent on food stamps yields a $1.73 in the economy, but that dollar didnt come from nowhere. It came from taxes(and borrowing/printing is taxation too, just delayed taxation), and theres a bureaucratic cost to distributing that dollar. So, lets say theres a 30% tax rate and you need $1.25 to spend a dollar due bureaucratic cost(some evidence suggests its higher than that, but whatever). So you took $1.25 out of the economy in taxes and got back .3*1.73, or 0.52. Youve created a loss."
26917473115,"&gt; Youre assuming $1 dollar is removed from the economy via taxation No, Im assuming more than a dollar is removed for each dollar spent because of bureaucratic costs. Printing and borrowing are ultimately taxation as well, just delayed taxation. &gt;Your equation would essentially mean that any use of money by the government inherently is chipping away at the economy absent of a 300%+ return in identifiable tax revenue The subjective theory of value requires voluntary trade to create wealth. Since this isnt voluntary, you cant actually say youre creating wealth. &gt;Youre comparing the tax revenue required for funding to the money returned via taxation from spending. Not only is this a fundamental misunderstanding of what an economic multiplier actually is(or is useful for) and how it is applied to food stamp benefits compared to the lost business revenue, Im not misunderstanding it. Im *criticizing* it. &gt; but you manage to mislabel the Food and Nutrition Service as some form of bloated beauracratic waste while in reality it is one of the most efficient federal programs in terms of benefits to administrative costs ratio There is more to the bureaucracy than just the spending portion. Theres the collection and transfer and taxes as well. &gt;Even if you consider fraudulent gains of benefits, meaning people are receiving a benefit they do should not be eligible to receive, or the even less common selling/trading etc., that money is still positively impacting the economy due to the inherent velocity of the benefits compared to other economic activity. Only by ignoring where the money came from. Taking money from one place then putting it somewhere else at a nonzero cost by force doesnt create wealth, unless you create an equation that ignores numerous aspects of reality. "
26918096896,"&gt;&gt; lets say theres a 30% tax rate The taxing definately has a negative economic impact. But what I was discussing was forms of government spending. Food stamp money is re-spend more in the U.S. (on average) before it goes overseas or into savings and thus it is better government spending. The USDA says the Food Stamp multipier is 1.79 meaning $10 dollars in spending provides $17.90 in stimulus - not great, but better than many other programs. "
26917293961,"What...? Youre assuming $1 dollar is removed from the economy via taxation. That taxation leads to $1.73 in economic activity. There is a net gain in spending of money over the absence of taxation, despite taxation removing that money from economy to fund the program. In actuality this method of removing money from the economy is also false, since you cant consider an individual tax dollar and program spending is simultaneous to revenue, but thats beyond the point. Youre comparing the tax revenue required for funding to the money returned via taxation from spending. Not only is this a fundamental misunderstanding of what an economic multiplier actually is(or is useful for) and how it is applied to food stamp benefits compared to the lost business revenue, but you manage to mislabel the Food and Nutrition Service as some form of bloated beauracratic waste while in reality it is one of the most efficient federal programs in terms of benefits to administrative costs ratio. [Some info is found here, debunking lies from Michelle Bachmann](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/19/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-70-percent-food-stamp-fundin/) Furthermore, the end result of the program isnt only concerning tax receipts, but national economic health as a whole. The program is providing benefits exhibiting enhanced monetary velocity which has further reaching implications than your simplified equation purports, from immediate employment levels despite losses in revenues due to taxation, health of program enrollees, crime levels, the list goes on and on. You will be hard pressed to find a program more worth its weight in the federal government, and imagining that it must have some immediate and simple deficit-neutral budget impact is absurd even if you consider the incorrect assumption and math you use in your post. Your equation would essentially mean that any use of money by the government inherently is chipping away at the economy absent of a 300%+ return in identifiable tax revenue, which is actually a common but completely baseless argument against federal spending in efficient programs. If anything SNAP is too restrictive in its enrollment, the only major complaint that has basis in reality since the program is limited in the actual impact of fraudulent behavior. Even if you consider fraudulent gains of benefits, meaning people are receiving a benefit they do should not be eligible to receive, or the even less common selling/trading etc., that money is still positively impacting the economy due to the inherent velocity of the benefits compared to other economic activity."

I like how you put endorsed in quotes. That is quite accurate. It is used as a derisive term but has also become ubiquitous. There have been a number of polls asking the same questions about the legislation and when it is refered to as Obamacare it gets negative reviews where as the ACA gets primarily postive feedback. If Im making the argument for the Republicans then I am endorsing ignorance. However, I am not. Also, please disregard the man on the street polls that both sides are doing. They are specifically edited to reflect the goals of the poster. However there are a number of legitimate studies. "

With the exception of the folks that havent had insurance but now do, I dont see how either side of the issue can claim Success or Failure now, or in the immediate future. These are the *goals*. Ostensibly. The reality is that this legislation, and especially this administrations selective enforcement and nonchalance in illegally changing the requirements and exempting specific parties, has resulted in: A) fewer Americans actually being covered than before its passage due to the dropping of insurance plans B) less coverage for more money C) the removal or reduction of hundreds of thousands of full time positions D) a health insurance industry that is defunct due to its inability to keep up with near monthly changes in requirements E) the inability of many small businesses being able to maintain profit margins and meet legal requirements while remaining competitive vs. larger corporations.

Heavily-populated states are outweighed on a per-voter basis by less-populated states. The voters of Wyoming have more say, per capita, in the election than the voters of New York or California. "
27112800808,"Yeah, and I think that instead of picking a likeable candidate, theyre going to pick Hillary, and this will seal their demise. The voters in both parties already have a terrible history of picking the shittiest candidates possible during the primaries, and passing over the better ones. "
27112634764,"&gt;The first serious woman candidate will excite the hell out of the electorate btw. Youve got to be kidding. No one likes Hillary except the Obamabot crowd. The right-leaning voters certainly dont, and even many of the left-leaning voters dont trust her. If another serious woman candidate came around (Elizabeth Warren perhaps, she seems to be fairly well-liked and not despised like Hillary) and got the nomination, then I could see that happening. But this is unlikely to happen. My prediction is that Hilary will win the Dem nomination because of some Dem voters and the Dem leadership believing as you do (the first serious woman candidate!!!!), and then shes going to lose the general election because only Obama-lovers and the like actually like her, and everyone else either distrusts her or despises her. The right-leaners will vote for whoever runs on the other side, and the progressives will be so disillusioned after 8 years of Obamas BS, and will see that Hillary will be even worse than Obama, so they wont bother to show up. I know I wont. Ill just send in a vote for the Green party. &gt;Based on the enormous unpopularity of the republican party According to your preferred news sources, perhaps. From what I see, theres a lot of support for the Reps and even the Tea Party out there. Fox News didnt get where it is for nothing. I predict people like you are going to get a real reality check when a Republican is elected in 2016, and things in this country go from worse to even worse over the next 8 years. "
27112674601,&gt; Maybe well get lucky and get a Republican like Nixon. We call those Democrats now.
27112619285,"&gt; o it seems unlikely that Biden will be elected in 2016, or that any other Dem will; the voters just arent very excited by them. The first serious woman candidate will excite the hell out of the electorate btw. Also GHW was voted out by his own party for raising taxes. Based on the enormous unpopularity of the republican party and the demographic changes that keep chugging along (electorate will be 4-5 points less white in 2016 compared to 2012 and 8-10 points less white in 2020) Hillary has a HUGE chance of win AND be reelected. The whole point of 2012 was that the traditional model is now gone. The Nixon-Regan southern strategy is dead and the repubs. are basically screwed until they moderate which they show no signs of doing. "
27112590292,Thats one of the reasons I think Hillary is the only Democrat who could win it for them.
27112576771,"I think we can look forward to a Republican President in 2016. The reason is simple: we have a Democrat Pres right now. They tend to alternate. Were getting 8 years of Obama (D); before that, we had 8 years of W (R). Before that, we had 8 years of Clinton (D). Before that, we had 4 years of HW (R), and 8 years of Reagan (R) (so there was a break in the pattern there). Before that, 4 years of Carter (D), 8 years of Nixon/Ford (R), 8 years of JFK/LBJ (D), etc. Basically, we keep getting two terms of one party, then switch to two terms for the other party. The only exceptions are if someone is really unpopular, usually because of a lousy economy (Carter, HW), or if someone is really really popular but term-limited their Vice will get elected (HW). Of course, several of these 8-year terms are shared (JFK/LBJ, Nixon/Ford) because of the first guy dying or resigning and his VP taking over. In one case, the VP was re-elected but was so unpopular he didnt bother running for re-election after that, and in the other case the VP lost his only re-election bid. Obama is not really really popular by any stretch, in fact his approval ratings are pretty lousy, which is shameful considering how popular he was in 2008. So it seems unlikely that Biden will be elected in 2016, or that any other Dem will; the voters just arent very excited by them. This doesnt mean theyre all going to switch sides and vote Republican, but instead many will just stay home. The Republican voters instead will turn out in high enough numbers (because theyre sick of Democrat policies, and actually believe all the stuff the Republican politicians tell them), and a Republican president will be elected. Hopefully itll be a more moderate one; perhaps even Rick Perry, who recently said something in support of allowing carmakers to sell directly to customers, something that most Republicans are against (despite all their free market!!! rhetoric), and which I dont hear much from Democrats about either. You never know though; people could get angry enough to vote for some third party, and we might end up with a Green president. Dont count on it though; the last time we had a President from a new party elected was in the early 1800s when the Whigs fell by the wayside. Maybe well get lucky and get a Republican like Nixon. That would be much better than Obama; wed get far more progressive policies. From Wikipedia: Although Nixon initially escalated Americas involvement in the Vietnam War, he subsequently ended U.S. involvement by 1973. Nixons visit to the Peoples Republic of China in 1972 opened communications between the two nations and eventually led to the normalization of diplomatic relations. He initiated d¨¦tente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year.

In a speech about foreign policy dealing with Russia. Also Im going to go ahead and guess that you fall in the 25 and under group of Americans who for some reason have grown up to really despise their own country and people. Always willing to cast aspersions on their own country and people while not comprehending that the entire fucking World is filled with humans who are quite similar in intellect.

To imply that this in any way gives you a greater understanding of Russia is ridiculous, at best. Some other dumb things Palin actually said: He who warned, uh, the British that they werent gonna be takin away our arms, uh, by ringing those bells, and um, makin sure as hes riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that we were going to be sure and we were going to be free, and we were going to be armed. In re: Paul Revere, since she evidently didnt remember he supposedly said The British are coming, which I doubt hed need to tell the British. But obviously, weve got to stand with our North Korean allies. In re: what the U.S. should do about tensions between North and South Korea. Too bad she cant see Korea from Alaska, I guess.

Okay."
26970126593,"Politifact is garbage and this is just proof how bad it is getting. It was determined that there was in fact, a grandfather clause which allowed people to keep their healthcare plans. The problem was a select few insurance companies (you wont find competent providers offering these types of plans past the deadline after March 23, 2010) chose to continue to issue plans that did not meet the minimum criteria set forth by the ACA after the deadline were set. These were the poster-boy plans the media circus danced around. Basically just more manufactured problems from those trying to mentally justify their own preconceived biased beliefs.

26968823663,"Out of the multitude of lies told this year, even those by the Obama administration, I think this is not the lie of the year. Perhaps maybe the administrations attempt to say that the NSA was not spying on american citizens, or collecting cellphone data, or going after AP journalists to expose leaks, or about the drone programs, if they wanted to go the healthcare route, saying that the website for healthcare.gov would be fixed in a month... and these are just the ones with the Obama administration. There are plenty of lies out there, even ones put out by the Obama administration. To go after this seems a little weak and I think that if they wanted to focus on the white house in particular, there are *plenty* of other lies that could have been focused on that would have been much more beneficial to bring to the forefront than a lie that most people have already accepted as a lie and something that will generally be glossed over by the public at large. Again, if they really wanted to make an impact, they should have chosen something with a little less press coverage already because those who know it is/was a lie already know it is/was a lie, those who think it was a slip-up will continue to think that and those who have thought that the big bad government is out to kill them and their family will continue to think so.

Which, to most of us, means extra true, not mostly true. As for this whole debacle - what has really happened with that statement is that the spirit of that is alive and well. The President may have said those words and been wrong, but if instead he had said ... you can keep it, unless it is so bad as to become illegal. In which case, you are guaranteed to get a new, better and cheaper plan explicitly it wouldnt have been a lie at all. And that is the reality today, people who lost their plans did so because the insurers - not the government, the *insurers* - cancelled them. And all the people who were taken off those plans can get *better and cheaper* plans now thanks to the ACA.

26752955581,what do the numbers to the right mean? /blush
26752990692,The 0 stands for Senator and the numbers are district number. Because House districts change at least every ten years they are assigned a number.

If the Proctors income was a mere $2000 less, theyd receive more than $14,000 of tax subsidies to purchase insurance. Because theyre just over the line, they face an enormous effective tax rate on that extra $2000 of income. This is absolute, complete, utter bullshit. The subsidies are progressive. Someone making just under the 400% of poverty threshold doesnt suddenly get their entire premium paid for. No, they get a small subsidy. The subsidies get larger and larger the closer you get to 133% of poverty threshold. [Chart](http://www.communitycatalyst.org/doc_store/publications/Affordability_in_ACA.pdf) See, propoganda like this is why we cant have nice things.

If I got clothes and food at Walmart for $50, but Walmarts gone and now it the whole $50 for just the food at the grocery store, it doesnt look like Im going to a clothing store (especially if the clothing store is more expensive as well). Also, Walmart, knowing they pay crap and therefore cant get great employees, hires people that others may not be willing to. (2) Sure it seems unlike Walmart. It has worked at some large chains though (as an example, Whole Foods has a form of profit sharing they call Gainsharing). Its also fairly unlike most small stores Ive seen as well.

Yes, while we have seen wealthy aristocrats play a role in American politics since the inception of the United States government, this has by no means prevented the the middle or lower classes from contributing to the system. While a single wealthy individual can contribute millions to a candidates campaign, this has not stopped those with less money from pooling there resources together and attempting to get the bully pulpit to swing in their favor. So to at the moment limit the ability of a person to donate money as an act of freedom of speech when there exists no specific stipulation in the Constitution? That truly is an unjust act. For youre in a way stating that someones voice should count less all because you disagree with how they choose to spend their money. Its their prerogative to burn through it for all they care. That said, what can be done in this situation? For one, we respect the opinion delivered by the justices in this case, no matter who they were appointed by. Even if some areas of the law may seem morally grey, they are doing their best to make the standards of the constitution are met. Perhaps instead question how they may have approached that opinion, and above all dont simply label these five justices as conservative and unyielding regardless of the situation. I could easily do the same and claim the other four members of the court are only there to deliver liberal agenda decisions, but thats not what I believe at all. Theyre all there to deliver a decision and they all approach it differently through their interpretation of the Constitution. Remembering that, focus your efforts towards changing and influencing the legislation and amendments Congress creates. Have an interest? Great, now find a group of people with that similar interest, form a coherent group, protest/lobby, pool your money and/or raise money, and put it towards making the government do what you want. It may take work, but let it never be said that the American people dont have an equal share at pushing their government to pursue a certain course of action."

Its 24/7 speculation and conspiracy theories mixed with endless repetition. Its hard to describe the nonstop onslaught from the Democrats PACs and campaigns against the billionaire libertarian brothers. Democrats run ads, complain about them in mailers and jabber about them on cable TV shows. The brothers seem, in some cases, their prime issue. So far its been a frightfully expensive lark, not doing much to up the ante against Republicans. But the Democrats seem to think its the only way to boost their base. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid goes on tirades like this: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nev., faces reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 11, 2014 (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) The Koch brothers and other moneyed interests are influencing the politics in a way not seen for generations. Republican senators have come to the floor to defend the Koch brothers attempt to buy our democracy. Once again, Republicans are all in to protect their billionaire friends. Not only have Senate Republicans come to the floor to defend the Koch brothers personally, they have again and again defended the Koch brothers radical agenda  and it is radical, at least from the middle-class perspective. We get it  billionaires are bad, bad guys. Now, it wouldnt be so despicable  anyone in politics these days can come up with a distracting, unsuccessful bogeyman  if it were not for the sheer hypocrisy of it all.

According to reports, the Senate Majority PAC has only just begun. News reports tell us that the Senate Majority PAC is going up with a $3 million TV ad attack against Republicans in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan and North Carolina based on this message. But when you look at Senate Majority PAC and those taking their money, it is hard to miss  you guessed it  the out-of-state billionaires trying to rig the system. Who is the biggest donor to the Senate Majority PAC? Out-of-state billionaire Michael Bloomberg, according to the latest FEC filings. But he is not alone. There are a whole gaggle of billionaires giving to the Senate Majority PAC who hail from states which dont have Senate races in 2014. The list of billionaire donors to the outfit condemning out-of-state billionaire donors includes billionaires Eli Broad, Jon Stryker, Steven Spielberg and Dirk Ziff.

Shimkus:** So wait is it Medicare, is it using it to save Medicare or are you using it to fund healthcare reform? Which one? **Secretary Sebelius:** Both. **Rep. Shimkus:** So youre double counting. He asks her whether the cuts preserve medicare of fund the ACA. She responds, not directly answering the question, at which point he asks her once again it its to save Medicare or are you using it to fund healthcare reform? This question is further clarifying his original question of What are the five hundred billion dollars in cuts for to which she responds, yes She says that there arent cuts but it also sounds like she is admitting there are. I guess that is where my confusion lies. "

They arent cutting $500 billion from the current levels, and in fact, those levels will still rise. ACA just says, not by as much now, and is not meant to cut any Medicare benefits. And Im not sure what problem you have with the answer both. They are trying to slow the growth rate of Medicare expenditures. That can very well be argued to be both good for Medicares longevity, and to help offset some of the costs associated with the rest of the ACA. It doesnt have to be one or the other."

Seriously. Obama was solid as a rock, not pushing for a single restriction to civil liberties even after Aurora. Who could seriously believe Obama was simply biding his time after that? Well . . . they were right. The first major act of gun violence after the election and Obama and Biden launch an enormous push for gun control -- the most coordinated gun control push ever, with all major gun control advocacy groups playing an unusual supporting role for the Executive as he pushes gun control on a unified front. I hate it when the crazy and paranoid are right. I seriously do. It breeds paranoia and encourages people to separate their judgement from observable evidence.

It was the left that gave us the HMOs, an original attempt to control costs and cover more people and it got to the point where you have your list. And even with the ACA in full effect millions of people will still not be insured, more people will still die from a lack of coverage (though factually no one has ever died from lack of coverage but for a lack of care). And even more factually correct on who held up the ACA was the two Dem Senators who had to be bribed with special medicare coverage for their respective states just for it to pass cloture in the Senate. Stop acting like your side of the aisle is the only one looking out for the middle class when in the next couple of months another 7-10 million people will be losing their health insurance because of the ACA and the HHS changing the regulation language.

You are correct, I should have said the last 110 years. **[A Brief History: Universal Health Care Efforts in the US](http://www.pnhp.org/facts/a-brief-history-universal-health-care-efforts-in-the-us)** &amp;nbsp; In 1906, the American Association of Labor Legislation (AALL) led the campaign for health insurance. In 1912, they created a committee on social welfare which held its first national conference in 1913. Despite its broad mandate, the committee decided to concentrate on health insurance, drafting a model bill in 1915. In 1917, the US entered WWI and anti-German fever rose. The government-commissioned articles **denouncing German socialist insurance** and opponents of health insurance assailed it as a **Prussian menace** inconsistent with American values. In the Red Scare, immediately after the war, when the government attempted to root out the last vestiges of radicalism, opponents of compulsory health insurance associated it with Bolshevism and buried it in an avalanche of anti-Communist rhetoric. This marked the end of the compulsory national health debate until the 1930s. FDR  Wagner Bill, National Health Act of 1939 But there was one more push for national health insurance during FDRs administration: The Wagner National Health Act of 1939. Though it never received FDRs full support, the proposal grew out of his Tactical Committee on Medical Care, established in 1937. The essential elements of the technical committees reports were incorporated into Senator Wagners bill, the National Health Act of 1939, which gave general support for a national health program to be funded by federal grants to states and administered by states and localities.** However, the 1938 election brought a conservative resurgence and any further innovations in social policy were extremely difficult.** Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bills: 1943 and onward through the decade The Wagner Bill evolved and shifted from a proposal for federal grants-in- aid to a proposal for national health insurance. First introduced in 1943, it became the very famous Wagner-Murray- Dingell Bill. The bill called for compulsory national health insurance and a payroll tax. **Opposition to this bill was enormous and the antagonists launched a scathing red baiting attack on the committee** saying that one of its key policy analysts, I.S. Falk, was a conduit between the International Labor Organization (ILO) in Switzerland and the United States government. After FDR died, Truman became president (1945-1953), and his tenure is characterized by the Cold War and Communism. The health care issue finally moved into the center arena of national politics and received the unreserved support of an American president. Though he served during some of the most virulent anti-Communist attacks and the early years of the Cold War, Truman fully supported national health insurance. But the opposition had acquired new strength. **Compulsory health insurance became entangled in the Cold War and its opponents were able to make ¡°socialized medicine¡± a symbolic issue in the growing crusade against Communist influence in America.** Congress had mixed reactions to Truman¡¯s proposal. The chairman of the House Committee was an anti-union conservative and refused to hold hearings. **Senior Republican Senator Taft declared, ¡°I consider it socialism. It is to my "

Found out a black dude that had been there for like 3 years and was stocking the ever hated can good isle was making 6 bucks an hour lol. I told him what they started me out at and he clocked out on the spot and went home. Next day he had a raise and I got in trouble for talking about wages to other workers. But I felt like he needed to see just how shitty he was being treated. I quit shortly after that bc lets face it...... Walmart sucks. Edit - I was the only white guy in the overnight stocker position. Rest were black. And I started making more $ an hour than everyone else. And I didnt even ask for 7.50/hr. they choose to start me at that. Was a bit of an eye opener for me. I remember the guy that clocked out was bragging about making the big bucks and I laughed and told them all what I was making. I couldnt believe they were being fucked over so badly.

26812242999,"The person that wrote this is fucking retarded and should never try to write about finance/economics again. Comparing capital gains on stock ownership to ordinary income? Saying that Walmarts COST money to taxpayers, when the workers would likely be taking more subsidies if they were unemployed? Everyone that thinks that Walmart is the problem is a fucking idiot. "
26811413124,"So, why arent Republicans attacking this government welfare beneficiary? Oh, thats right...because its a **corporate** welfare check."
26811716363,So were paying half the labor costs for Walmart to shovel us goods made outside the US. 
26811478536,But I saved a nickel on my box of twinkies.
26811613959,"The central question revolves around whether or not multi-national corporations should have a moral obligation to their workers to treat them as actual human beings that need to feed families or can they just treat them as costs that should be cut to the bone in order to improve profit margins which in turn gets their stock price higher. If you side with the costs argument, then how do you justify the humongous pay gap between upper management and lower wage earners of the company. Certainly the corporation should hold every cost to the same standard. Unfortunately this is not the case. Using a measure of CEO compensation that includes the value of stock options granted to an executive, the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was 18.3-to-1 in 1965, peaked at 411.3-to-1 in 2000, and sits at 209.4-to-1 in 2011.-Economic Policy Institute report http://www.epi.org/publication/ib331-ceo-pay-top-1-percent/ "
26811691909,"Why the fuck has Wal-Mart become the rallying cry? Wouldnt EVERY employer of minimum wage workers be guilty of these same things? Wheres the Starbucks outrage? McDonalds? Lowes? Etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc. Im against anything that singles out specific companies/people. Theres never going to be a Make wal-mart pay more Act. "
26811952647,Conservatives love to rail against the welfare state. The same welfare state that subsidizes the labor costs of all those corporate interests that conservatives love so dearly.
26811466417,"No, it said a typical Wal-Mart *could* cost $1.7 million per store per year *if all the employees availed themselves of all the government assistance programs for which they qualify.* The study had no way to determine how many employees were availing themselves so they had no way to know how much it actually does cost."
26812005562,So Walmart costs US tax payers about $8 billion a year. Nice...
26812085946,"Ah capitalism. Isnt it just wonderful that we get to tell people get a fucking job, and then refuse to pay them a living wage, and then chastise them for not having a better job, and then complain that our tax dollars go to supporting their employer? Its almost as if Wal-Mart employees arent actually people too and we shouldnt care if they get paid shit because hey we get to spend very little at Wal-Marts. We obviously want them open and to get that end, we need to have people working them. But those people must not deserve a living wage and they are pieces of shit for relying on government subsidies. Its clearly their fault. Its so easy to just walk in and grab a CEO spot anywhere. What lazy bums. **Seriously, raise minimum wage up to a living wage.**"
26812215617,"A serious chicken-or-the-egg fallacy. The same could be said of ANY minimum wage job. The reason theyre on the government dole is because they dont make enough money. The reason they dont make enough money is because they dont have any particularly valuable skills or education, and as a result, they get a job at walmart to help out somehow. "
26811659000,"This type of analysis is trash. Lets look at whos really benefiting here. The top 50% of people in this country pay virtually all of the income taxes. 97% to be precise. So when we say taxpayers, were talking about people who make over $38k a year and over. Not exactly stellar, but not exactly poverty either. So now we know who this subsidization is costing, but lets look at who its benefiting and how much exactly. According to [this study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w11809) Wal-Marts low prices made consumers better off by 25% of food consumption. The poorest quintile in America spends about 26% of their income on food. In other words if youre in the bottom quintile, shopping at Wal-Mart will boost your income by 6.5%. So lets add all this up. There are 24,217 households in the bottom quintile and they make anywhere between 0 and $20,259 a year. Average that out to be about $10,000 per household times the number of households and you get $242,170,000 total income for the lowest quintile. Now assume that only half of them shop at Wal-Mart for groceries. The total income boost to the half of the lowest quintile that shop at Wal-Mart is $7,870,525 per year. TL;DR: The top 50% of households pay an extra $1.7 million a year to subsidize Wal-Mart which at the very least boosts the income of the lowest 10% of households by more than $7 million a year."
26811680695,"I am a liberal but also a realist; if Walmart can staff their stores and pay these dirt cheap wages, why the hell wouldnt they? Because people will stop shopping there? No they wont. Walmart has zero incentive to behave any differently, and its their exploitive cutthroat approach that has made them as successful as they are. If anything is going to change, their hand needs to be forced, and not by natural forces but by government regulation that sets an ACCEPTABLE bottom level of living for employed persons in the US, and enforces it using minimum wage and safety net programs. "
26812072434,This is what American capitalism is: socialism for the rich while the rest of us starve.
26811655535,While this is bad for Americans One should remember that wages were high once upon a time and businesses were not laying off employees because of it. If the minimum wage were to be 11/hr then yes prices would go up but people would have more money so they could consumer goods at the increased price. Europeans pay much more for goods then we do as americans and their middle class lives more comfortably than ours... Must have something to do with the wages being higher there My biggest issue is that these corporations like walmart and apple now have so much money that they do not know what to do with it so they play politics and lobby. Increasing the minimum wage would be a good first step to stop that.
26811672750,This applies to every minimum wage/low paying job. Not just Wal-Mart. 
26811452065,"This completely ignores the taxes that the typical Walmart store creates, including millions in payroll taxes, sales taxes and corporate income taxes."
26811476263,"Wal-Mart turned the notion of socialization of losses, privatization of profits into a science., gotta hand it to them."
26811451815,"This article lacks any economic point. The price paid by Walmart is the market value for the labor. Walmart is not a monopsony. If other companies were significantly better, then people would work for them. Some may not have a choice (as Walmart will hire nearly anyone while others might be more selective in hiring), but most do. They make the choice to work at Walmart out of convenience or choice or for whatever reason. Apple profits are in no way related to its wages. Nor should they be. Apple is a luxury product retailer. It is selling goods well above the market rate because of its brand appeal. It is not selling normal goods. The profits are a function of this. Its higher status does not mean that the labor it buys is worth more. especially on the low end. Say I invented a machine to mine gold from sea water. The machine was completely automated. all it requires is someone to monitor it and replace modular components. It was very efficient and extracted all of the gold in the water it processed. I would make millions per hour. Would that mean that I should pay someone millions per hour to monitor it and replace its components? Of course not. The McDonalds example makes the least sense. It is highly automated with little room for advancement. Why would anyone seek it out as a career? It is tedious work with no value. At best, it serves as a way of offering experience. Nothing more. Why should the company pay more than it needs to pay? Does this Buchheit asshole pay twice as much when he goes to McDonalds because he can afford to? It would really help out the franchisee."
26811770661,"Im 100% sure that Walmart execs know the exact statistics, and count it as a victory because its money that comes from someone elses pockets, and not theirs."
26812054819,"You know what else is great about Walmart? When they open a new store, they demand incentives from the local governments, and their stores require road improvements to serve the store itself. Something else that taxpayers have to pick up on Walmarts behalf. "
26811400937,They learned from the Oil Companies. Then they want tax breaks to locate stores in the District of Columbia and to retain the right to pay crap wages to their employees. What a great American success story.
26811709479,"And if people gave a shit, they would stop shopping there. If you dont like what WalMart does, then take your money elsewhere."
26812042466,"If money going to Walmart employees is the problem, why not just take away minimum wage laws and then take away welfare? Then, we can mow down child labor laws, truth-in-advertising laws, and health regulations, since all of these things get in the way of improving the shareholders bottom line. Because at the end of the day, arent they the _real_ victims?"
26811844134,basically they are relying on the tax-payers to sustain their workers while they profit. VERY CAPITALISTIC.
26812131352,How much does it cost the government to subsidize the unemployed?
26811553647,they are the largest employer besides the US government... NO ONE trying to work 40 hours a week (and getting cut off at 38 to deny health care) should have to be on food stamps. yada yada about free market and all that- wal-mart is CREATING its own welfare state and a burden to the People. 
26811734051,"Walmart drove out all of the mom and pop stores, and smaller stores that were their competition. Those stores also on average paid more to the line level employees than Walmart. Walmart can now pay what they want because there is nowhere else to go. Its also worth noting that the figures being used represent the average of full time employees. Many of their employees are kept an hour or two below full time and make much less than the $12.76/hr. they are also put on schedules that change often so getting a second job is quite difficult. Walmarts business practices have real social and economic consequences for the whole country. "

26811414469,"The title implies that a WMT store creates new costs that werent there before. This isnt true. Without WMT, these employees would either be unemployed or working at other retail stores *also* paying a minimum wage. Theres very little other options. WMT doesnt move to California and steal Steve Jobs to work there. These people are unskilled labour. So we need to compare pre WMT to post WMT. Not current WMT to utopia WMT where they act just as you *think* they should, ignoring all laws of economics. Otherwise, with that standard being put in place, everybody costs the government some amount, because I can easily create a law or world where they would pay more. It doesnt make sense."

26811475407,"Shouldnt the cost to taxpayers be compared to how much government subsidies these employees would use *if they werent employed at all*? Under the fantasy logic of this post, Wal-Mart could hire every unemployed person in the country and would suddenly cost taxpayers more money because of all those people using fewer government services than before. Heck, under this fantasy logic, I could give a homeless person a dollar and suddenly cost taxpayers thousands because I didnt give him more."

26811488744,"The modern US Corporate business model: Government subsidized costs, privatized profits. "
26811492281,"The problem is less that of minimum wage, and more of the fact that we dont have a maximum wage. We should tie executive pay proportionally to worker pay. Limit the salary of a CEO to 200x (or something, thats an arbitrary number I pulled out of my ass) what the lowest paid workers in the company get. So, if they want to have people work at the $8 or so minimum wage we have now, the most the execs can be paid is 3.3 million. If the company is successful, then it can afford to pay its workers more, and it can raise the pay of the CEO accordingly as reward for good work. Thered still be a reason to improve the company, at every level, because the more successful it is, the more everybody gets paid, and if it is not successful, the CEO doesnt get to loot the company and escape with a golden parachute. Right now the CEO of McDonalds makes $20 million a year, and a *full time* minimum wage worker there makes $16,640 a year. Does the CEO of McDonalds work 1200x harder than the bottom workers? I can accept that he works hard. I can accept that he brings in enough money to the company that he should be paid a lot of money. But if they can afford to pay him $20 million, they can afford to pay everybody else a little more. And if you make it so its set in stone that as you get promoted within the company your pay will go up to a certain multiple of your original pay, like 2x for store manager, 20x for regional manager, something like that, imagine how hard people will work to be promoted. Maximum wage, not minimum wage. Lets make businesses a cooperative partnership between employees at all levels, instead of a system for exploitation."

26811510173,"Alright, so Im open to arguments, but I dont know that this costing taxpayers $x per employee is a very fair claim to make. Now, to be clear: Im not referring to any shady hours-shifting to push people into part-time designations. The shitty nature of that kind of thing is a given. But, in terms of they pay so little that employees have to rely on government/taxpayer aid -- is that really a ***cost*** that Wal-Mart is ***creating***? I mean, if not for their employment at Wal-Mart, would these people not have to rely on ***more*** such aid? Given that, Wal-Mart would be ***reducing*** taxpayer costs to subsidize these people. The costs would exist regardless -- theyre just lesser if the person is working [at Wal-Mart]. Its not like if these people didnt work at Wal-Mart theyd suddenly disappear from existence; theyd still be reliant on government subsidies (and more-so). The aid is something that society is providing these people because they believe they should have certain needs met, expressed by a certain dollar value. If society is the relevant party looking to maintain such a quality of life for these people, ***shouldnt*** society be the one footing the bill for any shortfall?"
26811525209,"OP should actually link the study, not some article that mentions it offhand. Indeed, the actual study claims that the cost is $1.7 million *per store*, not per employee.

Thats part of being a civilized society. You dont offer social programs and then bitch about them when its convenient for going after the boogie man: corporate america. Ive never been stuck working at a walmart. Im relatively sure it is a 100 percent voluntary process. Could someone crunch the numbers for me and tell me how much walmart employees would be costing us if walmart didnt exist and they had no job at all? Oh...look. I just did the numbers in my head and its fucktons more. "
26811535297,"Replace Walmart with publicly traded big box retailer. Walmart is no saint, but they are not the problem. They are rational actors in our current system. "

In that time, no small local stores have closed and Walmart hired a few hundred people locally, including my son and many of his friends. As an added benefit, the only local chain grocery store had to lower their grocery prices because they now have competition."
26811564664,"I dont get why Walmart is the big bad guy; a lot of places pay people low wages. Instead of turning this into an attack on an individual company to show how much of a villain they are, why not use this information to solve the problem and promote a higher minimum wage. Making Walmarts public image a little faction worse than it already is wont accomplish much change. Please note In my personal opinion our inflation devaluing the minimum wage is a bigger problem then the actual minimum wage. Inflation is the biggest legal heist ever. "

26811615386,"They wouldnt be able to pay them such low wages if the fallback system (Food stamps, medicare, etc.) were more tightly restricted to those who truly need it. I have several scumbag family members who receive such benefits and they continue to work under the table jobs or low paying jobs such as these, the reason being that they will actually take a pay cut if the get a better paying job when the federal benefits are redacted. Its a catch 22, really, except theres no one to blame but us. I firmly believe that if we removed such aid (or capped it in some manner) then 1) people would have to get actual jobs that pay back into the economy, and 2) these jobs would have to pay more or people simply would not work them.

26811627581,"Microsoft does the same thing to the system but with contingent staffing rather than real employees. They recognize that each year, a contractor has to take 100 days off (http://www.directionsonmicrosoft.com/sample/DOMIS/update/2000/04apr/0400tf1b.htm). Now one might say it is the decision of the person to stay contracting, which is true. But you have to look at this from a different perspective. MSFT offers access to things that most other companies do not. Beyond the fun oh shiny, 100 days really is not a long enough period of time to land another gig once you have a few tours at MSFT under your belt. MSFT knows this and knows that people will continue to come back; there are plenty of times where an orange badge (temp) will be told about an opening coming up for a blue badge (fte) gig and that will keep them coming back year after year. When fte spots are traded between orgs as currency, and job security is used as a bargaining mechanism, there is little-&gt;no incentive for an employer to bring on extra headcount and expenses (they have to cover benefits, office space, etc) with a system in place they can milk. So what happens to the THOUSANDS of orange badges in the Seattle area who are without work at any given time because of this practice? Unemployment of course! Sure, there are many other ways these two do not parallel each other but it always shocked me that nobody tried to put an end to this cycle. Well thats not entirely true...MSFT found a loophole called vendors which allows for non 100-day breaks but I imagine its only a matter of time until a few vendors go after MSFT for the exact same thing as linked to above. I hated this process when bringing new people on my teams...I hated knowing that people busting their butts would never see an FTE role no matter how many open headcount spots there were. /rant **TL;DR** Walmart is not the only system leech.

26811640500,"Firstly, how can the net impact of a business operations tax burden be calculated if you do not also consider the amount said business pays in taxes? Something the referenced article does not do as it was a piece more geared toward which company (of those they compared) pays the least/most. Secondly, you can argue all you want that part time employees or employees earning minimum wage create an increased tax burden in terms of the public services they might engage in. But why do they bear no responsibility in and of themselves? Why is there such a rush to label companies and businesses (who are paying their taxes as prescribed by law) as evil and not even question how the individual employee is making decisions that greatly affect their tax burden? How is there no culpability assigned to the individual? Lastly, it is not the role or responsibility of any citizen, corporation or business to ensure the income, health and well-being of anyone else. It is up to the individual to choose what path their life will take. What education they will obtain, what job they will engage in. "

26811645818,"Heres some random observations to throw out that can be taken however you want. Nobody is forcing you to work there (yet). Its not like there is a similar job that requires no qualifications, work history or degree/cert that is paying 15.00/hr and these poor souls happened to end up at the Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart can only pay so low because people are still lining up to work there. That being said, since the standard for being employed by Wal-Mart is ultra low, you usually get ultra-low quality employees. Now dont get me wrong, Wal-Marts business practices are transparently malicious, as to not hiring full time employees and the ultra-high turnover rate (which may be costing them more in the end). Anyhow, Im so sick of the sob story that Wal-Mart employees will never be able to afford med school on their salary. Give me a fucking break. If you can pass a drug test and know how to make yourself look somewhat presentable and are *actually a hard worker* (key point) there are jobs to be had where you can make well above Wal-Mart wages. Wages you can actually get yourself an education on. The only thing about it is it takes *lots and lots of hard work*. Something (judging books by their covers) that I dont think many hourly Wal-Mart employees are too acustomed to. Finally, The reason Wal-Mart is such a big issue is because when they build one the stores fucking *thrive*. My girlfriend and I absolutely disagree with Wal-Marts business practices. So ya know what? We dont shop there. Ever. People need to realize if you think Wal-Mart needs to pay their employees more, and really feel that strongly about it, maybe you should be paying Wal-Mart less. "

26811695697,I JUST bought some cat food and cat litter at a walmart by my work here in wisconsin. Am I going to hell because it was the closest place to buy cat food near my work and I was only on my lunch break so i didnt have any time to go further. fml
26811724520,Is anyone else like me and be all anti walmart online but then you shop there anyways cuz its just so much cheaper it wouldnt make sense to shop at whole foods or new leaf or target 
26811725019,How much does each soldier cost us? Id rather subsidize a civilian corporation that is providing cheap nick-nacks than subsidize the bombing of brown people. Call me crazy. Im just not a fan of bombing brown people.

26811737540,"What about the millions of people that work jobs that pay less than Walmart? I wonder how much they cost? I look at it the opposite way. Walmart and other low wage jobs are offering a service to our nation. They are employing many who have refused to educate themselves, stay out of legal trouble or refuse to conform to social norms (neck and face tats etc.) These jobs are doing a great service to our nation by subsidizing those who already receive government assistance."
26811742679,"This reminds me, I am WAY behind on my shoplifting."
26811743681,"Guess those prices arent so low, huh."
26811745280,Why is it always Wal-mart? Damn near every major supermarket in America pays their employees minimum wage too.
26811746052,Or they could just pay their workers.
26811756663,So if the Walmart didnt exist and these people had no job the government wouldnt be paying anything? Retarded stat.

26811763665,"Wouldnt it cost us just as much if not more if they werent employed? Walmart is gonna sell shitty stuff, pay low wages, and haters gonna hate. Dont shop there if you hate the store."
26811765354,This is all policy from Jesus/Republicans. They understand a good man wants to get rich off the backs of the poor and not allow them access to medicine.
26811765879,"I love how these Nutters are defending Walmarts practices. These are probably the same people pissed that people get assistance in the first place. Which is it because it cant be both. Either Walmart is bad for providing work but not at a living wage so we have to pick up the slack, or Walmart is awesome because we pick up the slack where they FAIL and they laugh themselves silly all the way to the bank. Frankly when someone is screwing me, I dont ask for more of the same, and I sure as hell dont applaud them for it. "
26811780670,"Im sure its just the cost of doing business - our cost, society suffers."
26811797951,"Minimum wage increase or subsidies, doesnt matter, wealth re-distributed. Just sucks that tax payers that dont shop at wal-mart have to chip in."
26811807229,"The real question is what would people rather pay, higher prices at walmart or higher taxes? Id rather distribute the cost to taxpayers if it meant lowering prices for stores where the poor mostly shop. Then again, how much of that goes to Walmart and not the employees?"
26811819219,"Am I the only person that sees that the clear problem is that there are thousands of underemployed people and that the solution is to create higher paying higher skilled jobs? There will always be demand for unskilled low paying jobs, theyre called teenagers. The real problem is that grown adults *shouldnt* be working minimum wage jobs for extended periods of time. The reason they are today is because the economy is still suffering and they are underemployed. So, instead of making their lives easier flipping burgers (which generates almost no benefit for society) we should be finding ways to either give them the necessary skills to move on or create more jobs that require the skills they have."

26811829199,"People are not responsible for themselves. Its the governments duty to protect us from ourselves by: *) being sure our employers are forced to respond to populist pressure instead of market pressure *) being sure we are paid more than we are worth which raises the cost of goods and lowers the standard of living for everyone who succeeded *) propagandizing us from childhood to believe that if anyone doesnt like something, they hate... that if anyone is successful its because of their parents money, their evil doings, and the color of their skin... that people who overborrow and overspend for their education in an unmarketable subject are victems... that if you fail... it isnt your fault. No one is responsible for themselves. I think its fine for people to talk about how Walmart should pay more, or McDonalds, or whatever else... What I dont think is okay is the willful ignorance of the statement a mother of two working full time at Walmart... If you work at Walmart you probably shouldnt be a mother of two. You probably should have done something with your life instead of breaching two welfare children before you could be worth more than $10 per hour. You should probably take a little responsibility for yourself. NPR had a gentleman on yesterday who works at Burger King and makes ~$9/hr and was protesting and demanding more money. He kept making reference to not being able to support the family of 4. He talked about his wife going back to school to become a nurse assistant. That is a job that requires very little training and is essentially a janitorial job... emptying bedtrays and giving spongebaths. Its not exactly going back to school. If you want to succeed, learn something the market will pay for. If you want to succeed, dont stay working at Burger King... Spend your off hours applying for jobs rather than complaining on the radio. If you want to succeed, take out student loans and go back to school to learn a real trade that pays real money at a technical college or inexpensive 4 year university. If you live somewhere (like MA, PA for instance) where 4 year schools are $30k/y+ THEN MOVE AWAY. Dont take out $120k in loans to pay for school that you could get for $30k!!! Its cheaper to move to SC and pay out of state tuition than to attend many colleges which is why my school is full of people from out of state. My school advertises in these markets for just this reason. There is a way. You have to be responsible for yourself. You have to wake up and decide to actually do something about it. Or you could just keep QQing."
26811832073,"A better question is What is the difference in cost to the taxpayer if Walmart employees were employed by someone else? If they had a poorly paid job elsewhere, the problem would still be there, but some other mom and pop retailer might be getting the government subsidy. People work at Walmart because the market doesnt offer any better jobs. The little retailers that Walmart put out of business are just as crappy. [Mean hourly wage](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes412031.htm) of retail is $12.17, a tiny bit less than the $12.78 that Walmart pays. edit: [according to BLS, cashiers](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes412011.htm) get an average of $9.79 and a median of $9.12. Given that Walmart associates a mix of floor workers and cashiers, this makes Walmart look a bit better. "
26811841734,maybe we should just cut away the government subsidies then.
26811841895,So Walmart cant pony up another few million in payroll to get these people out of poverty? We should be ashed to shop there. 
26811845651,"Anyone have the number of stores to extrapolate Walmarts cost to the tax payers overall? Id look but Im mobile. Edit: Holy damn, 4,253 stores total. So someone else said the realistic estimate was more like $900,000 per store on average so at 4,253 stores that would be $3,827,700,000 annually. That is quite a bill for the taxpayers to be pony up."

26811852788,What revenues does each Walmart bring? 
26811853183,Sounds like that is working as intended.
26811864587,"So heres the $1.7 million question. Do we blame Walmart for hiring workers at market rate, or the US government for giving handouts to people who have jobs?"
26811864884,"This suggests to me that the public should stop subsidizing Wal-Marts expenses by ending the provision welfare and government health care, so that Wal-Mart would be *forced* to bear the full cost of employing its employees instead of being *enabled* to offset their expenses onto the public. "
26811869536,How much do single moms cost society?
26811871550,Will raising the minimum wage eliminate these subsidies?
26811877080,Republican answer? Get rid of the subsidies. 
26811881604,"Next up, re-legalization of slavery, to improve corporate profits. "
26811889088,Shouldnt government assistance be pegged to working 25 hours @ minimum wage or something...that would force them to either raise minimum wage so that these people dont rely on assistance or cut assistance down and deal with those consequences. This is ridiculous and allows these companies to game the system knowing that the government will pick up the rest of the tab.
26811895709,"Odd how this thread assumes that everyone on the government tit is just dying to get off, yet the numbers of them keep rising. What to do? Blame the biggest guy in the room. Most people who collect from the government fuckin love it and they live in that system of barely give and plenty take. Why work extra hours or get a better job when that magic check just keeps appearing?!"
26811904474,I wonder how much a typical Target store costs taxpayers. Or a typical Dicks sporting goods store? 
26811907460,"From the first page of the study, the actual number was around $3,000, not $5,815. It says could cost up to 5,815. Whenever you see the words up to, you know somebody is blowing smoke at you. This was prepared by the staff of a democratic subcommittee of congress. Any idea what a typical democratic subcommittee costs the taxpayers? Hint: its a lot more than $5,815. "
26811908608,"So, basically, we should shop at Walmart since were already paying for Walmart in some way. "
26811920343,I only buy ammo at walmart. Everything else they sell is garbage.

26811932767,"Its gotta come from somewhere and if you dont produce anything, further anything or technologically advance anything, its gotta come from somewhere else."
26811935670,"The crazy part is that even though I am currently sitting on my lunch break from Walmart (where I have worked full time for the last seven years) I have never been eligible for any state or federal aid. Granted I am a single male with no children. I agree that this company needs to pay its associates better and even in some stores treat them better (however the treatment of associates is very dependent on the management team). I have a unique perspective in this company because I have climbed the ranks into salaried management and through some health issues had to step down to take care of myself. I can honestly say that at least within most regions the stores and associates and management mean well as a whole. Some of the policies can be crazy at times but honestly I have been paid and treated worse at other companies. However, YMMV dependent on the management team involved."
26811941461,Where else am I supposed to buy the cheap crap I dont need? Target? Fred Meyer? Costco? 
26811948705,This is the kind of stuff that make people want to raise the minimum wage to outrageous levels. ...not that I can blame them. Id rather not have to subsidize EVERY SINGLE Wal-Mart. 
26811949962,Whyd they have to test in Wisconsin? I have a feeling there is at least one comment bashing Wisconsin...
26811953569,"the company pays extraordinarily low wages to its store workers, an average of about $12 per hour, or $24,000 per year for a full-time employee. In-store salespeople make up about half of the total workforce Apple pays its U.S. employees only $1 for every $8 in profits. Are people going to ignore this and continue to rip on walmart and mcdonalds because they are perceived as evil capitalists? But its a living wage!"
26811955503,Seems like majority of our taxes help the very few and multi-national corporations and leave the rest of us in the dark. This on top of the recent study on how 121% of economic growth since the recession went to the corps and 1%.

26812007562,Solution: Stop shopping there. Nothing else will change anything.
26812008008,employees reliance on government subsidies does that mean welfare/food stamps?
26812012452,This thread: People defending Wal-Mart barely paying their employees. I will never understand you silly americans.
26812017126,"And every year, the members of the Wall family are on the very top of monied people in the world. Theyve gotten there with our taxpayer dollars and their disregard for their employees."
26812018318,"Funny, at the same time this study was published, Walmart was advertising on every cable news network. Kind of neat how that works out."
26812019101,As opposed to all those people being unemployed and 100% reliant on government? You know what costs taxpayers money - public sector jobs that pay 30% more than their private sector counterparts.
26812020004,"Was this study from the same KU freshman that decided that doubling McDs payroll would add 60 cents to the Big Mac, that was TOTALLY debunked within 24 hours?"

26812043877,"And the Teabaggers will continue to shop there. Low prices, low morals. "
26812052214,"Well, but how much does the average unemployed person cost taxpayers? Its not $0, but is is more than or less than $5,815 (i.e., how much does this save/cost relative to an unemployed person). Not saying that Wal-Mart has any intention other than maximizing its profits, however, the most relevant statistic(s) arent discussed here."
26812053708,"so this is pretty common knowledge but what continually mystifies me is that small business owners believe the GOP lie that whats in the best interests of the gigantic corporations that the GOP is bending over backwards for is indistinguishable from whats in their own best interests... ???? if anything, a small business owners interests are far more aligned with welfare recipients than they are with walmart! theyre certainly far closer in terms of revenue and profit taken in."
26812055776,"I know this will get buried, but the math seems unlikely. In order for those figures ($1.7M per store and $5,815 per employee) to be accurate, each Wal-Mart store would need 292 employees."
26812057262,"Is it possible that this is the sign of a functioning welfare system rather than an exploitative corporate system? Maybe the people who work at walmart arent contributing enough to the economy for the economy to support them, so the government is stepping in to make up the difference. Honestly I think this is probably a better option than doubling or tripling the minimum wage. As nice as raising the minimum wage that much sounds, do you really think that a Walmart shelf stocker should be paid as much as an entry level teacher or other professional? People should be paid based on how much they contribute, and if that isnt enough to live on, then its the governments job to step in and make up the rest so we all have a reasonable standard of healthcare, nutrition, etc."
26812065064,And how much do those people being unemployed cost taxpayers?
26812073102,But the prices are so cheap!! The real price tag is hidden from the consumer who doesnt have the brains to realize what is happening. Its why a free market isnt really fair when a large percentage of the participants are not aware of the true costs.
26812073900,"I work there, I dont take any taxpayer money, but then again I live with a bunch of people sharing rent so yeah still a shit pay. "
26812074256,I know we have lost a lot of freedoms in this country but you still have freedom of choice. People dont have to work at wal-mart. People dont have to shop at wal-mart. The market will take care of itself. And just for the record my daughter works at wal-mart.
26812074407,raise wages now please
26812077000,"For comparison, the economic impact of a Walmart store averages about $150 million (assuming a 3.0 multiplier)"
26812077741,And yet people will still shop at WalMart
26812085956,So when do we begin the uprising and kill all of those that prosper off of the backs of (almost) slave labor... ...just need a time and location of when I need to show up with my pitchfork outside of one of the Waltons homes.

I mean I get that theres people that get 100% of there pay from these jobs but lets be real people, fucken burger flippers get minimum wage, thats the rules of life."
26812111380,"It seems like no one has addressed the point that Walmart paid $6 billion in US federal and state taxes in 2009 (for example). With more than 4,000 locations in the US, that works out to $1.3 million in taxes per location (guessing 4500 locations), which is $400,000/yr more than the actual guess this study puts forward of $900,000/yr in government welfare. Things should be put in context."
26812119860,Just think how much more it would cost tax payers if Walmart didnt employee them. Stupid article. 
26812122508,WOW a STUDY!!! it must be true
26812123875,isnt this also assuming that the walmart employees are also full time?
26812131947,How much do taxpayers pay for people in jail for cannabis? 
26812134508,"The main point is, the Walton family is the richest family in the entire world while Walmart employees do all the work and dont even get a living wage for that work. That employees (that is all of us) pay the taxes that support them because the Walton family wont raise their wages. Something is going to give way -- and soon. Raise the minimum wage to a living wage before there is rioting and civil war. WE CAN STOP THIS! We can stop the wars to come. Just raise the minimum wage until people are able to survive. That is how you end rebellion. Listen, if you dont support the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013, the U.S. will be thrown into civil unrest by 2015. Ive seen this all before. Ive studied history. Raise the minimum wage or face the consequences. "
26812138637,"I know this certainly isnt a popular opinion here, but businesses are not the ones who set the low wages for employees who work at places such as Wal-Mart. How much should an employee of Wal-Mart make? What true skills do these workers have that gives them a competitive advantage over another that would allow for a higher wage than someone else? If you pay someone at Wal-Mart $15 an hour, what does a teacher deserve to make? What does an accountant deserve to make? What does an actuary deserve to make? What does a soldier deserve to make? People are paid (for the most part) what their skill set permits. Wouldnt these increases in wages then allow for businesses to charge more for their products and then, proportionately, the majority would still be in the same position they are in? Goodbye sweet karma."
26812140634,"Pretty much a bullshit analysis, but it is certain to entertain the low information liberals in r/reddit."
26812149636,So if Wal-mart didnt exist these people would magically have higher paying jobs? Right.. Every economic study shows that when you raise minimum wage there are less jobs. So you want to permanently take away jobs from people that are willing to do it? How much does a permanently unemployed person cost to support? What does that do for their psyche?
26812150067,"Anyone who thinks that raising the minimum wage will fix everyones problems is SADLY mistaken. When you increase the minimum wage it costs companies more to make their items, and guess how they are going to recuperate that? Exactly!! To the people that say but walmart employees are un skilled laborers, how much do they deserve to make? Well Costco pays its employess an average of 17/hour with benefits. Oh, and they let their employees work 40 hours a week so they can qualify for benefits. Walmart is NOTORIOUS for having employees work 36 hour weeks just so they dont qualify for health coverage...now that is scandalous. "
26812153903,TIL a typical Wal-Mart store employs 292 people.... Yeah right... 
26812160698,"Did they factor in the much lower employment rate were Walmart not there?...I, honestly, didnt read it...but I dont understand how Walmart literally costs taxpayers money (unless theyre cashing in on energy or something)"
26812166779,"I was down South recently. In this poor town in Oklahoma, they were practically begging for employees, especially in Wal-Mart. Never seen this anywhere. There were tons of people shopping in there, but I think most of them were on welfare. I saw the same people working in the morning AND in the evening! I came back twice in the same day. Its sad. Wal-Mart is the worst run company. I worked for them a bit when I was younger. I lasted about a month. The people that kept working there after I left look like shells of their former selves. Every time I go shop there, its like going to hell and seeing lost souls. The smarter ones usually escape after a few years though."
26812174445,Yeah. And our local governments give them MORE via TIF and shit like that. ARGHHHHHH
26812184375,"&gt; Because of varying program eligibility requirements across states, extrapolating taxpayer costs for Wal-Mart stores in other states based on the Wisconsin data is difficult. Wisconsin¡¯s poverty rate stands well under the national average, so it would be reasonable to assume that the households of Wal-Mart employees in other states would be more likely to qualify for public assistance. On the other hand, Wisconsin¡¯s Medicaid program eligibility requirements are more inclusive than other states¡¯, meaning many WalMart employees in other states could find themselves ineligible for Medicaid while their Wisconsin counterparts of equivalent incomes would be eligible. Um... yeah, not very good science here."
26812187338,Why the fuck does everyone hate wal-mart so much that theyll upvote this without reading the study... which is blatantly biased and not based in good science? 
26812192469,Well thats less money than having these people simply on welfare so whats the problem ?
26812195877,I dont know why you are complaining. /r/politics seems overwhelmingly in favor of the government picking up the tab for everything anyway.
26812205642,I get all my taxes back. Im poor too.
26812207922,Why is using government programs considered a shameful thing? 
26812220559,"Because the workers wouldnt rely on government aid if they didnt work at walmart, right?"
26812222025,"And rather than suggest walmart pay more, the gop is trying to just get rid of the subsidies for the employee."
26812233799,So lets say that Wal Mart could replace a lot of their employees with robots and automation at the check out aisle. Thats the plan long term anyway. At that point what does it matter how much employees are being paid when there are less jobs? Youre worried about subsidising workers? When the US has perpetual 15-20% unemployment we will beg for the return of the evil days of corporate employers like Wal Mart. Another thought is why doesnt a store like Target take a more social angle and pay their employees more and sell it that way publicly kind of like Costco? I think that would be a good move for them in theory. Maybe the real problem is that would not improve their sales at all and the consuming public in general doesnt care. 
26812236962,"Maybe I missed it, but where is the study and who did it? Maybe Im blind, but I didnt see that information in there which is kind of important and interesting. "
26812237457,Think how much they would cost if they didnt have Wal-Mart to work at.
26812253624,"Wal-Mart is no different than most other big box stores in this regard, but in a normal economy, the people that should be working at Wal-Mart are high schoolers and college kids. I think that the conversion to robotics will turn those jobs into moderately skilled labor. Someone on site will likely be required to have the skills to fix it, so we should be seeing a wage bump soon... just not the one that people would like. The main gripe that people should have with Wal-Mart is their horrible service, most of the time. I dont shop there because of that, not because of what the market is charging for non-skilled labor."
26812280377,"Im a bit late to the party, but have two links to share: Walmart isnt the only company guilty of huge profits while their employees take home squat, fast food companies like McDonalds and its wage war has been gaining publicity. Heres an enlightening clip from the Colbert Report I saw last month: [Colbert slams the laughable McDonalds budget](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/427948/july-22-2013/minimum-wage---mcdonald-s-spending-journal) which stipulates that if you get a second job, work 75 hours a week, pay $0 for heat, $20 for health care (that would be a government plan, as McDonalds insurance plan is closer to $60 if you qualify), and $0 on food you can even save $100 a month! While searching for that link, I also found this article. It has some good information while advocating against minimum wage increases: [Forbes on minimum wage nuances](http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2013/07/23/mcdonalds-minimum-wage-budget-ignores-tax-credits-food-stamps-and-reality/)"
26812288936,mabey we should cut the subsidies?
26812349903,We go into 1 trillion bucks of debt per year so... no biggie right?
26812361384,"Doesnt take into consideration how much taxes Walmart paid ([$7.1 billion in 2012](http://www.forbes.com/2011/04/13/ge-exxon-walmart-apple-business-washington-corporate-taxes.html)), or how much Walmart saves consumers ([about $50 billion a year](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/27/AR2005112700687.html)). If anything, Walmart tends to disproportionately benefit the poor. "
26812406346,"This is really misleading. When you say X costs taxpayers $Y per year the implication is that the budget in question *would have $Y more* if X did not exist. Walmart pays them very little money, sure, but if Walmart did not exist, these employees would make even less, and they would be *more* dependent on taxpayer funds. So Walmart may have awful wages, but it *is* a net benefit to taxpayers."
26812431197,And thats where your low-low prices come from. I hear there appear to be a lot of empty wal-marts. I dont know how that works actually. How come these wal-marts are abandoned? 
26812470218,"At a certain point, electoral politics starts to seem superfluous. There are really a handful of families bankrolling the republican party (Koch Brothers in energy/paper; Waltons in retail) to keep very particular forms of government regulation in place. Why not go after these people directly instead of going through the unwieldy process of winning control of all three branches of government?"
26812543841,wish corporations like this that had employees on food stamps and subsidies were forced to pay the difference in addition to their regular corporate tax. Might encourage them to raise wages a little bit.
26812544713,Walmarts philosophy seems to be race to the bottom. On employee wages and benefits. On American goods vs cheap crap chinese ones.

26812562288,So each wal mart employes close to 300 people? I thought it would be closer to around 50 or 60...
26812572047,ultimately this is all because of a miserably failed 30 year trickle down economics policy. the idea was to free up some money to corporations so they could better compensate employees. guess what? corporations simply decided to keep all the extra. these stories are the end result. it looked good on paper. not so much in practice. this bullshit has to end.

So maybe the common sense question this study brings up is: maybe we should take a good hard look at just how much were wasting on food stamps in this country. 
26812807483,I read the study behind the title of this thread. It is 99% polemic and 1% unsupported facts. Walmart may indeed be bad for our society but there is no factual support for the assertion in the title of this thread.
26812990941,"Have you been to Walmart? Are we assuming that without Walmart, those employees would have better jobs? Or that if Walmart just paid more....all their employees would be that much better off? Certainly Walmarts success is driven by their cheap prices. Do you think Id tomorrow they doubled everyones salary, theyd continue yo be as successful and employ the same number of people?"

26965061837,"This. In the 1970s the department of Housing and Urban Development, responsible for providing housing to the poor, *spent more money on administration and other overhead than they did actually building housing.*"
26965282337,"Citation? A more relevant comparison, Medicare (a government-run healthcare service), currently (not 40 years ago) spends &lt;2% on administrative costs and overhead. Well below the 10-15% overhead of private insurers.[^(1)](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/30/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-medicare-overhead-far-lower-pri/) &gt; The trustees¡¯ summary listed total Medicare expenditures of $522.8 billion for 2010, of which **$7 billion was characterized as administrative expenses. That works out to 1.3 percent** - &gt; CBO cited data, compiled by the McKinsey Global Institute, that estimated administrative costs for private insurers at 12 percent [...] A different measurement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pegged the amount for private insurers at 11.1 percent for 2009"
26965499892,"I cant dig up a citation quickly on the internet, its a factoid I learned many years ago in economics, when it was still a contemporaneous issue. As for your data - I dont buy it, because I dont believe that the numbers correctly reflect the inefficiency of the system, but instead paint the picture that the trustees wish to paint. Look - Im a business process expert, and I dont make that claim lightly. Ive done a lot of work helping businesses become more efficient. So I pretty much vomit every time I have to encounter the healthcare system (and note - I in NO WAY defend the employer-based private insurance system that preceded Obamacare). Ive worked with businesses so lean its hard to believe they are able to function at all - you walk in a factory and it almost looks like its gone out of business. So it doesnt take me three minutes of experience with the Medicare system to know that there is an enormous, unaccounted-for, heaping, steaming pile of waste - and fraud - buried within every Medicare payout. For instance I understand that for every hour of patient services, it requires 1/2 hour to complete the Medicare-specific paperwork - but this isnt accounted for by your numbers, since its assumed in the cost of the medical service being billed and simply appears to Medicare as a beneficiary payout. TL;DR 1. the employer-based insurance system is a bad system 2. but the idea that Medicare is not just more efficient than private insurance - but at &lt;2% overhead possibly the most efficient service-delivery business *in the world* - is so patently false that we should begin by fundamentally distrusting the numbers presented."

Spend the majority of it right? Now if you give the Waltons an extra $100 a month, what are they going to do with it? Well considering that they are already sitting on a pile of money, I imagine its just going to go in the pile. Also, you say no wealth is created and thats a fallacy. If enough people start making more money, than they are going to buy more things and its going to increase demand to the point where companies will have to higher more people to make the things people are demanding which now means we have more people working, more money, more demand.

27086273091,"&gt;You are discounting so many things like how an increase in wages for people who end up spending 100% of their money juices the economy in a multiplying manner. The minimum wage is a transfer of wealth, correct? We say walmart should pay more thus transferring the wealth from one party to another. No wealth is created and an increase in the minimum wage doesnt magically make money appear in the economy. So that being said, how is this any different than what is already happening? In other words, what do the Waltons (or whomever) do with their money that prevents it from juicing the economy in a multiplying manner? "

Well considering that they are already sitting on a pile of money, I imagine its just going to go in the pile. Yes youre right if you give someone living paycheck to paycheck more money they will spend it. If you give the Waltons more money they do not sit on the pile. What they really do with it is invest it or put it back into their company or put it in a bank. In all these scenarios the money is still going back into the economy. So it doesnt matter who you give it to. If the Waltons put it in a bank, the bank lends it to a company or a person who then spends it. If they invest it, the entrepreneur or company they invested in will spend it and it will still go back into the economy. So you still havent proven how it goes into the economy for one party and not the other. If rich people stuffed it into their mattress or something, yes youd be correct but a rich person who does that wont be very rich for long. So the argument that the economy is juiced is patently false."
27128121826,"&gt;Socialized health care systems get better results This is subjective. There are certainly plenty of examples that we can cite where the US is exceedingly better. Something like 30,000 Canadians go to other countries and pay when they could get treated for free, 25% of people in Canada going in for surgery wait a month or more for that surgery and up to ten weeks for an MRI just to diagnose. In survival rates of cancer patients the US leads the world. We receive the benefits of the latest pharmaceuticals sometimes years before theyre available to UK or Canada. So again, I dont think the blanket statement better results applies. &gt;for cheaper If I walk into your grocery store and you try to charge me $10 for a bag of apples and I flash a gun or badge or something and tell you, Well Im only going to pay $3. That doesnt mean it was *cheaper* for you to provide those apples to me. The cost is the cost. Just because we let guys with guns and special privileges tell us what to buy, doesnt mean the cost of providing that service changes. Its really not as cut and dried as everyone in this subreddit, and every other liberal for that matter, would like to believe. This is a matter of fact."
27128332493,"&gt;Stupid fucking argument when in the neighborhood of a million Americans go out-country every year for healthcare tourism. Relevant argument considering Americans dont get it for free. Canadians do. If you get it for free, why choose to pay? If you have to pay then you choose the best mix of price and quality for you. If you dont have to pay then it would be completely irrational to opt to pay, right? &gt;For non-emergency care, yes. How does that compare to the US? I dont think it matters if its emergency or non-emergency care. In an economic transaction resources have to be rationed and I would consider getting care quicker to be maybe, just a little, tiny, benefit of health care. &gt;My god you are hitting all the highnotes on bullshit lies about single payer healthcare. Do you read from a playbook or do you actually believe the shit you are spewing? Where is the lie? The source you cited says what I said, no? From your source: &gt;It¡¯s certainly the case that we have higher survival rates than the United Kingdom and other countries with nationalized health care. Across the board, the United States boasts a higher five-year relative survival rate than the European average, according to a 2008 study in the British medical journal Lancet. For breast cancer, for instance, the U.S. survival rate was 83.9 percent, the U.K. rate was 69.7, and the average European rate was 73.1. Thats what I said. I didnt say anything about insured vs uninsured so your article does not address the claim at hand. Then they make the argument that the US is only better because it catches it earlier by saying this: &gt;Thus, countries with more advance screening will have higher survival rates even if they don¡¯t have better post-diagnosis care.

26887600691,"Just wondering if you knew that every single democrat senator voted against raising the debt limit in 2006. Here is a quote you might think is from some GOP politician: Increasing America¡¯s debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means the buck stops here. Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. Therefore I intend to oppose the effort to increase America¡¯s debt limit. This is actually a quote from Barack Obama."

They make for great drama--accuse the other side of being feckless while using the staggeringly large numbers as a moral bludgeon--but the thing is, everyone knows (or used to know) that the measure was going to pass, that nobody would let the U.S. actually go into default. Congressional leaders may be incompetent in, you know, actually leading, but one thing they do well is count votes. If the outcome were in any doubt in 2006, theres no way the Senate Dems would have voted as they did. They knew they could make a symbolic gesture, score some opportunistic political points, and then get the debt limit increase everyone wanted anyway. This is in no way equitable with the present situation, for which there is no historical precedent. (The closest parallel was when the Democratically controlled House held the debt ceiling hostage trying to get concessions in 1984 from the Reagan White House, but they capitulated after a single day.) A plurality of Congress members actually are looking forward to a default for reasons that are difficult to fathom. They are sprinting toward that cliff and the fallout ([Goldman predicts drawback of 4.2% GDP](http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-on-failure-to-raise-the-debt-ceiling-2013-10) if we hit the limit) could be staggering.

Next his president Jimmy Carter started giving Social Security annuity payments to immigrants who never paid a dime into the system.** I started paying Social Security at age 12 in 1957 and put in over 50 years into a system that between Johnson and Carter is now going broke. **Please read the original FICA contract and follow it to today and see how many changes have made by the Democratic Party.** **As for pet projects, middle class taxes, business cronies, foreign governments, I think he has just given a very good definition of our current president.** [source](http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/opinions/letters/article/Blame-Democrats-not-Republicans-for-problems-730274.php) Then he went on about how Bush wanted to cut Social Security benefits. No, in the first place, **Bush wanted to privatize Social Security so that people earned more than the measly 1% or less that they currently earn on their investment in Social Security. No, the Democrats would have nothing to do with any idea that didnt involve government.** And adding to the retirement age? Well, people are living longer. When Social Security was first implemented, the average lifespan stopped at 65 years. So half the people never received any benefits from Social Security. Now the lifespan is around 80. Something must be done. People have to work longer or if they want to retire sooner, they have to save more privately. The math doesnt work otherwise. **He then says about Republicans, Their central goal is to hack away at government. Perhaps this is the only truth that Dionne stated in the article. Government is the root of most of our problems. We do need government but only to resolve conflicts of liberty between people, organizations and countries. Otherwise, it is the worst way to solve any societal problem. Its ability to solve poverty is a great example. Trillions later after the Great Society of the 1960s, and the percentage of poor has not changed. Think that might be human nature?** Dionne obviously thinks that stimulus helps renew an economy: Obama and Democrats in Congress enacted a substantial stimulus. The package should have been bigger, but Obama - thinking he would have another shot later at boosting the economy - kept its size down to win enough votes to get it through Congress. **Stimulus went to financial institutions, either directly or as bailouts to other industries in which financial institutions were the main beneficiary, or the unions in the case of GM. Remember the great profitability and the bonuses in the financial industry just a few months after the bailouts.** Few of those stimulus efforts ended up as helping production nor did they end up in the hands of consumers. Maybe a few jobs were created but mostly those jobs didnt produce things that people needed or wanted. [source](http://www.cavemannews.com/REPUBLICANSTheyreToBlameForEverything.htm)"

26743047117,"Your comments are completely wrong and ignorant to the issue of Social Security. Do you even know anything about the issue that you dont read in **liberal news** sites? Educate yourself, better luck next time.. If you privatize Social Security, those funds that are used outside of government are not as readily available for the Governments general operating revenue. **The result is that Government will have to be more creative in conjuring up ways to increase taxes without getting the masses all riled up.** This can be done by reducing allowable deductions on mortgage interest and other deductions (charitable contributions, property taxes, limits on health care costs, etc.) or by increasing taxes or imposing taxes on items not generally taxed. **Bottom line, its a cash reserve or pot of money that Congress does not want to lose.**"

27096834414,"You mean when he referenced Charles Murray who said that some people are born lazy? I believe that argument is thoroughly discredited. There is a difference between name-dropping a few academics, and engaging with the academic argument. If he was doing the latter, he would need to acknowledge the large and persistent role that structural factors play in creating poverty. Quite a few of these academics are intellectual shills for their ideological presuppositions, mind you. If you want a second example of referring to the academic argument, look at the Regnerus fiasco."
27096867846,"&gt;You mean when he referenced Charles Murray who said that some people are born lazy? I believe that argument is thoroughly discredited. Its true that Murray has made that argument, most notably in The Bell Curve. But thats not really a culture of poverty argument. I assume that what [Ryan is referring to](http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/03/13/paul_ryan_and_charles_murray.html) is Murrays more recent work, like Losing Ground and Coming Apart. Those books are much more closely tied to the culture of poverty literature. &gt;There is a difference between name-dropping a few academics, and engaging with the academic argument. Of course, but you have to remember that Ryan was doing an interview on talk radio, not giving a presentation at a poli sci conference. And the interviewer [specifically asked](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2014/mar/14/context-paul-ryans-poverty-comments-racial-attack/) Ryan to focus on the culture aspect instead of structural factors. (Bennett: Part of it is the economy, part of it is policy. But there¡¯s a cultural aspect to this, as well, right?). I think a better reflection of Ryans views is the House Budget Committee [report](http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/war_on_poverty.pdf) that Ryan and Bennett were talking about (and that Ryans staff authored). It takes a more balanced approach, and acknowledges that Changes in family structure, changes in labor-market opportunities, and changes in broader demographics are a major part of why widespread poverty still exists. The report also talks quite a bit about the role that federal anti-poverty programs play, which I think would count as a structural factor. You may not agree with the conclusions Ryan draws -- and for what its worth, Im skeptical about a lot of them -- but I think its unfair to say Ryan was just repeating a racist dogwhistle. "

What Obama said wasnt forthcoming, but neither is anything any politician says. Death panels anyone?

Most and by most, the vast majority, would keep their plans. You will always find outliers who have some insane plans that can no longer be used and as such can not keep their plans. What Obama said is basically true, except for a small minority but the bipolar Americans now call it the worst lie ever.

26921069966,"Well, I suppose that he figured that people who would be getting booted off their insurance because it doesnt meet their needs would not be liking it, he would be correct. Remember - politicians rarely *outright* lie. They just bend the truth or say something in such a way that it can be perceived in a way that they didnt actually say thing. So if Obamas justification was that nobody should be happy with a plan that basically doesnt take care of you and you pay a bunch of premiums to, only to find out that when you need care you dont get cared for. So, those people are not part of the If you like your insurance crowd. Unfortunately, what it doesnt account for is various employers seeking to find a way to make sure that they make a liar out of him or find the cheapest way in which to pay their employees while also allowing the government to pick up the slack. This was a miscalculation on his part. This is *not* on the same caliber of other lies, such as saying that there are death panels, that there are weapons of mass destruction, or any number of significant lies within the last decade. Death panels were justified in being talked about because they spun the ability to judge what is and isnt covered as death panels (they conveniently left out that insurance companies do the same). The issue is, however, that theyre not deciding who lives and dies, theyre deciding care. They were also using living will directives as part of this, and that is basically the discussion with your doctor about end of life care. It does not encourage you to die - it simply encourages you to tell them what you want them to try and do to keep you alive, its your choice. Combining the two lead to death panels, which is still better than the weapons of mass destruction statement. The weapons of mass destruction statement was often quoted, and spoke on, as We know they have them, *we gave them to him*. Remember - we fought against Iran using Iraq and the reason Saddam existed in the first place *was because of US interference in the area*. So while not an outright lie, the idea of a mushroom cloud somewhere was very, very far fetched. Understand, though, that politicians find a way to be right. I recall a moment with me and my wife where I had that same streak of ingenuity. When questioning why I was picking out something that I previously didnt like to wear, she said it must be because Im right, because it does look good. I responded, I was not wrong - its still ugly. I was simply right, I can make anything look good. Politics is about choosing what to say, when to say it, how to say it and making sure that what youre saying is covered at some level in order to save your ass by walking it back. Politicians rarely *outright* lie, but theyll mislead and misdirect whenever possible."

Im a 23 year old male, and I now have to pay for maternity coverage. In no way am I *better* covered for anything more than I was before, and Im going to be paying out the ass. Im sorry, but **more** coverage doesnt mean **better** coverage. Oh yea, and I make a little bit too much money to qualify for any subsidies. Fantastic, because I worked my ass off and graduated in the top 5% of my class with an engineering degree, I now get to pay for everyone elses shit. I hope some kind of medical miracle or divine intervention happens, and I get pregnant. At least then Ill get some use out of this. Higher premiums, higher deductible means more out of pocket cost, all for provisions that I dont want or need. I was fine with my plan before. "

What he meant was, If you like your plan, you can keep it - unless, of course, you have a bare-bones, catastrophic plan that actually doesnt cover much, but you like because its fairly cheap and youve never had to actually use it. In that case, youll have to buy a more expensive plan that meets the minimum standards of coverage outlined in the ACA. What he perhaps could have said was, If you like your plan, you can keep it so long as it meets minimum standards. This is not merely a distinction without a difference. Some people are going to be pissed about this."

26920949423,"Campaign promises almost have to be discounted as being a lie simply due to the candidate not necessarily having all the information necessary to make such a promise. Not being privy to classified information or not knowing the complete scope of a particular promise can affect the ability to deliver on the promise. That being said, I dont approve of just never addressing it. I would love to see someone ask him why he hadnt closed it and if he is sorry for promising something he couldnt deliver on. The you will be able to keep your plan is just taken as an absolute definitive statement. Had he said 94% of the people currently insured can keep their plan as it is, then there isnt any untruth to it. If someone says dogs have four legs, is it a lie? Obviously not all dogs have four legs but it doesnt mean that the person is intending to mislead by making the statement. "
26920987455,"I dont think the statements he made are lie. They were an over-simplification. His statement is true for 95% of people. There happens to be a small number of people who cant keep their plan because the plan they had covered so little, that it can barely be called health insurance. So they have to get a real health insurance plan, in many cases, with the costs covered. The law pertains to millions of people, and yes simplifying that law into a soundbite leads to some mistakes. This, to me, is different than lying."

If you dont know what I mean by that, just Google what Ron Paul thinks of spending in Reagan years. 2. Iraq War. Enough said. Every Republican complaining about costly health care should have complained about the lives and financial costs of Iraq, not to mention the benefits not being paid to veterans these conservatives claim to honor. 3. Tax Cuts. Pretty simple math, doesnt help government revenue when you cut taxes. 4. Big government programs like Department of Homeland Security and Bushs prescription drug program or laws like the Patriot Act. Yes, we might need them in this day and age, but they add to the size of government and were started under Republicans. So much for limited government principles causing a shutdown. 5. Republicans love to raise the Debt Ceiling when theyre in office: More specifically, it lists 18 increases to the debt ceiling between February 1981 and September 1987. In other words, there were 18 under President Ronald Reagan, as Obama said. And there were seven increases between January 2001 and January 2009 -- during George W.

26885705490,Who the fuck does he think hes speaking for every time he says the American people? I nor anyone I know recall asking for any of the bullshit hes pulled off.
26886254485,"Boehner: All we want is to have a conversation with Obama. He just needs to pick up the phone and give me a call and we could end this thing today. But he simply refuses to negotiate with us, and so were forced into this situation. Stephanopoulos: So if he did call you, would you be willing to discuss a clean CR that doesnt include changes to ObamaCare? Boehner: ABSOLUTELY NOT! NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS! WE WILL NEVER PASS A CLEAN CR NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!!! All were asking is that Obama negotiate with us. Thats all. Yet he continues to refuse to do so. Just call so we can have a real conversation about this, Obama. Thats all were asking. Stephanopolous: How about the debt limit? If Obama were to accept several billion dollars in cuts in exchange for new revenue, would you... Boehner: ABSOLUTELY NOT! UNDER NO POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD WE EVER EVEN CONSIDER SUCH A THING! TAX REVENUES ARE ENTIRELY OFF LIMITS AND SOMETHING THAT WILL NEVER EVER HAPPEN! EVER!!! Now if Obama would just call me so that we could have a conversation we could do something about this, but he simply refuses to negotiate on anything. It is his refusal to negotiate that keeps pushing us closer and closer to the brink of collapse. Stephanopoulos: But.... Boehner: ABSOLUTELY NOT! WE WILL NEVER EVER DO THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!! Now if only Obama were willing to negotiate."
26886120471,"What a deceptive person John Boehner is. HE is the one holding the gun, yet he wants to convince us that it would be someone elses fault if he chooses to use it. I recall hearing that sort of rhetoric used before, when terrorists take hostages and warn them against heroics. John Boehner is responsible, as in the one who is able, to initiate a vote an a *clean* continuing resolution. He doesnt want a *clean* CR, he wants a CR with provisions to attack an existing law he cannot directly defund, a law that was even challenged and upheld by the Supreme Court. He lies by saying that the votes for a clean CR do not exist. When he is confronted with that fact, he ignores it and reasserts his deceptive rhetoric about having a conversation. Does anyone else remember the extensive conversation we had when the Affordable Care Act was going through congress? John Boehner hopes that we, the American people, dont. John Boehner hopes that we, the American people, wont count the votes available for a clean CR. Maybe John and his party hope that we, the American people, forget that they shut down the government, caused it default, and thus damaged the economy, so that later they can blame the economic malaise on Obamacare and Democratic policies in an attempt to regain more power in government. The real question is, are we, the American people, gullible enough to fall for these deceptions?"
26885986328,The Right will have a lot of explaining to do when they lose the White House to a Women in 2016.
26886027415,"That was a poorly conducted interview. I get that Stephanouplous was trying get Boehner to essentially admit that he was bluffing, but he completely let Boehner go on the numerous attempts Democrats had made to negotiate and go to conference on the budget. And, he completely let Boehner off the hook by not calling out the fact that the House proposals to the Senate started off with the complete non-starter of defunding the ACA about 24 hours before the govt shutdown."

26886283029,"Serious question, would this be considered as treason? I think that its a pretty brazen attempt to overthrow (see: circumvent) the government to push personal agenda."
26885763106,"I want a conversation, I want a conversation, I want a conversation. How many times did that asshat repeat that same phrase. He is a drunken and incompetent fool who has clearly lost control. He refuses to schedule a vote he says because the votes are not there but he held 42 separate votes on defunding the Affordable Health Care act knowing that he did not have the votes. What a world class liar. "
26886107695,"When Boehner was asked what he was willing to put on the table for this serious conversation of which he is so fond, he listed a bunch of things he wants from the Democrats. Now Im no congressman, but that doesnt sound like a negotiation to me."
26885537319,He can feel the end of his career coming and it is getting to him. If he allows the government to receive funding the tea party will make sure he is never elected to any position again and with the extremists in the party I would suspect his life could be in danger. Many of them really believe this shut down will bring people to their side. If he doesnt fund the government for longer democrats will be flooding in money to make sure his district is full of attack ads and working as hard as they can to make any future campaign he tries a living hell.
26886159917,"Say conversation again. Say conversation again, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker, say conversation one more Goddamn time!"
26886019372,"I guess the keyword of the day is conversation, mentioned 14 times - once per minute."
26885890853,This guy is unbelievable. I think he actually believes some of the shit hes saying.
26886111018,"If the votes arent there, then whats the problem? The dems want the vote, and if they lost the vote it would make Boehner look good. Hed love to see a failing vote, yet hes claiming that there arent enough votes and wont do it. Its an interesting time in politics, watching a drawn out political suicide in action. The question is really how badly this will hurt the GOP controlled house in 2014. If the GOP is stupid enough to let the US default on its loans theyll be fucking gone from the political scene. Loans across the country will go up, social security checks will cease, military personnel in the field wont get paid. And a ton of other huge problems will arise. If that happens, watch the American public replace large amounts of the GOP. I almost want them to do it just so I can see them get owned. ...Almost."
26885895212,"Everytime you hear the phrase have a conversation, drink."
26885813550,The amount of projection coming from that man is unreal.
26886277670,How many times did he use the word conversation or sit down and have a conversation. Did they not have one before before the damn thing got passed? They lost. Get over it. This is coming from a Right leaning independent.
26886109601,Lying piece of shit. 
26886151074,say have a conversation one more time..... say it one more goddamn time..
26885574839,"Conversation, conversation, American people.... Freaking broken record."
26885681973,"I didnt see him lose it in that video. If anything, he looked like he was being desperately careful, almost like someone was holding a gun to his back and ready to shoot if he strayed from the talking points."
26886291384,"How many times did he say sit down and have a conversation? Seriously, they are programmed to say bullshit like this, they are robots. So if we kill them, we shouldnt feel too bad."
26886257599,"can somebody count how many times he says have a conversation... I cant believe that he (they) cant be arrested for impeding government, when I can be arrested for taking a shopping cart out of the mall. We dont negotiate with terrorists. "
26885607220,Fucking terrorist.
26886155711,John Boehner is a piece of shit.
26886240958,How are you supposed to pronounce boehner? To me it looks like it should be close to boner
26885743921,"Ugh, the problem is George never really calls him out on his lies. The average person watching this would probably assume he is a reasonable guy who just wants to talk. He is never called out on the fact that the GOP refused to negotiate on a budget for most of the year, that every other time a president negotiated during these crises it was never about undoing a law that the other side didnt like, or that the GOP has been planning this shutdown as a way to get their way on an issue that theyve lost on. George just keeps asking him the same question over and over and basically lets him appear to be the reasonable guy just waiting for the President to talk."
26885973428,"Can we talk about [this fairness meme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8GuMRxk5TU&amp;t=54s)? As I understand it, the argument is that we should be fair and allow citizens the same year-long exemption from the ACA that businesses have. However, I feel that this is 1. like comparing apples to oranges (a person buying health insurance for themselves isnt the same as a business paying for health insurance for its employees) and 2. a farce because Im presupposing (and please correct me if Im wrong) that the exception for businesses was a concession to get the ACA implemented."
26885939765,Never seen a more dedicated group of people? They take how many days off each year? I can go 500 feet and talk to people who work more days and just as many hours. 
26886155961,"you know i wish the president wasnt such a tool. when boehner starts whining about the spending i think boy it would be sooooo fucking awesome if the president grew a pair of balls and sent boehner a budget taht slashes the military spending of the country in half. he wants to demand 150 billion in cuts? fine cut military discretionary spending by half, boom 300 billion gone. then he can go to the media and say hey boehner wants 150 billion i gave him 300 billion in cuts, he still says no. take it to the people. lets see how many people want to keep paying for afghanistan or iraq or any of the military spending. shit you could cut those 300 billion and STILL have a bigger military budget then the next 3 biggest military spenders."
26886340147,Did anyone else see that little smirk when George said to him You are the man! You are the one man in Washington who has the power to reopen the government. Hes so fucking happy and proud that the entire world is begging for his mercy. What a damn sociopath.
26885644485,"Just dont forget who it was that wanted to the government to [cater to the rich and the corporations](http://thecontributor.com/how-redistribution-rich-has-broken-back-america), then shut down the entire government because they didnt want you to get healthcare..."
26886308425,"Waiting for Obama to say, I will not negotiate with terrorists. That would make my week. "
26885560641,So sick of this dudes bullshit rhetoric about a fair conversation. Weve had the damn conversation and it didnt go the way Republicans wanted. Tough titty said the kitty. Let the experiment go forward. Im already signed up for healthcare starting in January. Kinda excited about being able to see a doctor. 
26885680322,Has he started running away from reporters yet?
26886063689,"Jesus, this guy really wants to have a conversation with somebody. Fuck."
26885842116,He needs to lay off the booze.
26885589838,I will never not pronounce his name any other way than Boner
26886261188,can we have a conversation about a conversation we had years ago about that specific conversation?
26885767625,"He exhibits the classic speech patterns of someone who is out of his depth and on very shaky ground. He keeps repeating the same moronic and meaningless phrases and changes the subject every time an even slightly difficulty topic is raised. Basically, he is incapable of answering a straight question and uses absurd soundbites to respond rather than giving a straight answer. I found it hugely maddening to watch him to the point where I couldnt take it any more. The reality is this pondlife is hellbent on destroying the American economy and possibly the world economy too."
26885778126,"This interview was terrible. They just said the same canned phrases over and over, both of them."
26886160345,WHAT. A. FUCKING. SCUMBAG.
26886059862,"Im against John Boehner as much as the next guy, but John Boehner Loses It is more than just a bit of dirty media at play. The source is super liberal, which is fine. But Boehner, I thought, actually kept his cool and answered the questions in a calm and collected manner. He lied a couple times, and some of his facts were obviously wrong, but he didnt freak out and lose it. He rarely even changed in demeanor. I know /r/Politics is generally anti-Republican, as am I, but each side is exaggerating issues to make each other look bad. Also, Im 6 minutes in and hes said conversation or sit down and have a conversation 8 times. Its one of the more obvious political tactics. You have a key phrase you want the viewers to remember. In this case, Boehner wants people to remember that the Democrats are refusing to have a conversation. Notice he never said lets sit down and talk. Its an old media brainwashing technique. Thats his only goal with this entire interview. Btw, just in typing this paragraph hes already up to 12. EDIT: FINAL COUNT - 20"
26886323666,I didnt see a man get mad. I saw a very stubborn man repeat the same talking points over and over again
26885605978,"This once powerful leader is more and more resembling a ventriloquists dummy with the hand of the Tea Party shoved up his ass. I wonder if he really thinks that intelligent, knowledgeable people cant see completely through him? Stephanopolos obviously does. All I can think is that Koch Brothers money has come to mean more to him than his country."
26886228562,"My favorite part was when he blamed governments of the last 30 years for the problems he sees today, while ignoring the fact that hes been part of the federal government for 22 of those years. "
26885923301,The fact that people like this are allowed into a position where they can hold our country hostage from within disgusts me.
26886181738,"Rich people have rich kids, rich families, nice houses. They are comfortable. Whether the government is shut down or not. Thats why these Republicans dont care. They pretend to care because they need humans to vote. They dont care. They are chilling, relaxing. This shut down does not affect their childrens wellbeing. They dont care about yours. "
26885547374,"EXCELLENT COMMENT from the link, and I wish someone would call him on it on camera. *The Speaker allows time, energy and money on votes against the Affordable Care Act 42 times on any given day knowing he doesn¡¯t have the votes, yet can¡¯t quite seem to bring a vote to the floor to keep the nation running and not taking the economy further because he says we need to trust him that no one would vote for it. .*"
26886034660,"A few things I noticed here: He uses the word Fairness a lot. Is it fair to put hundreds of thousands of people out of work (who are responsible for doing a number of jobs that help keep Americans safe - i.e. Food Inspectors) Best interest of the American People was also something he said. Is it in our best interest to not have the people I mentioned above at work? Is it in our best interest to threaten our countrys first default, likely resulting in huge economic impact? Spiking interest rates where people cannot afford to pay back student loans/mortgages etc? He accused the Harry Ried of adopting a My Way or the Highway mentality. Is it really a My way or the highway mentality when the ones trying to be somewhat reasonable (and I use that loosely because most of those in Congress are idiots) refuse to give in to extortion in order to get a particular result? Is it my way or the highway because the House Republicans refuse to pass a clean spending bill because they are so opposed to a law that nobody wants, even though the country has shown that is not the case (even if it does need some changes). Is it my way or the highway to do all of this because a few are butthurt about ACA? How can you pass a clean bill without addressing the underlying issues - What exactly is the underlying issue hes referring to here. Because it appears as though the major hang up is the ACA - Which has been in effect for about a week. Squandering the future of our kids - really??? Shutting down the government so the kids of those who are being furloughed arent being adversely impacted? Because threatening to cause a default if we dont succumb to the extremists extortion attempts, which could have huge impacts on the ability of our kids to get loans to go to school, or to pay them back, or to get a loan to buy a car, or a mortgage, etc. isnt squandering their future? And most amazingly to me, we dont have enough votes to pass it. Then let there be a vote for crying out loud! If youre so certain, then allowing a vote would only help you in that it would prove that youre right. Let there be a vote, and at least give these people a chance to go back to work! Its just more finger pointing at the other guys. At this point, it doesnt matter whos responsible (even though its pretty apparent that its Boehners guys). What matters is that our country is f**ked if they dont do something fast, and not to mention that we are becoming a laughing stock around the world for this. Ive never seen such a lack of logic, intelligence, compromise, sympathy, or leadership in my life. It truly is disgusting. "
26886231654,Do you think hell cry?
26885807726,"How can we pass a clean debt limit while ignoring the underlying problem?... We have taken in less than weve spent for 55 of the last 60 years... Paraphrased a bit, but hes saying to solve this problem we need to give individuals a waiver that would exempt them from having to pay a fine (tax) if they dont buy insurance? Less revenue = fixing the deficit. Republican math."
26886260065,"If he says conversation one more time, Im gonna punch him in the dick."
26886398331,Boehner is a terrorist. He and the GOP have become existential threats to my country. Fuck this shit. Under a Westminster system all of congress would have been automatically terminated last week.
26885985392,Republicans: Under no circumstances will we compromise. We expect YOU to compromise. By compromise we mean we expect you to give us what we want. Or else.
26886162676,God damn if I hear the phrase sit down and have a conversation one more time Im gonna vomit.
26885768953,When he says The American people dont want this (In regards to the affordable care act) What does that mean? What does he base that statement on? Did they do polls? Im not even american and Iv seen some polls... Dont more people want it?
26885694015,I dont follow this AT ALL! What are the 3 lies in the transcript?

26885965034,Would be funny if it wasnt so sad.
26885965634,"At what point did Boehner lose it? Im not a Republican by any stretch, but these bullshit sensationalist titles to try to get karma are so disingenuous. Downvoted."
26885983903,BONER
26885997823,I think we need a Boehner conversation count on the bottom of the video
26886021870,I must have missed the big melt down. Or wait... Is this what they call sensationalistic journalism? Too funny...you guys thought I was a Republican didnt you. Nope....No way...And still dont see it.
26886026437,John sit down and have a conversation Boehner
26886031166,"If he were right, would it do any harm (to the Republicans) to have the vote? "
26886061864,"I never thought Id say it but Boehner has a point. The government is writing checks for toys (aircraft that dont perform as advertised, NSA, endless wars, etc.) that it cant afford. Whats wrong with expecting the President to be fiscally prudent? Can someone give me a serious answer? All this party bashing doesnt float as a serious answer anymore. "
26886070300,Hes willing to shut the government down and possibly cause a crisis that would cause Americans and their families all sorts of money ...to try to keep them from paying too much on insurance premiums. edit - grammr
26886113939,The democrats are being little kids putting there fingers in their ears going lalala
26886121779,Hes kind of the the guy who says She made me rape her by dressing in those tight shorts...
26886160047,Here is the whole video on a a few sentences: John: I hate Obama Care it will devastate the healthcare business and that is why we have shut down the government. In every question asked about the government shutdown he just would answer blah blah blah Obama Care blah blah blah
26886165038,"Loses it? I just watched the whole thing, seems he seems cool as a cucumber (a cucumber who has developed a radio personality voice). Im no supporter of this man, but lets call a spade a spade: he was pretty collected and on-point through this whole interview."
26886170677,I hope that when this country sinks that some of the imbeciles who have supported this thug and his lackeys will finally acknowledge that republicans have had the goal of destroying this nation for the past 10 years and then some. Shame on those who have been fooled into supporting those tea party members and other poli-terrorists in the House. What an embarrassment to the entire legacy and history of this nation. Cant wait until the ship of fools that is the GOP/Tea Party express sinks to the bottom of the abyss. 
26886172676,LOL @ Loses It
26886175737,So what actually happens if the United States defaults on its debt?
26886181384,"Seriously people... this is such worthless nonsense. I agree Boehner is pathetic and laughably dishonest, but he didnt lose it - the title is misleading (it is the actual article title though). And the interview was ridiculous. The guy doing the interview was embarrassingly afraid to call Boehner on his absurd bullshit. It doesnt deserve any attention, nor does Politicsusa for trying make it even marginally interesting by adding a bullshit title."
26886183241,"where is the part where he loses it, or am i interrupting the circlejerk?"
26886192052,"I always wonder why nobody expose these liars on live television when they¡¯re claiming the Democrats refuse to have a conversation about this. They tried that 19 times, but the GOP refused. So why is Boehner not confronted with this bullshit and is allowed to repeat his lies over and over again?"
26886194402,"Boehner forgets whos really responsible for the overspending with his political reversals. It appears the Republican party is fully aware of the power of a government shutdown as a political negotiation weapon, as Boehner acknowledges himself, and states in no uncertain terms hes willing to give up nothing while blatantly LYING about what he cares about most. Its not averting default, instead he argues this logical fallacy about keeping to his principle about financial judiciousness while making NO concessions to raise taxes. Seriously, the guy is full of rehearsed political wharrgarbl. He doesnt seem capable of rational argument."
26886196243,Its okay for him though because people dont really care.
26886198354,Oh? Did Americas avatar for used car salesmen finally have a feeling?
26886200187,"This man is a complete sociopath. We need to make an example of him, and hold him for treason. More so than any other person held for treason in my lifetime (Im 30), I think this man deserves that accusation. He is possibly KILLING hundreds, if not thousands of people, because of his direct (and indirect) actions. If we do nothing to this man, politicians will continue to run this country into the ground. "
26886200509,"Honestly, Im pretty sure this is the end of John Boehners political career, or at the very least of his career as a major political player. He committed himself too fully to this tactic, and now that its going down in flames theres no way out. His party wont have any choice but to throw him under the bus and try to pretend it was entirely his fault."
26886205808,"fine, have the conversation. obama vs bohner, televised live in front of a studio audience."
26886207049,"Okay, I know what the expression loses it means in this context. But I cant help wondering what Boehner actually has that he could lose. Certainly not influence, respect, intelligence, or honesty."
26886217602,After watching this video I really think we should sit down and have a conversation. 
26886221364,Wow. He cant even answer a direct yes or no conversation with the words yes or no anywhere in his answer.
26886224429,He definitely doesnt lose it. 
26886224484,"Oh lord, were going to default arent we?"
26886228464,He says conversations 36 times. You know its just bullshit rhetoric when they just hover on one word. 
26886228488,"So is he saying that you always have the right to keep debating indefinitely while holding progress hostage, even though youve already lost the debate?"
26886232175,tl;dw: Sit down and have a conversation *100.
26886245760,Truly scary. This guy sounds like a desperate madman. And he is one of the most powerful people in one of the most powerful governments in the world.
26886257399,Bohner keep fighting the good fight my dude
26886268872,"As far as Im concerned, thats not losing it on TV, this conversation was actually more civilized than any politic discussion in Austria ever. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kLK69zmPGM&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player"
26886269766,someone should Indefinitely detain him for supporting al qaeda by creating a situation where the government is shut down. under AUMF 2001 and NDAA 2012 
26886279387,Seriously? You guys can see everything. 
26886280752,"What i dont understand is why, in the 5 years since we last raised the debt ceiling, does it come down to just before the new ceiling is met that we start to work on the problem? I know there are other issues to deal with on a day to day basis but if these people really had the best interest of american citizens at heart i cant believe that they would be so irresponsible as to wait till a couple days before catastrophy. Its just a game for these people, and everyone involved believes its the game that should change for them and not the other way around."
26886286629,If we played a drinking game where we took a shot every time he said the word conversation we would all win.
26886286781,I suddenly have a hankering for some good conversation.
26886287823,"lose it... had himself and angry little meltdown lost his temper Ok, all of that is pretty damn hyperbolic. He never came close to losing his temper. He was definitely visibly agitated at multiple points during the interview, but if the person who wrote this article thinks it was a meltdown, then I am wondering how many meltdowns he must witness in just a normal day. Poor guy - must suck to be him But seriously, I am pretty sure I lost my temper way more than Boehner did just by listening to the bullshit that he was spewing to George. What a frustrating interview. Im a reasonable guy my ass."
26886288709,Boehner is a lying sack of shit.
26886297672,"Too bad george didnt point out how happy the gop is they shut down the government. people arent stupid, they see what the gop did and they wont forget or I hope the Democrats wont let them forget. This is so much like all the tv and movies plots where the bad guy injures or kills a hostage and then blames the good guy. Its your fault I had to kill your family, you just wouldnt listen!."
26886301491,"Can someone please ELI5 who John Bohner is and what the background to this story Is? Im not from America, so Im not sure, but Im still intrested by politics in the US."
26886304750,The only thing he should be losing is his job... maybe citizenship. 
26886314964,"So, whats the deal here? If hes a liar and incompetent, how come he cant get fired?"
26886316796,"These isolated interviews are too easy for politicians to double-talk and use vague and misleading language to portray themselves as in-the-right If Obama and Boehner were interviewed side-by-side, they could call each other out directly, and at least then we would know that someone was blatantly lying, because its too easy for someone to say whatever they want about someone when that other person isnt there to counter their talking points."
26886325960,Good video. But spent 13 minutes waiting for him to lose it and.......it never happened.
26886326695,He didnt lose it. Sensational headline is sensational.
26886335279,"All he wants is a conversation? So, as soon as there is a conversation hell bring it to a vote? Thats easy enough. Somebody go talk to this man so we can end all this. He never said he wants to *do* anything, just have a conversation."
26886336819,"It¡¯s one thing to disagree with what should be funded based on ideology, morals or even your personal opinion it¡¯s entirely another thing to lie about it. John Boehner is either delusional incompetent or compulsive liar I wonder which it is."
26886337436,We should make a drinking game - take a shot at every mention of ObamaCare. Its like hes getting paid for every mention.
26886341857,"Can someone help me out here, how is he still in a position of power? Is this one man shutting down the country? I would be impressed he wields such power if it wasnt so crushingly sad."
26886344915,"This will probably get lost, but I encourage everyone to contact Speaker John Boehner (in addition to your Congressional representatives) and exercise your political voice. [You can fill out the contact form here.](http://www.speaker.gov/contact) This is my letter to the Speaker. It is a collage of some excellent and well-written comments from you all, interspersed with my own thoughts. Feel free to copy if you agree (or write your own if you dont agree) and are feeling lazy or just dont have a lot of spare time: *Speaker John Boehner, You want a conversation with the President for negotiation purposes. This is the list of things you want: 1. Cuts to Medicare. 2. Cuts to social security. 3. Cuts to Obamacare. 4. Cuts to a large number of other social programs. Heres the list of things youre willing to give up: 1. Nothing. This is not a negotiation. You dont want to have a conversation, you want to dictate terms. For a negotiation to take place there needs to be a certain amount of give and take. All I see is a list of demands. Do as I say or Ill burn down your house is not a negotiation tactic - its a threat. Some might even call it extortion. You have allowed time, energy and money on votes against the Affordable Care Act 42 times on any given day knowing you dont have the votes, yet cant quite seem to bring a vote to the floor to keep the nation running and not take the economy further down because you say we need to trust you that no one would vote for it. The GOP refused to negotiate on a budget for most of the year, and now put countless families out of income (which many probably cant fiscally survive) as a means to get their way on an issue that theyve lost on- that has already been voted and signed into LAW. Every other time a president negotiated during these crises it was never about undoing a law that the other side didnt like. Weve had the conversation and it didnt go the way Republicans wanted. That said, Republicans love to raise the Debt Ceiling when theyre in office. More specifically, it lists 18 increases to the debt ceiling between February 1981 and September 1987 under President Ronald Reagan. There were seven increases between January 2001 and January 2009 during George W. Bushs presidency. Now suddenly the party is against raising the Debt Ceiling? The absolute inconsistencies and outright lies that you are spouting are truly disturbing. It¡¯s all too easy to take away someone else¡¯s living when you still have a heavy wallet. This entire situation is a scam by "
26886350341,"If only obama would crawl to my office, show me his respect for the Office of the Speaker of the House and properly address me as Mr. Speaker, then we can begin to have a conversation. obama can start doing the business of the American public by repealing obamacare, repealing social security, repealing medicare, repealing all gun laws, quadruple military spending, institute the death penalty for gays, lesbians and even men who look kind of female, but you arent sure? I want them dead too. Then, when weve finally had that simple conversation, we can begin to negotiate on the resignations of Justice Breyer, Alito, Kagan and Sotomayer. We can begin to negotiate on restricting democratic seats to no more than 10 in the House and 1 in the Senate - after all I want your voices to be heard, but honestly, Id rather you all just shut up. Then, I want obama and Vice President Biden to resign. Now, I believe, through a quirk of the constitution, that someone would need to take over as President. I believe, if I remember my civics class that... gee, well I guess it would be me, wouldnt it. -- Speaker of the House"

26886588043,"The Republic plan, has been and always will be to, to deny any achievements to President Obama (not matter how small or large) in order to show that he was at the helm when the country went to shit. Then, the GOP can go back and point to history and say Look, that Black Democratic President was in charge when the country lost its credit rating, crashed the economy into recession, and defaulted on its debt. We werent in charge! Its all their fault. So, elect US and well make it better! All the while trying to re-write history to show that it wasnt them, the Republic GOP, Koch brothers, Limbaugh, Hannity, and Fox News that brought the country to its knees and took away health care for the most needy.

27087539842," What we do know is that a number of GOP have used government funds that were never approved. This was documented in 2011 when GOP house ways and means committee when on a witch hunt over the IRS status of AARP. There were serious questions about who actually funded that research as the head of the subcommittee agreed that the Subcommittee / Committee did. That should have gone to Ethics...did it? NOPE.

Issa wont be investigated. Not as long as the GOP controls the House...They protect each other. Now, I would wish that the Civil Authorities would reopen some of the investigations in Mr. Issa..maybe lean on a few people who know him well and get someone to turn States Evidence. Hes a crook! And while Mark Twain said the only native Criminal Class in America was Congress, I doubt he envisioned someone like Issa. Hes a disgrace to all Americans, even Republicans who look the other way."

26907578772,So do something about it Obama. Put some fuck it into your policy and go for it already.
26907754577,Agreed. But we could cut spending if the money were better managed anyway.
26907748050,"But there always seems to be money for the, NSA, CIA, FBI, DEA, and the military. Seriously much of that could be cut, starting with the DEA, which could practically be eliminated. Stop engaging in wars, stop spying needlessly spying on everyone, no more corporate welfare, just to name a few of the many ways the US government could balance it budget and provide services the citizens actually need."
26907645916,"As a former teacher that has worked in many bad schools, and some good ones, Im absolutely sick and tired of the its for the kids argument. The kids can go to hell. I dealt with so many terrible ones who just didnt give a damn about their free education. The ones in the middle class, WHITE, well-off areas were fantastic, respectful students. No problems there. The ones in the inner city were just awful. It has NOTHING to do with money spent on their food or education. They ate like kings and had everything the white school districts had. They just dont understand the value of an education. They dont understand what respect or morals are. And before anyone says this is because theyre poor and disadvantaged, the white and Asian poor kids never had any trouble behaving or doing their work. Many were, in terms of attitude, no different to their suburban counterparts. The African-American ones were terrible. No respect whatsoever. Couldnt care less about them. People keep making excuses for their shit, and Im tired of it. And before anyone calls me a racist that hates blacks, know that Im from the Caribbean and mixed with black. We value an education down there and dont behave like animals. Wed never let our students get away with this shit like Americas white liberals do."

26908054992,"I saw we bring all the troops home, slash the defense budget. And put that money into school. Invest in children, dont spend their future defending oil companies. "
26907797505,"We need to return to high standards of corporate responsibility and the end of government influence used to avoid this responsibility. Corporations are legal people you say? Fine they shall be held to high standards of personal responsibility like normal people. What does this mean? They should pay for the direct and indirect costs and consequences of their actions. For example: * If an industry relies on government guarantees and bailouts, they shall pay a supplementary tax to cover the costs of these guarantees and bailouts. * If an industry creates bubbles and push the bubbles risks to the government and the people they shall pay a supplementary tax for the cost of this risk. * If an industry relies on government soldiers to secure access to oil wells, they shall pay a supplementary tax that cover the price of the war enterprises. * If an industry destroys valuable resources, and the wealth of future generations, they shall pay for the damage they cause. The rule is simple: pay for the damage you have caused and regulate yourself so you don¡¯t cause this damage again. Once it is clear the externalities have been internalized, that the regulations prevent the dumping of costs on others, the supplementary taxes can be removed. This is not class warfare. We dont have anything against the legitimately rich that profit by creating value. We are only against those corporation who free ride the system, exploit its infrastructure, its government provided services, and through government influence avoid paying their fair share and dump their costs on everyone else. We will not be satisfied until, those who benefit from government largess and bailouts, pay for these benefits, and until the channels of influence they used to dump the costs on others are closed. "
26907430430,"¡°The problem is, is that the way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion dollars for the first 42 presidents -- number 43 added $4 trillion dollars by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion dollars of debt that we are going to have to pay back -- $30,000 for every man, woman and child. Thats irresponsible. Its unpatriotic.¡± ~ candidate Obama July 3, 2008. Dont be fooled."
26907502942,This is something I would expect a potential candidate to say about what the current administration is doing. Motherfucker has been the president for 5 years. Time to stop thinking out loud and having conversations with yourself and start acting like a president.

The government seems to have only two plans to improve education, more funding and more hours/days in school. Well, more money hasnt seemed to help, and many countries that outperform us spend LESS time in school per year than we already have. I never see any substantial changes put forth by the government.

26907986367,Obama said &lt;insert some common sense that all people want but it wont happen&gt;
26907611065,Can anyone explain to me or post a link where it shows that the government lost billions of dollars due to the shutdown? Is this in decreased economic benefits such as lost tax revenue?
26907455033,"We can afford to maintain 10 times the amount of debt we currently have. It is criminally stupid to cut spending when we could be borrowing at 0% interest. If the money spent this way is used for infrastructure or education, it will or should bring about economic growth far in excess of the debt incurred. As the economy grows, so does the ability of the government to handle even more debt. What is the point of having no debt as a government? No successful business would decline to borrow at 0% interest in order to expand their operations and profits. No homeowner with a job would turn down a mortgage at 0% interest if it meant they could send their kids to really good schools. Why should the government of the most powerful country on earth not borrow at 0% interest to make investments in the education of our countrys students? Even if we paid off the debt entirely, our government would be stupid to not immediately borrow more money. Remember, we take in 10 times the amount of money per month in revenue than we need to pay out in debt service. If you can pay the service on the debt, if you have 10 times the amount of money that it takes to pay the service on the debt, then the debt is not a problem. "
26907777763,"Even aside from all the shutdown nonsense, Forbes just came out with a report last week showing that the Obama administration is the lowest spending administration since Eisenhower.

26907494588,I know this is crazy... but why dont we cut military spending? Edit: there are good points for and against here.
26907501183,I dont want to hear about spending cuts either -unless it comes from defense. The middle class and the poor have been raped enough.

The avg cost per class of 25 kids nationwide is over $250,000 each year ($10k/student... as high as $30k in L.A. and D.C.), a clearly absurd cost that is 3x what it would likely cost if parents paid directly. Instead, the govt middleman overcharges us to implement a bureaucracy of administrators who micromanage everything.

26907586130,"Meanwhile, [we already spend more on education than any other country in the world](http://m.cbsnews.com/storysynopsis.rbml?pageType=world&amp;url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57590921/&amp;catid=57590921), yet education outcomes in our public schools are comparable to those in Eastern European countries. A lack of funding is not the problem. "
26907588923,...Spending money vs. Making money... Those two things arent the same
26907588984,"No where on the planet is more money spent on big government education with less to show for it. About all we get for the massive funding is an all-powerful teachers union creating crippling student loan debt in lieu of degrees. Its not like we are graduating well-educated citizens ready for gainful employment in a modern world. Rather, this education system spews out disaffected masses who are capable of little but voting for handouts. Clearly, if we look at the facts, the current government education system has failed the children and failed society. Giving this bloated system more money is not going to change this for the better."
26907589165,"Lets look at the score shall we. Bush inherited a yearly 300 billion dollar surplus and left us a 1.2 trillion dollar yearly deficit. A large part of that deficit caused by the tax cuts, which as late as [2006 we were projected to return to surplus as soon as ALL of the bush tax cuts expired.](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/aug/07/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-was-path-balanced-budget-when/)(we have a revenue problem not a spending one) So we come to the big first battle between Obama and the GOP. The GOP won 1.8 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years. 1.1 trillion from the sequester, another 600-700 billion in new budget cuts from Obama for free.(to the gop for free.. he didnt get nothing for that 600-700billion) Obama won the bush tax cuts which were supposed to expire 2 years prior, he got them to expire on the top 1%, or people making over 400k a year.......... IN A PAYCHECK. ok he [did roll back capital gains some.. which were also to expire on their own but this also for people making over 400k](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/1/increase-the-capital-gains-and-dividends-taxes-for/) which got Obama 600 billion out of 1.3 trillion in bush tax cuts.lets not forget Obama cut taxes further as part of the stim. and lets not really forget, these revenues that obama won were his already. He could have sat on his ass and vetoed anything that extended them and they all would have expired. Not saying that is a good idea in a shaky economy but **so far the GOP have won nearly 2 trillion in cuts, and obama won 600 billion in revenues that were already his.** ANd all of this to pay for the mess of the bush admin [which they didnt fund](http://www.pensitoreview.com/2009/12/29/hatch-deficit-spending-was-standard-practice-not-to-pay-for-things-under-bush-gop-congress/), as part of their [starve the beast program.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast). its like your boss getting you to agree to longer houses and you getting him to agree to cut your pay check in half. And your boss claiming both sides won something. One last thing, Im going to bold, If you look at how much Obama has cut the deficit and yes I understand that the will might not have been there in a diffferent world but **Had obama inherited a government with no deficit**, no surplus, no deficit, **we would be nearly 200 billion a year in surplus** Besides he REALLY sucks at negotiating, and the entire continue the NSA thing, he isnt that bad of a president."

26907590866,Lets spend our way out of the debt!
26907590989,"The [more we spend](http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/10facts/edlite-chart.html), the [more they fall behind](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/us-students-still-lag-beh_n_1695516.html)"
26907593564,"So Obamas pulling out the populism I see, making statements about spending cuts being unacceptable when he knows damn well therell need to be trimmings somewhere. Its a classic political ploy. Anyone on the Republican party with the gall to say lets try to keep this deficit down by cutting spending here and there will be lamblasted as being a crook. Normally Id be against unfair political plays like this, but its worth it to see the far right nuts squirm."
26907594898,"If this were said at the beginning of his first term, I might lend credence to it.....but after what weve seen in his time in office, I pretty much believe the exact opposite of what he says. He started out with so much support from a lot of Americans, but he really screwed the pooch. "
26907596161,"He sure is good at *saying* things, isnt he?"
26907600268,"Were about 400,000 teachers shy of where we would have been if it werent for The Great Disaster Capitalism Cataclysm. How about a jobs stimulus of 500,000 - 1,000,000 new education careers? Better bang for your buck, jobs-wise, than the military."
26907606567,Ah more words. Well thank you Mr.President you always say such great things.
26907610437,"Its about time he actually said this. Hey GOP **IDIOTS**, when you cut spending, you cut jobs. When you cut jobs, you slow down the economy. In other words, when you cut workers, say, at the DMV, they will no longer go to the gas station they were filling up from, each week, on the way to work. They wont go to the Dunkin Donuts for coffee. They wont buy their lunch from the local deli. They wont be buying new things for their home, clothes for their kids, so on and so forth. This affects small businesses TREMENDOUSLY. Those small business owners cannot afford to staff as many people, so they have to cut hours and jobs themselves. And, then those people cant buy gas and go to McDonalds, which then gets less money, and cuts jobs and... do you see now? In a poor economy, cutting costs, which cut jobs (aka Austerity) is the worst thing possible. You should cut when things are good, after reviving things completely. Stop playing the Im on the other team bullshit and start being part of reality. Note: I do recognize there is waste, but now is NOT the time. It grinds things to a halt to do it now, and drags out recoveries forever. You only cut back when times are good, since the surplus can be cut from. Ugh."
26907616650,"Uh.. how about we cant afford either?? The great propagandist strikes again... The great nation of imbeciles eats it up without a thought, as per usual. "
26907617871,"Yeah, okay Obama, okay. You save those children! As you watch education in the US fall apart."
26907620569,"Dont tell me we can afford to use drones to kill Pakistani kids, but we cant afford to invest in our kids."
26907622198,"Putting money in schools doesnt do jack shit. American education system isnt going to be saved by dumping money into random shit, but by spending it wisely on actual important subjects. For example, teachers will just stop giving a shit about students who dont want to learn and just waste everybodys time and money. Grade everybody the same with no leeways. I dont understand how nobody understands this still. "
26907624355,Why does it cost money to shut down the government?! 
26907627704,http://youtu.be/Qh2sWSVRrmo
26907628633,"Or we could keep military spending, and cut congressional pay, presidential pay, sell all the unnecessary shit the government doesnt need, like the NSA, then we all live happily ever after"
26907629830,"Well some spending has to be cut eventually,could we all agree on that?"
26907631149,The guy sure can talk the talk. Unfortunately he doesnt have such a great track record for walking the walk. 
26907631960,The sequester was Obamas idea. Funny how he is against it when asked and then baskes in the glory that the deficit is lower this year. But hey I got an idea lets cut the NSA.
26907632017,Whats with this guy and using our kids and the children to push his agenda? It really pisses me off - he did the same thing with the gun control.. protect the children.. keep our children safe.
26907634047,Obama says a lot if things. Im tired of his PR bullshit. 
26907634433,"Key word said this guy seems to say a lot of stuff, wheres the results? "
26907637162,Yeah Obamas right! Someone should do something about that! .. 
26907638099,"on the one hand, theres that old stereotype of the tax and spend liberals. On the other hand, we also have debt and spend big govt conservatives, and cut and dont spend small govt conservative/libertarians. And in the middle, you have other liberals and moderates who will do whatever is most likely to get them elected. Usually they elected by both cutting taxes and keeping welfare, which is an unhealthy long-term way to handle a welfare state. Personally, Id rather not destroy the whole welfare state. It works pretty well, but only when it is adequately funded. Right now it is not being funded enough because people look for loopholes (entire industries of corporate lawyers and accountants helping the rich find them), and there is incredible waste in a few key but well lobbied entitlements. Hope we can find a solution"
26907638122,When I read the top new posts in here I get a sense it could be anti Obama astroturfing by some nefarious group. Or are these opinions actually common in the states?
26907639465,I can hear Obamas pandering from here.
26907641879,If the public school system took 1% of the military budget we would have some of the best schools in the world and still have the most bloated military spending the world has ever seen.
26907643742,We cant afford either...
26907651571,"One day we will have to tell our grandkids what is was like being alive during the worst presidency ever, not because we brought it up, but because they heard about it in social studies."
26907655295,Where the hell was this Obama in 2008?
26907656923,Well thats just equivocating the word afford.
26907657731,"How about we cut spending ACROSS THE BOARD. Something drastic like 40%? Everything gets cut. Then, watch as politicians scramble to make it all work and pass a balanced budget. The sequestration worked because it was painful cuts, and guess what happened? Government agencies made tough choices and made it work."
26907663802,Obama says a lot of shit.
26907666231,"Unfortunately, POTUSs idea of investing in our kids is the Common Core Curriculum that puts billions of dollars into testing companies like Pearson while reducing the definition of learning to scoring well on multiple-choice tests. Common Core ostensibly prepares students for the workforce of the 21st century. I dont know about anyone else, but Ive never faced a life problem or a work problem that came with five choices: -one designed to trick me into picking it -one thats the opposite of what I should do -one thats flat-out wrong -one thats right -and one thats *more* right."
26907670054,"Actually Barack, we cant invest in our kids because you blew all the money on imperialism, militarism, regime change, drone strikes, NSA espionage, and bailing out the banksters. Just sayin"
26907671507,"Not that I am against investing in kids but I am getting tired of the constant faulty political bullshit put forth as some unassailable logical argument. Just because the government was shut down doesnt mean we could afford it, so using that logic to justify further spending is just stupid. &gt; Oh gee I had a medical emergency and had to put it on my credit card, I guess that means I can afford to buy these great new jeans I saw the other day!"
26907671618,Did he actually grow some balls during the shutdown?

26907677602,"Isnt it ironic how the Republicans are for smaller government, less taxes, and less bureaucracy, but when it comes to the military they want it as bloated and inefficient as possible?"
26907677803,"Thats like going out and blowing a bunch of money on beer and then saying dont tell me we cant buy school supplies when we just wasted a bunch of money on beer. We cant because we waste our money on illegal spying by the NSA ($50 billion / yr); wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and posturing near Korea; a completely broken healthcare system covered in paper mache thats already losing its gloss called Obamacare; bailing out banks; and $1 billion tax refund to GE (GE pays negative taxes each year). After all that waste, theres not a lot left over for the kids. In comparison, the Government shutdown was a very minor cost. Ironically, it was shut down to try and reduce some of that waste."
26907681568,I dont know how I feel pouring more money into a failing education system ran by admins that are mostly interested in securing funding.
26907681786,But the shut down was Obamas fault 
26907682644,"Doesnt matter, without a massive overhaul the dollar will collapse, and the American economy with it. That massive overhaul will never happen due to the bi-partisan monopoly."
26907683331,If one thing I learned about Obama in his years as president....he talks tough but doesnt act out on anything. Sold a dream but turned out to be just another puppet politician.
26907684473,The substance of this article is indirectly proportional to its upvotes. 
26907686732,*But think of the children!* Please. Thats the Appeal to Dead Puppies argument.
26907689085,"We do need budget cuts. But not for things like that. Top four spending things Medicare Medicade, defense, and social security. Cut from them "
26907689621,Many people dont believe that money spent on education or infrastructure is an investment. They see it only as money going out.
26907691876,the republicans really handed democrats a loaded gun on this one.
26907693969,hell still sign whatever bill they put in front of him
26907694875,"...as he continues to drone bomb the shit out of Pakistan, killing kids. Makes sense. "
26907696793,Politics as usual. 
26907698147,Why is this front page news? This is just rhetoric as usual.
26907711581,"Well... its the Executive Branch who decides to spend billions of dollars doing stupid crap during a shutdown, like putting up cones to block the view of Mt. Rushmore. All the Legislative does is delay non-essential spending."
26907711684,"Wait, shutting down the government costs the government money? Lolwut? "
26907714206,"Too bad those kids in Brooklyn cant do a fucking thing about it. Tell that shit to people in Congress or the Senate. Grandstanding isnt doing anything for anybody, and frankly, Im sick of your shit Obama. After this NSA crap, no more apologetics or justification for you. DO YOUR FUCKING JOB, and do it right."
26907717357,"This is coming from the same guy that stated, raising the debt ceiling doesnt raise our debt one cent. Then why call it the DEBT ceiling?"
26907718631,Im always surprised by the amount of people that truly believe giving the government MORE power is the solution to our problems. 
26907719456,"If you are $13 trillion in debt, you need to cut spending AND raise taxes. Obama is silly for refusing to cut spending."
26907719710,"You know what would resolve all our problems? Ceasing all job security for federal workers, raising wages for the productive and releasing the lazy and inefficient. "
26907722510,Anyone who believes in this statement clearly doesnt look at the big picture... Quotes likes these are all political games. 
26907724003,Whos he talking to? Himself? 
26907727052,That Obamas name? Albert Einstein.
26907728709,Hes right.
26907737475,"Obama, you are a principled guy, too bad our corporatocracy doesnt allow you to be president and never will allow anyone to truly run this country. I wonder what he really thinks about other things."
26907740962,Obama. Youre forcing the *KIDS* to invest in *YOU*. The money for Obamacare is coming from the millions of healthy young people who otherwise wouldnt need to buy insurance. Dont pretend like youre doing anything for *US*. 
26907741000,Who gives a fuck what he says. He never follows through.
26907754011,"Oh geez, get ready to bend over, when the politicians start trotting out schools and infrastructure youre going to get raped. For 5 years, Obama hasnt seemed to show any interest in education, but now that hes on the warpath to fight for more spending, this is where he goes, so that a bunch of soccer moms will fall in line behind spending on the other 95% of what he wants. It makes me sick. The TP should call his bluff, and offer to double the spending on schools if we halve spending on everything else, and watch his sudden interest in education slither away."
26907757489,"You cant balance the budget without either cutting spending, raising taxes, or both. Fortunately we are spending far too much on defense so cutting that would raise plenty of revenue without actually causing damage to national security the way an underfunded school system does systemically. Simple, though damaging if you profit from the military industrial machine (and who doesnt) We also live in a time when the most wealthy are party to generous tax allowances and offshore holdings loopholes, so all we have to do is bring those back to like half of what they were in the 50s (Estate tax anybody?). Pretty easy answers, if youre not solely concerned with politics and succumbing to your own emotions. Im so glad we have such well tempered leaders who place the proper practice of civics above politics."
26907758494,"Im confused, should I be happy or angry at Obama?"
26907759429,"So I have been to a couple different high schools in my life, and the school Im at now has the lowest funding in the state, but its also the most prestigious public school in the state. The schools around me are not nearly as good as mine but they receive a lot more money to which they spend it on iPads and laptops for every student.... Theres a lot more to it then this, but you need a lot of money to educate students. Its all determined on how much hard work they put in their classes, and they only need a good old fashioned text book to get the job dont. "
26907760617,"..uhm, I dont usually try to seek conspiracies, but my guts are telling me that this was staged in order to gain trust in Obama. I mean he said it before, something along the lines of a need to build up a trust among Americans in their government, and what better way to do it by touching an emotional subject like children and money. Politicians have to be strategists in the first place, because they are aware that every word they say can sway public opinion and masses, media included, can easily misinterpret information from them. This couldnt have come as something sudden to Obama, he mustve expected it, sure there is his personal opinion which probably is just and agrees to what he said here, but he clearly didnt say it blindly just because it is his opinion. But I might be wrong and even if I am not, I dont see anything wrong with this way of doing things, because no good politician can be a fully honest person with nothing to hide, he has to lead a country and no matter the goals, be it money, be it happiness of citizens, he cant be fully honest, he can only try to appear as a good politician or a bad one."
26907769467,"Seeing that the fed govmt spends an average of about $6 billion per day, Im unimpressed by Obamas comments. Thats an insanely large number and i dont see how thats sustainable over the long run. "
26907770178,Obama says a lot of things.
26907770492,"Then fucking do something god damnit! So much talk from both sides about we shouldnt do this, but we should do this! when in reality we know that there isnt a single 100% correct way of fixing this problem. I just want to see some initiative!! I know there are good Congressmen/women there right now who want to do something, so they should actually try!!"
26907770519,"Boo hoo, the kids are our future. Then why burden them with debt?"
26907773731,"Obama never wants to hear about cuts but wants more money, more money, more money for programs that do not work."
26907775022,Good thing we already have one of the highest public education costs per student in the world with some of the lowest test scores. Not sure more money is the solution. We arent going to be doing anyone any favors till we get rid of the teachers unions. 
26907777057,"Hes right, theres no way we should be firing anybody right now. You cant fix our biggest problem (unemployment) by making it worse. We should be spending more until people are back to work and the economy is growing again."
26907782666,"So, I thought that the point of the shutdown was that we were getting too close to the debt ceiling and we needed to slow down spending... How did shutting down cost us billions? "
26907783364,"yeah...perhaps it would be prudent for the obama administration to stop spending 3/4 of our budget on needless genocidal WARS then....oops, nobody is supposed to point that out, right? "
26907786092,I do all I can to negotiate with republicans I just dont listen to their point of view? What part of the shutdown cost billions? The BS with the national parks and monuments and lost taxes? I am pretty sure the GOP did not demand that guards be employed to make sure no one got into the national parks or monuments. If anything the democrats chose to shutdown the most public faces of the government to incite fear.
26907788404,"Yet we spend billions of dollars each year investing in Afghanistan, a country that offers us absolutely 0 value."
26907788941,The people watching fox news think Obama is the one that shut down the Government.
26907789647,"I find this very funny, because if a politician says we should cut a program they dont like it is because we cant afford it or dont need it, but if you want to cut funding of a program they do like it creates jobs. The truth is that all spending goes back to the economy in some way all with different ROI. Infrastructure spending, Education, R&amp;D all go back to the economy very well. Military spending has diminishing returns. Because if you spend 10 million on a bridge you now have a bridge and the jobs that build it. But if you spend 10 million on a bomb and blow up a bridge in another country, all you have is rubble, and the jobs to design and build the bomb. However most of that money goes to a giant corporation instead of construction workers who spend their paychecks almost immediately thus growing the economy. So at the end of the day you are left with corporations vs the people and rich vs poor. Considering who pulls the strings behind politicians on either side of the aisle actual change is almost impossible."
26907791815,"Fuck the Republicans for being partisan hacks but also, fuck Obama for being a partisan hack and a two faced hypocrite. This article is basically pandering by saying hes investing in children, so support him. Yeah right. His buddy Rahm in Chicago cut like like 50 inner city school and any new schools that get built are going to line someones pockets."
26907793957,"Im really tired of the kids card. HES PLAYING WITH YOUR EMOTIONS! More money does not equal better education, especially not with the terrible education programs like No Child Left Behind. If politicians really want to invest in kids then how about taking the financial burden of higher education off the shoulders of students."
26907797748,"nobody has to tell you anything, you are the president. &lt;- Obamas biggest problem"
26907797843,"well, obama, you have been in office long enough, maybe you could, i dunno, find a way to invest more in kids?"
26907799593,"I have no faith in that man anymore. He have broken and gone back on almost every single policy and promise. Fuck off, mr President...go somewhere else with your lies and broken promises!"
26907801535,"I just love the spin. Are you stupid, citizen? Shutting down non-essential services and cutting government waste *costs* money! The only way to save money is to spend more on government!! Raising taxes is good for you too, since Im only going to raise the other persons taxes!"
26907801758,"Until I see the national debt start decreasing, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss2hULhXf04"
26907803881,Do it for the children! You simply have to open your wallet when they say that ... right?
26907805319,Oh shut up Obama. So tired of this failed leader.
26907810464,We cant afford to shut down our government though. That kind of argument is not really valid.
26907812285,"No no no, dont give me this pointing the finger. Theyre all to blame. Dont tell me we can afford a war when we cant afford to invest in our kids, our health, and our prosperity. Thanks Obama."
26907814751,king obama should just fire up his money printer and just print all the money they lost during the shutdown. 
26907815656,Sham-wow can take his rhetoric elsewhere. The idiot shut down the Government to protect the greatest failed legislation in the history of our Nation. What a loser.
26907822651,i wish POTUS would say this to lawmakers instead of schoolchildren..
26907828115,double plus good double speak brother citizen
26907828760,"Disband the NSA,theres a good 20 million already a year."
26907832127,thanks obama
26907842242,I wouldnt characterize it as he doesnt want to hear about spending cuts. What happened is that the media got ahold of a soundbite where the president who was at a school expressed opposition to cutting spending for schools.
26907847403,I say we cut the military budget in half but with the stipulation that soldiers need to be safer and better paid then they already are. 
26907851596,"tl;dr: when you cut spending, you lay off government employees and stop contracts with private business. When you lose tax payers and consumers, deficits and debt increases"
26907852416,"I see this aa political move. I liked the President Obama I saw during the debate ceiling debate. That was a line I was fine with drawing. But I think some limited spending cuts in the right place is acceptable when tax increases are included as well. As far as spending cuts, I think the politics of it will demand that we do. That said, given the democrats control 2/3 of the Federal government, I expect we should see some tax increases with some spending cuts(a smaller amount of the later) Anyone serious about balancing the budget(or getting close to it) should have both spending cuts and tax increases on the table. One or the other isnt a practical solution. I lean towards one over the other, but I think of compromise of the two ideas is reasonable. (unlike defaulting, which was not ever an acceptable move)"
26907859892,I dont understand how this even got a single upvote. Is everyone here new to politics?
26907864704,Uh oh approval is going down better make some blanket statement about child education to get them back on my side. - Obama
26907865204,So not cutting spending is ok?
26907866042,spending cuts are necessary but NOT in education. obama is playing politician
26907870196,Funny that Senator Obama said something completely opposite. 
26907883834,***Why doesnt anybody think about the children!!??!!***
26907892363,Military spending should be cut. But it is. We need to overhaul healthcare. A universal healthcare system would solve nearly all budget problems.

26907895745,What kids? Certainly not the kids in the ghetto -- So white kids? 
26907897104,"When I hear Obama said I think back to Reagan hating on taxes then more than doubling them... Doesnt matter what they say, its what they do."
26907904957,Hmmmm... A politician telling a select group of people exactly what they want to hear to make them like him. God that is brilliant.
26907908960,Wouldnt shutting down the government save money since less people are working?
26907912173,"Reminds me of that movie about MC Hammer. He didnt want any budget cuts, either. But they happened, in the end."
26907922310,"Invest in our kids? We spend billions of dollars in education every year. What are you smoking, Mr. President?"
26907933140,Obama sounds more like Hitler every single day. Everything I do is for the protection of the kids.
26907937514,"This sort of comment is why I said a few weeks ago that BOTH sides truly were to blame for the shutdown and almost default: Obama is essentially saying hes not willing to negotiate... whether you agree with his stance or not (and I for one very much do agree with him when were talking about education) you have to realize that the attitude hes presenting is one that will lead to roadblocks to getting things done. Granted, it wont be the ONLY reason, but that only matters in retrospect when history judges, not so much when youre living through the problems. "
26907945422,Whenever I hear a politician talk about kids I assume they are up to something. What? You dont support alpaca farming subsidies? Do you hate children?
26907946556,Ummmmmmmmmmm....How does shutting down the government cost it billions of dollars? Theyre still taking in tax dollars and not paying salaries at the same time. Seems like it saves money.
26907951392,"Im for education, but I feel giving schools wireless Internet isnt needed. "
26907953394,"Question: I am in my 40s and have been hearing for decades that we need to invest more money into our schools. But after we keep spending more and more, the kids scholastic achievements keep declining? ELI5 how more money is the solution. "
26907957511,So why doesnt he invest in children?? Hes been there long enough. 
26907964601,Its about time he pulled out a couple stops.
26907967960,"Hah, Ive first read &gt; Obama says he doesnt want to hear about *spying* cuts."
26907979273,"That is good that he brings that up. Shutting down the government again in January/February when Republicans get their next shot at a hostage crisis, is going to get that up amount up again, too. $49 billion here, $49 billion there, pretty soon youre talking real money."
26907981702,where is all this extra money going to come from? we need a balanced budget.
26907981753,"The government faces no solvency or financial constraints. As long as Obama and his followers pay obeisance to the balanced budget gods, they will never be able to fight Republicans on this."
26907984278,yea because its for the kids guys! 
26907984841,Reminds me of this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOh-rpvjYg&amp;feature=youtube_gdata

26908028166,"/r/circlejerk , tired of your shit reddit."
26908060901,But they spend billions upon billions spying on our citizens and allies. Our government is so fucked
26908066358,we NEED to cut spending. we also NEED to invest more into our futures and we NEED to increase the intake of government funds. why is it we can never talk about everything? its always talk about A and C while B and D are off the table? I want to see us talk about the entirety of the government budget and agencies with FUCKING EVERYTHING on the table! this shit pissed me off how we go from democrats wanting to increase spending and tweak the tax code a bit and we have republicans wanting to cut taxes and decrease spending. what more infuriating is looking at the end results of each parties wants and seeing they both do the same fucking shit.
26908076023,Obama blaming everyone but himself as always. Do liberals ever accept personal responsibility? Of course not.
26908077826,Obama kinda sucks now.
26908086054,I dont like to hear about the fact that I dont have money to spend... but that doesnt mean I can just keep spending.

I am part of a minority as well (not race) and my group is also not represented by % that matches the population of the country. Also, we have the most diverse congress in history. I have a cousin that is white and he grew up in a very poor neighborhood in the city and most of his neighbors are black. From birth to graduation of high school, he had the EXACT same opportunities as his neighbors (which arent great). My cousin didnt get special treatment to get into college but his neighbors could, all because of the color of their skin.

26780477362,"Im always so mystified by people who make such absurd assumptions about affirmative action and racism. 1. Affirmative action is not a free job or a free admission to a college. Race and gender are considerations and businesses are encouraged to take affirmative action to remedy their past discrimination with inclusion with programs largely of their own design. 2. The majority of the recipients of affirmative action are [white women.]( http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/17/affirmative-action-has-helped-white-women-more-than-anyone/) 3. There is and always has been affirmative action for white males; its called legacy admissions. [Interesting, no?](http://www.businessinsider.com/legacy-kids-have-an-admissions-advantage-2013-6) 4. The notion that the US is a meritocracy absent affirmative action displays supreme ignorance about discrimination throughout history and in the present. 5. Besides the fact that Income based admissions would ignore non income related hardships specific groups face with regard to college admissions; there is a critical difference between wealth and income. In 2003, blacks had about 10% of the wealth that whites have and it has only gotten worse since the crash. [See?](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/24/donna-brazile/brazile-said-53-percent-black-wealth-has-disappear/) 6. The notion that black people are more racist in an environment in which they have an extraordinary limited amount of political power and influence over the white majority is embarrassing and indicative of a refusal to acknowledge power in discussions of racism. White people have it. Black people do not. Large swaths of black people may be prejudiced, but prejudiced aint racist. "

26980283548,Sorry for jumping to conclusions. But my question was an honest one. 
26782106627,"Thats a bad article and a misleading number. For one, that wasnt given to him when he left Halliburton -- thats all the money he earned working as CEO of Halliburton. It was spread out over five years (at least for the stock options and such, which are designed to be paid out at a later date.) I dont think its unreasonable to assume that a CEO of a large corporation could earn $5-6 million per year in stock options. /r/politics has stories all the time about how the average compensation of the top 100 CEOs is over $15 million per year. Im sure much of these things (such as the stock options) were decided when he signed on with the company -- long before he was chosen as Bushs running mate. Things like his salary and deferred compensation *definitely* have nothing to do with him leaving. &gt; Many of the other categories were subject to some calculation and/or negotiation Where does Politifact get its information that these were negotiated bonuses given to Cheney when he left his CEO position? It seems much more likely that Cheney had these stock options as part of his original contract -- half a decade before he ran for Vice President. To be honest, Im not a huge fan of Politifact. They tend to not be as unbiased as FactCheck.org. Theyre not terrible, but this article is an example of where theyre not too great. Implying that things like deferred compensation are an exit bonus is just plain wrong. Their entire calculation rests on this assumption, yet they provide no evidence or even reasoning behind this assumption:"
26781570350,"Fact check: **FALSE.** Dick Cheney did *NOT* profit handsomely and directly from the Iraq war. Before he entered office, he assigned all of his stock options to charity and purchased an insurance policy to guarantee his deferred compensation. He didnt stand to gain or lose *a single penny* based on Haliburtons performance. Not one cent. http://www.factcheck.org/kerry_ad_falsely_accuses_cheney_on_halliburton.html &gt;**Summary** &gt;A Kerry ad implies Cheney has a financial interest in Halliburton and is profiting from the companys contracts in Iraq. The fact is, Cheney doesnt gain a penny from Halliburtons contracts, and almost certainly wont lose even if Halliburton goes bankrupt. - - &gt;**Stock Options** &gt;That still would leave the possibility that Cheney could profit from his Halliburton stock options if the companys stock rises in value. However, Cheney and his wife Lynne have assigned any future profits from their stock options in Halliburton and several other companies to charity. And were not just taking the Cheneys word for this -- we asked for a copy of the legal agreement they signed, which we post here publicly for the first time. &gt;The Gift Trust Agreement the Cheneys signed two days before he took office turns over power of attorney to a trust administrator to sell the options at some future time and to give the after-tax profits to three charities. The agreement specifies that 40% will go to the University of Wyoming (Cheneys home state), 40% will go to George Washington Universitys medical faculty to be used for tax-exempt charitable purposes, and 20% will go to Capital Partners for Education, a charity that provides financial aid for low-income students in Washington, DC to attend private and religious schools. &gt;The agreement states that it is irrevocable and may not be terminated, waived or amended, so the Cheneys cant take back their options later."
26781603022,"The only thing I could find on that is a bunch of sites (actually, leftist sites) saying that Cheneys lawyer says Cheney wont seek any tax benefits from his donation. I have no reason to doubt that, since he also went out of his way to purchase an insurance policy out of his own pocket so that even if Halliburton went bankrupt he wouldnt stand to lose anything. Plus, its worth noting, none of this was legally required of Cheney. He did it on his own. Its not like he was just following protocol; he went above and beyond (costing him tens of thousands for the insurance policy and millions in potential profits) to remove his ties to a number of large businesses (not just Halliburton)."
26781675151,"So it looks like he didnt stand to lose anything if Halliburton failed, but he sure was able to gain the satisfaction of helping those he wanted at the expense if those he didnt."
26781622019,"So, why not just sell those options? It also leaves open the possibility that, while not profiting personally, he was doing favours for friends within Halliburton. Those could have been friends to whom he already owed favours or people from whom he expected or hoped to receive some return favours in kind later. Im willing to be proved wrong but the extensive use of no-bid, cost-plus contracts looks a hell of a lot like a vehicle for corruption and Ive yet to see an explanation for them that makes better sense than that thats what they were."
26781665586,But he did get $34 million when he left Halliburton. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/24/chris-matthews/chris-matthews-says-cheney-got-34-million-payday-h/
26781579911,"Wow! I was wrong! Does his charitable giving have an impact on his taxes? If the value of his options go up, does he get more tax benefit? Anyway, I wont be repeating that again, since I consider Fact Check to be a reputable source. Thank you for correcting me."

Your government artificially deflates the apparent cost of gas by a tremendous amount, thats a big part of why fuel is so much less expensive over there than most of the rest of the world. We wont pay an extra cent, the cost will be passed to you. This is not a tax break for us, it was a tax break for you and everyone you know who purchases our product. We *want* to give you what you seek for the price youre able to pay, but we have a fiduciary duty to generate a specific profit and assure you that this change will not affect that final figure for our stockholders."
27092947847,Effective Translation: Obama wants you to pay more for gas.

27092948291,"Stopping oil companies from getting tax breaks seems as likely as North Korea launching nukes and becoming Emperor of the Universe as a result.

27092949071,"Personally, I think the oil companies should be nationalized...and their executives arrested for corruption and bribery, and all their assets seized.

27092950989,of course he does. right after he stops NSA from spying on us all.

Although, Obama could certainly put pressure on parties involved. He hasnt done that, and I think this is telling. Politicians have been known to say things that appeal to their base without being substantive or truthful in nature (shocking, I know)."
27092955526,Gas prices are going to skyrocket I guarantee it
27092956001,"Oil companies will simply raise their prices because they will feel the need to sustain a certain level of profit. Look at big universities with endowments, they could charge less, but lower profits shows weakness. "
27092957049,This might as well say Obama wants to give everyone free ice cream. It doesnt matter what Obama wants. The rest if the government enriching themselves on bribes from the oil companies wont let this fly.

27092964153,"This is just his way of looking like a hero. Nothing will come of this, I guarantee it."
27092964244,Must be an election year. 
27092964926,Wants. 
27092965044,Wants to... 
27092965211,"I support eliminating most or all of the preferential tax breaks for oil companies, if only to help new renewable technologies that are disadvantaged because dirty technologies get to damage the environment for free, but everyone needs to understand that in the short run, this does not hurt oil companies, this only hurts consumers. Almost the entire incidence of higher taxes on oil companies will be passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices, rather than being absorbed by the energy companies as lower profits. This is because tax incidence depends on the Price Elasticity of Demand. Price Elasticity of Demand is the economics term to describe how consumers change their purchasing quantity in response to a change in price. In other words, with most products as price goes up you would expect consumers to forgo the product, use less of it, and/or find alternatives, so quantity demanded would go down. In goods with very comparable alternatives, if price went up you would expect quantity demanded to fall off a cliff. For example, if the price of yellow onions starts to go up you would expect people to switch their purchasing to white onions because theyre not so much different that people are always willing to pay a huge premium for a yellow onion over a white. Energy like gasoline is the opposite of yellow onions: demand is almost completely inelastic in the short run. As price goes up, people still have to keep buying roughly the same amount. They can try to avoid driving to some degree, they can try carpooling, but in the end they have to get to work, drive their kids to school, run errands, do everything else, and theres nothing they can really do in the near term about fuel costs. Maybe in 5 years they can buy a new car that prioritizes fuel economy. So with gasoline, because demand is inelastic, the vast majority of the tax increases are borne by the end consumer. Oil companies will continue to be as profitable as ever. This is in the short run. After implementing a policy of higher taxes on energy we would expect people in the market for new cars to immediately begin placing higher priority on better fuel economy, and as they shop for houses to pick ones closer to their work and maybe with public transport options, etc. In the long run demand elasticity can increase, but that can take 10+ years as people have to wait until its time to buy new cars and move houses."
27092965817,"this is a really shit article. i mean, really shit."

27092988067,At the same time they need to eliminate tax breaks for churches/ religions.

27092995738,churches too.. make churches pay taxes!
27092996799,They will just pass it on to the consumer. Gas prices are already rising.
27092996984,Good idea I want to pay more for my gas.
27092997376,The reason this wont pass is because he wants to take that money and specifically earmark it for alternative energy companies. I really dont think we can afford another $500 million toilet flush like Solyndra.

27093006009,Election year move to motivate the Democratic base. No chance of passing - will anger anyone who remembers Solyndra and will lead to gas price (and overall commodity price) increases in the short term if passed. Political poison.

Its ridiculous and long over due. I doubt it will happen though, as they funnel more money and influence to politicians than anyone else of the 99% can muster though. "
27093016995,Can we stop with the roundabout terminology? Why not: Obama wants to tax oil companies again.

27093022801,"Yeah, Im conservative and even I dont think they deserve tax breaks. Go ahead Obama. You have my permission."
27093022973,"I know everyone here gets a raging hard on when they hear that tax cuts to big corporations might be repealed. But the problem is that big corporations dont get to be big corporations by simply accepting lower revenues. Do you think oil companies would just say Well shit. Were not going to make as much money this year!? ...because that wouldnt happen. They would just find somewhere else to make it up. And know OIL companies in particular, their favorite method is to pass it on to the consumer +20%. So in other words, if it costs the oil company 30 more cents per gallon, they just raise the price of gas by 30 cents + another 20% because now they can hang it around the governments neck. They will feed into the narrative that these hippy liberals and their green initiatives are killing the economy. But the bottom line is the same. We the consumers will get fucked. Thats probably why they never go through with these cuts."
27093023074,"Heres the thing... No matter what tax is being implemented, somebody is going to disagree. There are three basic tax methods: progressive, regressive, and flat. Lower/Middle class usually favor progressive taxes because the more money earned, the higher the tax percentage. Regressive taxes tend to be favored by the richer as taxes percentages, you guessed it, regress as they earn more money. Flat tax is like sales tax, a percentage thats not based on class. Looking at income taxes overall (its been a while), the top 10% is paying ~70% of all the money collected and is earning ~40% of all money. Take that for what its worth... Thats all Im sayin"
27093024522,eliminate tax breaks means were going to raise taxes on everyone to try to fix this when in fact it will stay the same and we will pay more.
27093025116,Take it from the oil company and give it to renewable energy. Time to stop helping the rich to get richer and start to think about the future.

27093032024,"Im fine with rolling back corporate tax breaks, but doing so only for one industry seems a little underhanded. Better to eliminate corporate traces, and raise taxes on individuals. Salaries go up, and equality does to if you raise the top rates much higher. Also, all investment income gets treated as regular income."
27093032227,Theres a difference between wants to and will.
27093032457,"I wish I got these tax breaks, my tax rate is 39.6% and I have to pay both myself and my wifes SS tax up until 115k then medicare for 3% and a new $10,000 bonus tax for Obamacare ON TOP of the 10K I already pay for healthcare for my family. wtf? small businesses should get these breaks not these shitheads."
27093032922,"Im not a big fan of corporate welfare, but it depends. Some tax breaks are incentives to do things they wouldnt do otherwise, and are not horrible. Lumping all tax breaks into one category isnt really accurate. Anyone know what the actual percentage profit is? Exxon is a gigantic company, so a 1% profit is a lot of money in absolute terms, but not much in percentage. And these oil companies are mostly publicly traded, are they not? So that profit is partially going out to a lot of normal peoples pension plans, retirement accounts, stuff like that. But that said, giving free money to a big company for no particular reason other than that they lobbied for it is certainly NOT good government."
27093033983,Wants to and will are two different things. 
27093034327,"I work for a major integrated oil company that had about $250 billion in annual revenue last year, with $27 billion in income and $17 billion in taxes paid. Thanks about a 43% effective tax rate or over $47 million in taxes paid every single day. And Obama wants us to pay more taxes?!"
27093034965,"Remember ladies and gentleman, shit rolls down hill. "
27093035169,"Late getting in this post, but here goes. This makes a good headline but does not tell the whole story. You would have to look at each tax break to see if it is simply to benefit the oil company. Take the marginal well tax break for example. Without the tax break, it might be unprofitable to operate that well. The government has decided that marginal wells are important to keep producing and thus provide the tax break to encourage oil companies to keep those wells producing. Otherwise, the oil company would abandon and plug the well. Once abandoned and plugged, you simply do not flip a switch to start the well producing again. So, there is some justification and good policy reasons for the tax breaks. I am not saying that all oil tax breaks should be kept, but you cannot make a blanket statement that they should be eliminated in full."

27093063383,I read this as Obama wants more Lobbyist Money from the Oil Industry
27093064224,"I mean, if you tax big companies, wont they just push those prices onto the consumer?"
27093064874,"There arent any specific oil company tax breaks. You would have to remove the tax breaks from the entire industry (energy producers), not just the guys you dont like. Since there are hundreds of small oil companies, it will wipe out a lot of small business."
27093068901,What would it take for something like this to pass?
27093070082,spoiler alert: he wont 
27093070848,Finally a policy of Obamas that I can agree with. Oil companies should not have tax breaks. They pollute our planet and reap massive profits every year.
27093072498,These types of things sound great in theory on the surface
27093073576,how about we stop invading the middle east and giving no bid contracts to oil drillers?
27093073634,Bullshit. Obamas just too much of a pussy to veto any bill that doesnt come with these tax breaks nullified. He could easily pass the blame of the resulting fallout on to those that wont cut these tax breaks. Hes just playing the crowd by pretending to want to cut these tax breaks. Hed probably shit his pants and veto it if the tax breaks were actually somehow magically cut.
27093073657,"This again? Please. We did this in california. Guess what happened? Our shitty legislature changed it to a tax at the pump instead, and all our fucking gas prices went up. Fuck this political rhetoric. Want real change? Stop voting for these fucking morons and start voting libertarian. I dont care if it wont work, lets try it."
27093076377,In other news: The sun is hot.
27093077970,He looks like hes covered in oil. Also racist: they will tar and feather him Ty
27093079344,So Obama wants to restrict oil companies from subtracting expenses from their revenue when calculating profit? How is this fair?
27093080035,"lol right he wants to eliminate tax breaks for the very same oil companies which he gave carte blanche to begin offshore drilling mere weeks before the deep water horizon incident. he wants to, but (wait for it lol) those evil old republicans!? just wont let him lol the kayfabe is getting rather thin and shopworn after 5 years or so"
27093081082,Bet they raise prices that same day.
27093081172,"Obama says he wants to do a lot of things , talking about it and doing it are completely different "
27093081670,"I know reddit is all against any big business at all, but wont this have negative effects? More taxes mean less profits, and Id assume it would lead to higher gas prices. "
27093082252,"yeah, good luck with that..."
27093082968,*steps on soapbox and grabs mic* WELCOMMMMMMME ......... TO THE LAST TWO YEARS!!!!
27093082997,"There shouldnt be any tax breaks for profitable companies. Exxon, Apple, GE, BP, you name them. Once youre off the ground and running, the tax breaks should go away. "
27093083807,Well its about fucking time.
27093084220,I cant see this happening. Its the president who takes corporate donations for campaigns versus the oil and gas companies. 
27093085497,what a nice gesture.... now DO something for once.
27093088542,If we eliminated from one we should eliminate them from all. Their should be no governmental advantages given to certain businesses. 
27093089331,But in a few years everyone realizes there is more tax breaks than ever. 
27093090237,Then just fucking do it...tired of hearing about it year after year.
27093092801,"What would that really do, though? The oil companies would only raise prices to makeup for the tax breaks and taxpayers would be stuck with higher gas and heating expenses. We lose either way. (Jesus, Im pessimistic)"
27093095005,"let me know when it happens, kthxbye"
27093095283,"Thanks, Obama."
27093096501,President Obama *wants* to do a lot of things...
27093096732,People in hell want ice water.
27093096805,Like congress would ever let that happen....lmao!
27093099746,I see an executive order coming that will shake gas prices

27093110317,"You know, at the county level we expect tax breaks to expire eventually. The longest is ten years. How long has the oil industry been getting incentives? "
27093113284,So our gas will become more expensive? No thanks. Its not like they are going to go; higher taxes? Well just eat the cost. Theyll pass the cost onto the consumer to make up for the increased cost of doing business. 
27093115849,"Ill take Things That Are Not Going to Happen for $1000, Alex."
27093116655,GOOD! Now add on eliminating the tax breaks for Unions and married people and well be making actual progress. 
27093116972,"and I want to eat a fart out of Natalie Portmans asshole, but its probably not gonna happen"
27093121660,There goes gas prices.
27093122346,"We already subsidized the theft of $15T of oil in Iraq to the tune of nearly 4,500 American lives and an estimated long-term taxpayer cost of between $2T and $4T. What more do these guys want? The sun, moon, and stars? "
27093124290,Isnt a little ironic being that oil and gas are subsidized or own by the government in communist states. Then we have the biggest so called socialist dictator in human history trying to cut off said subsidies. 
27093126175,Socialist! /s
27093126393,Should be a no brainer. 
27093127739,sweet now we know if it goes thru then they will just forward the taxes onto the end consumer
27093133710,Get ready for higher gas prices if this goes through
27093135074,"Until there is a real sustainable alternative to fossil fuels he should be trying to keep the cost of petroleum products as low as possible. I thought energy independance was one of his priorities. I realize that tax breaks mainly go into executive pockets but raising taxes will not come out of those pockets, it will come out of consumers at which point we will begin to look again to foreign oil."
27093135570,Good idea fuck oil companies
27093136031,What is the *real* justification for the breaks? 
27093137430,Im curious. If the breaks actually end up that they are subsidies--and their elimination means our gas prices will rise by say a buck a gallon--is everyone still against these oil company tax breaks?
27093137565,Can I get a tax break?
27093141115,This headline could be from 2007...
27093143031,And Obama has said a lot that he failed to follow through on or actually fight for after claiming to want to do something.
27093146830,Great thatll just raise the cost of gasoline...
27093147982,wants
27093154170,Probably isnt serious. Midterms are coming up. This seems like a political move so republicans have to come down on the unpopular side of an issue. Pretty standard stuff.
27093154858,Take all those tax breaks and give more to FARMERS.
27093155177,Yes.
27093156947,"He wants to.... He wants to do a lot of things, but never actually does them. The guy is all talk."
27093158115,"If he does do that, I hope he doubles up on Secret Service spending...lot of people who profit from oil are gonna be just a tad angry about it..."
27093158362,Its about time. Big government shouldnt pick winners and losers.
27093163923,"So they should be eliminated. Same for Canada btw. But the US Congress is run by big oil and we will never see it happen. I doubt we will ever see it happen in Canada as well. Yet politicians will cut things to the poor like food stamps etc After all it is a sin to remove subsidies to Big Oil. This just shows the US is a corportist state aka fascist and not a capitalist one, as with capitalism they would get nothing and sink and swim on their own instead of money from tax payers they do not need...(anywhere in the world really)"
27093164318,"They would never let him, but lets support Obama on this."
27093164469,And the consumer will pick up the tab.
27093164576,"Yay, higher gasoline prices! "
27093165036,"These articles are constantly posted without any reference to what EXACTLY the subsidies/tax breaks are. Is Obama talking about some very slight tax incentives to keep marginal wells producing? If those tax incentives were removed, that would force the premature closure of thousands of wells. Something that could billions in lost tax revenue. Is he talking about LIHEAP, the program that pays for heating oil for poor families? Is he talking about advanced depreciation schedules that authorize oil companies to depreciate the capital value of the well ahead a bit faster than the actual production cycle. An accounting trick that doesnt actually cost the government any tax money over the long term. Taxes deferred now are paid later."
27093169175,Everyone should pay taxes. Companies should most definitely NOT get tax breaks. I cant even imagine just how twisted this way of politics is worked out.
27093169397,Yeah not gonna happen. Face it Obama is a lame duck.
27093169494,YESSSSSSSSSSSSS please
27093171228,THEY DO MAKE RECORD PROFITS EVERY YEAR!
27093174010,Of course this stands no chance of passing. Not even worth talking about. There is no way it would ever make it through congress.
27093175695,Does it really matter if these companies get tax breaks or not? If they pay more taxes it will just go to our defense spending. Very little to nothing would go to where its actually needed.
27093184425,"Yeah, Im guess he wants to eliminate these tax breaks the same way wanted the public the option. That is to say, he doesnt, he just wants to appear to be less conservative than the Republicans."
27093185205,What Obama wants and what he does are two very different things. 
27093188516,Obama wanted/wants to do a lot of things. 
27093190125,Why not just seize the oil companies and make them state owned ? Like what Chavez did in Venezuela. 
27093190592,why doesnt he make a flat tax and eliminate all tax breaks?
27093190762,"Id love to see a list of things Obama has *wanted* to do in his presidency, and what hes actually accomplished."
27093190904,Where did this Obama come from? Maybe these last two years he will go out with a bang. 
27093191786,Yeah that isnt going to happen. This is more or less Obama trying to win favor with the public.
27093193827,"Good fucking luck, Mr. President. "
27093197950,Part of me wants a giant increase in taxes for oil companies just so people learn about rudimentary economics. Similar to hoping your annoying anti-vac friend gets measles. 
27093199917,Good luck. They have been trying to get rid of this tax break since the 1960s.
27093201687,This will happen. /s
27093205556,Kennedy tried this in 1963. It did not end well.
27093205578,What will Obama do once the oil companies raise the prices on consumers to make up for their lack of tax breaks?
27093216009,"Yeah, and the pope is Catholic. "
27093216549,[Good luck.](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01727/BP_1727184c.jpg) 
27093217440,"You would have to be stupid to not think that they are going to make up the difference by charging us more. In effect, the government is going to get more of our money while oil companies wont be affected all that much."
27093221071,"Wish in one hand, shit in the other. I wonder which will fill up faster?"
27093222714,Im curious as to what is being called a subsidy. I cant find anything specific on it. Are they allowing them to write certain expenses off or just flat out lowering rates? Edit: Found something interesting about your 4B$/yr subsides. http://www.forbes.com/sites/energysource/2012/04/25/the-surprising-reason-that-oil-subsidies-persist-even-liberals-love-them/
27093222988,Raise your hand if you want to pay more for your gas directly or indirectly.
27093224780,Hes actually been trying to do this for years but it gets blocked by congress every time. 
27093226033,How about religious tax breaks too?
27093227152,So that gas will be 8.50 a gallon...
27093229183,Thats good for him that he wants to. But from the looks of it hes got the same chance of doing it as I do.
27093231113,I WANT to win a million dollars to.
27093235801,I WILL NOT STAND FOR CENSORSHIP. FREE SPEECH IS DEAD ON REDDIT.
27093239511,Lololol just like how Obama wanted to bring the troops home and stop raiding legal cannabis dispensaries that pay their taxes fair and square. 
27093240079,Make it so!!
27093244304,"Wont they just put it back onto us anyway? Well foot the bill to make up for it, right?"
27093244953,another obama gimmick ... trying to ride on popular issues to get what he wants then turns completely around ... remember gitmo? ... typical sleazy politician ... its part of his ongoing campaign to salvage his rotting reputation 
27093247257,These kinds of things dont work because the companies just charge more for their product. When will we learn? 
27093247995,who is this and what has he done with barry o
27093249473,"Hes wanted to do this since he was elected. A lot of politicians want this¡­ no one does anything. Ive been hearing talk of eliminating tax breaks for big oil companies for over a decade¡­ but thats it, just talk of wanting to."
27093249674,and this will get through the house how? anyways you know this is coming this is why you pay 5 a gallon for gas under obama when it was only A dollar under bush in December 2008

27093258838,"Or, said another way, Obama wants to prevent oil companies from taking many of the same deductions that other companies get to take."
27093266208,Right. And unicorns will fly out of my ass and cure cancer. 
27093266540,At this point Im not impressed by anything he wants to do. More action less talk.
27093269795,Daily Reminder that Gitmo is still open and multiple of Obamas goals are unrealised.
27093274832,Do you honestly think a company is not going to pass this new cost down to the consumer? Say hello to gas price hikes. 
27093275153,He promised this in 2008. It was one of the main reasons I voted for him. Hes just NOW getting around to talking about it. I wont hold my breath.
27093275781,"Obama can want all he wants, its not going to happen. "
27093276558,Well then DO IT! Stop going on and on and say I want to remove this and this and this and be specific.
27093284460,HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAA
27093285152,I want my flying pig to wash the dishes.
27093287605,A lot of this tax subsidy goes towards making it economic to keep stripper wells online. These are wells that only produce a few barrels of oil a year and would otherwise be money losers to operate. There are however many tens of thousands of these wells and if they all went offline it would reduce our domestic production and would be more oil we would have to buy from overseas.
27093288187,I want to be the queen of england.
27093288282,What he says and what he actually wants done are two completely different things.
27093288614,"Whatever he says hes going to do, he does the opposite."

27093293510,Good. Fuck taxes. 
27093295743,Never gonna happen.
27093298987,"This is such a strawman. The companies that actually pay the most taxes (in real dollars, not percentages) are oil companies. You can argue whether they need tax breaks or not, but to be intellectually honest that discussion should be about corporate tax policy as a whole. Not singling out political winners and losers. The biggest beneficiary of oil companies is already the Federal government. The receive billions in revenue from oil companies and billions more from gas taxes. Its not the private sector (or free individuals) fault they cannot effectively spend their money."

27093317207,"When companies get hit with heavier taxes, dont they just pass it along to the consumer by raising the sale price to make up for the difference? [Serious]"

27093336396,"Oh thats a good joke, thanks for the comic relief! "
27093337505,"If this even were to go into effect, wouldnt it subsequently give oil companies more incentive to charge more per barrel, inevitably causing an influx of the price of everything we use? Im talking about hypotheticals, based on hypotheticals, based on hypotheticals, based on hypotheticals, but is far too possible."

27093364037,"Obama wants to do a lot of things, the problem is he never accomplishes anything and when he does its a disastrous clusterfuck. "
27093366562,Thats cute. He thinks well believe itll happen.
27093370075,The carbon bubble is getting bigger day by day. 
27093370108,Just like Guantanamo and policies that violate civil rights. Yes we can!
27093370603,"Great, well at least it will only have a detrimental affect on those who buy gasoline."
27093378864,Sure he does.
27093381639,I would be concerned for his safety if there was any chance that would pass. Those people are powerful and they dont like it when you mess with the trough.

27093476173,"In the unlikely event that this were to happen, wouldnt that mean gas prices severely going up for all of us? Because those oil companies will want to make their big profits anyway and since they wont be getting the tax breaks they will just hike up the gas prices and get their profits from us regular people who dont get any say in the matter. "
27093479557,Well looks like gas prices will go up
27093485554,"Good luck! You try every year, and it goes nowhere. Taking money from businesses and spending it on actual human beings will never work here."
27093492413,"Yeah, and I want a billion dollars, but it isnt going to happen. Wanting something doesnt equal getting through congress."
27093499964,If he really did then it would only mean REALLY higher prices for the rest of us at the pump. Companies never eat added expenses of doing business. They pass that cost on to the consumer.

26709859272,"Well l, I make just over 40k a year and pay roughly $5500 premium for a family plan with a deductible of $2000 per person or $4000 max before the insurance really kicks in. The premium comes out pretax so it is probably not an exact comparison, but I would much rather pay the higher tax to get the free care as even with insurance you cant always afford the visit to the doctors. Even when the insurance kicks in, you still have out of pocket costs"
26709896967,I pay $220 a month for zero prescription drug coverage and basically only emergency coverage. 
26709870276,"The NHS **isnt** funded through NI. NI was created to build up entitlement to *pensions* not *healthcare*. The NHS is funded from general taxation. Still. You know. You had ... er... numbers We are still cheaper by far than the US - and with universal coverage and free-at-the-point-of-access. But - for example - I have a chronic condition for which, on the NHS, I can only get the 2nd-best class of drugs that slow down the progress of my being crippled and that will prevent me from dying *quite* as prematurely, rather than the very best and newer class of drugs that can reverse the progress of my particular disease, because the NHS under the guidelines of NICE will not fund them. And, by the way, since Ive had to have some significant dealings with the NHS, dating from about 6 years ago, Ive been misprescribed lethal drugs on 3 occasions by 2 different doctors, lied to about a letter sent from my consultant to my GP (my GP claimed hed never received it), and had to put up with the most astonishingly patronising, rude GP receptionists you could possibly imagine. I thought the people who moaned about the NHS were, you know, *moaners.* There is a real, significant problem with the understanding of service provision in the NHS - and severe over-staffing in the hospital department I have to attend monthly. And their computer system is so crap it couldnt manage to book an annual consultant appointment *one year in advance.* And I once caught my consultants registrar looking up my condition on Wikipedia. So...not all sweetness and light over here. Better than over there though, on the whole."
26709882884,"&gt;The NHS isnt funded through NI. It is partially. I dont know the full breakdown so you are right to criticise. Plus, NI includes pensions so is it approximately representative as a comparison? I dont know. If you have better data please let me know and Ill update the original comment. I am very sorry that you have a chronic condition, but as I said the NHS isnt perfect. Ive had friends and family treated via the NHS for very severe conditions for long periods of time (talking years here) and only have good things to say about the hospitals, staff and service they receive so of course it varies. If you read through the other responses Im getting I think youll come to the same conclusion *Better than over there though, on the whole.*. My main point of the original comment was that a nationalised system is more effective and a more compassionate way to care for a population.. and one that is cheaper overall too. I hope NICE funds the newer class of drugs and wish for you good health."
26709840779,Thank you for the interesting breakdown. Youve brought up how healthcare is funded but is it enough to actually pay for your countries health?
26710286853,"I fall into the last bracket (or beyond or whatever), and I pay about $1500 a year for my (cheapest possible) healthcare, with my employer paying for the other half. I still have to pay co-pays and 10% up to $9,000. If I got the family plan, now its more like $3,600 (plus co-pays and all the rest)."
26709954176,"Ill tell you what... Public health care saved my life. Literally! The car wreck I was in completely destroyed my face. Jaw broken in 4 places and my left eye orbital crushed into pieces. I was in a coma for a week and had 20 hours of reconstructive surgery. In the States I can only imagine what it would have cost me but I suspect it would have been in the seven figure range. (I guarantee you I wouldnt have been able to afford personal medical insurance at the time of the accident). A month in the hospital, follow up appointments, incredible rebuild on my face...all done and paid for BEFORE I sued the car Insurence provider (which by the way is another public Insurence provider. My monthly car Insurence is $95 a month). Colour me Canadian. Socialism does work. "
26709968896,"Another point to bear in mind is that the US government pays out about the same amount per capita for health care (via Medicare, Medicaid etc.) as the UK government does"
26709826001,&gt;were paying for it out the ass. Thats the exact phrase that prompted me to write the above post on the other article comments...
26709845393,"Some quick links attesting to this fact: [BBC article, lil old now](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10375877) [Telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8877412/NHS-among-best-health-care-systems-in-the-world.html#mm_hash) [Global ranking, UK no. 18, USA 37](http://thepatientfactor.com/canadian-health-care-information/world-health-organizations-ranking-of-the-worlds-health-systems/) Not the best sourcing, but I believe that nationalised systems consistently rank higher than the USA."
26709865887,"I personally pay a few hundred dollars more than the figure you listed. That excludes the portion my employer pays (about 60-70% of the entire amount per month), and the many deductibles/shared costs (20% of each procedure) that add to this. Ive been part of a socialized healthcare system and there is nothing in the US now that I would miss if I had to go to another socialized system."
26710618628,"as american who is completely for nationalized health care, i dont get it either. All the british and canadian people ive talked to loved it. the only arguments americans have had is about wait times :/"
26709726354,"Opponents of rational health care systems here tend to ignore the fact that, if we used a sensible system like the one in the UK, their increased tax burden would be more than offset by the elimination of insurance deductions from their paycheck. Considering the amount of money my employer spends on their side of insurance payments, one would think the American business community would be rampaging up and down the halls of Congress flaying legislators who opposed a tax based system."
26710002648,"My wife &amp; I have fancy health insurance through her employer. I believe that it is capped at $3500.00 as the maximum that we would have as out of pocket expenses per year. This is on top of the cost of the insurance policy (I have no idea how much this is). Unlike the NHS this does not include dentistry (covered under separate insurance), which is really expensive. Ive used both the UK NHS and private health care here and much prefer the NHS. Here in the US healthcare is like someone is trying to make money off your misfortune. In the UK healthcare is someone is helping you to be healthy."
26709871067,"My company has a pretty generous plan. I dont pay anything in premiums and the most I would have to pay out of pocket is $3000. Based on your figures above, Id be paying nearly $6000 in health tax. For me, the UK plan would cost me a lot more especially since I usually dont come anywhere close to $3000 in expenditures each year."
26710007509,"It should also be pointed out that the Bismark System used ion the rest of Europe isnt actual government health care, but is universal and could be more easily adapted to the US. "
26709721178,"In a discussion in another post, I made this comment (and still waiting for an answer) in regards to socialist healthcare systems being too expensive. I am curious to how this compares to what you guys in the US are currently paying: ________________________________________________________ See, here [UK] the NHS is funded by National Insurance (NI) contributions (which are effectively a tax on your income). So, using this [tax calculator](http://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php) Ive put in the contributions per year based on different salaries: * ?10k p/a (~$15.5k) - NI = ?269.40 / $417.29 * ?20k p/a (~$30.98k) - NI = ?1469.40 / $2274.79 * ?30k p/a (~$46.47k) - NI = ?2669.40 / $4131.64 * ?40k p/a (~$61.92k) - NI = ?3869.40 / $5988.21 * ?50k p/a (~$77.85k) - NI = ?4214.40 / $6562.24 How does that compare to your insurance? Before you answer, bear in mind that if you dont work, or are a kid you STILL get full coverage. Lose your job in a recession, still covered. Wife has a kid and no longer works, still covered. Also, when you need a prescription, it costs ~?8.40 (~$13.00) no matter on how much you have or how expensive the drugs. Dont get me wrong, the UK is expensive, we are taxed more than you guys and Im sure our system couldnt translate directly to yours (even if the vested commercial interests magically disappeared), but.. is our socialist healthcare really more expensive here? NI also goes towards the state pension Edit: Added ?50k **Edit 2:** Via /u/umbama who pointed out that NI doesnt fund the NHS. It does partially fund the NHS (as far as Im aware but this is also in dispute) with the rest coming from taxation. Thus, it is extremely difficult to get a full breakdown. However, [cost-per-head can be a good measure](http://www.nhshistory.net/parlymoney.pdf) (warning PDF). The UK cph is ~?2000 ($3116) whereas the US is closer to ?5000 ($7790). It should also be noted that we pay more in general taxation here in the UK than the US as well. So, read the above figures as EXTREMELY ball-park. However, the overwhelming response Im getting is that the US system is expensive (more than we pay even with the disputed figures above), it hinders freedom by making moving between jobs extremely difficult due to coverage and leads to people living with treatable illnesses until they are unbearable. The NHS isnt perfect and other countries have more effective systems, but one thing Im seeing is that a profit incentive for health is NOT a good idea."
26709869224,&gt;Ive been part of a socialized healthcare system and there is nothing in the US now that I would miss if I had to go to another socialized system. Pretty damning indictment of the US system right there..
26709828518,"&gt;Im not sure it really compares Well.. both pay for healthcare, albeit in very different ways. By showing the cost of one system Americans can compare how much they are paying. &gt;I cant even understand why Republicans support it Im sure this isnt limited to just Republicans; vested interest in insurance providers, pharma etc. a way to enslave the poor to jobs and suppress pay.. etc. etc. Edit: from chicofaraby above: *Absolutely. And many many prescriptions are simply not covered. And no, insurance is not portable for working people. It stays with the employers. That leverage over employees is why the business community doesnt complain.*"
26709970855,I thought the US actually ended up paying out more? Partially because we save by paying early i.e. prevention and single-buyer pharmaceutical benefits?
26710337760,"More than what I pay for myself and my wife, but my employer is contributing roughly $10 for every $1 I pay. Also, my mandatory state retirement thing is 3x as much per paycheck so, if adding that would be appropriate because NI includes the state pension, Im paying about 20% more."
26709769450,"&gt;(even if the vested commercial interests magically disappeared), but.. is our socialist healthcare really more expensive here? The answer is a solid NO. &gt;?30k p/a (~$46.47k) - NI = ?2669.40 / $4131.64 &gt;?40k p/a (~$61.92k) - NI = ?3869.40 / $5988.21 I live in NY and make between the two amounts above. My insurance costs $8601.12."
26709922978,"No, but a LOT of TV coverage and talking heads saying it wouldnt..."
26709922273,It isnt more expensive that is a right wing myth. Universal healthcare is 1/3 to 2/3 cheaper than the U.S. and there has never been evidence provided that America is some how different and that this wouldnt work.
26709859296,"That any American who isnt extensively rich can argue that their healthcare system works, or is fair or is better than a more socialist one simply shows the power of propaganda, people will actively support something that harms them, it seems the word socialism is a scary one to many to the point where common sense and decency doesnt matter any more, of course people should make profit off the ill and injured, how could that ever backfire?!"
26709874465,"From the responses Im getting it really seems that even if you pay less for your premium, the other costs will ultimately end up in you paying more."
26709908606,"Efficiencies of scale. The UK has one payer the US system has many. That means that there is duplicate staff, equipment, faculties in the US. A system like the US system will cost more unless there is some major corruption in the UK. "
26709772274,Thanks for the info! Does your insurance also have an excess where you have to pay the first x-amount of each visit too? (As I seem to recall that being mentioned somewhere).
26709819699,[deleted]
26709867580,"A very good point, do you have any statistics relating to this? Also, it seems that most of the cost goes to insurers or over-priced drugs, do you have any idea as to the breakdown of where the funding comes from i.e. directly from govt funds or via the higher premiums people pay? "
26709806772,"Im not sure it really compares, as National Insurance covers our healthcare and pension (as you mention) as well as unemployment benefits, and sickness and disability benefits. The US system seems absolutely crazy to me. I cant even understand why Republicans support it. It is extremely anti-business, as it discourages people from moving jobs or from trying to start their own business, if they are worried about losing health care....and it is criminally expensive. "
26710392675,"I see a ton of complaining here about American health care costs and how the numbers you have would be better, etc. Im an American with American health insurance. I pay $110 every month in Florida out of pocket, with no help from my work. I have a $2000 or $2500 out of pocket max with that and a $200 deductible. If it wasnt explained to you, if I caught the doom plague, and was sent to the hospital, Id be responsible for $200 on my own, then I believe 40% of the bill up to $2000. If my treatment cost $2M, I would still pay $2000 and thats it. In all the years that Ive been alive, only once did I have problems where the doctors couldnt figure out why my knee gave out. Since it works still, and it has no problems, not really an issue. In the year and a half that Ive dealt with a public health care system in Australia, all I can suggest is -fuck that-. Wife has nothing but trouble with the free care. Sure its free, but alas, the doctor spends at best 10 minutes with you and sends you on your way. (They do this even if you pay them out of pocket instead.) Heaps of time waiting to see doctors for answers that dont come. I do, however, like the cost of XRays and CTs. Those are affordable without insurance. In the long run, Id rather be at home, paying a cap of $2k a year and getting doctors I want who seem to want to solve problems than ones who say, well we dont know, maybe come back in 6 weeks with your possible broken hand and well look again then, oh you are fussing about a splint, I guess we can make one for you. TL;DR dealt with both, Id rather have home. Did anyone ever check to see if they could get insurance from some place else that fits their needs and is more cost effective than an employers?"
26709737912,"&gt;*their increased tax burden would be more than offset by the elimination of insurance deductions from their paycheck* This was my point, I feel like Im missing something when I debate Americans on healthcare - or maybe not communicating my original one well enough. The convo usually gets mired in rights and socialism-bashing, which I frankly dont understand. If you arent averse to answering this I would be grateful for a reply; how does my original post compare to what you pay (a simple more or less is enough, no need to talk about salaries on reddit :-)."
26710836201,"Australia is even simpler it is a 1.5% levy on income for Medicare (our public universal system), with an additional 1% if you dont have private insurance and earn over AUD$70k/year, and there are exclusions for low income earners. Public basically covers doctor visits, tests, hospital and drug costs, private covers additional dental, optical and optional extras. Private cover is pretty cheap since it is an additional coverage to Medicare, not a complete plan, a young single individual is like $15/week, it is not the same as US private plans."
26709936051,"Since all the replies mention company plans where the employer pays part of the cost, I thought Id mention what Im looking at paying. I say looking at because my wife and I are currently uninsured and have been for a while now. Im a grad student and make about $19K a year. She just finished her masters and is working through a temp agency until she can find something in her field and has a base pay of about $37k (overtime brings in more). That puts us just under $60K/year total before taxes. My wife has been doing the searching, so I will give you the information as I remember what she has told me. We are looking at an individual (ie. not through a group or employer) plan that covers both of us. The best quote weve found so far comes out to approximately $260/month ($3120/year). For that amount we get a fairly high deductible (I think it was $7500/person/year) with a 20% copay once the deductible is met. I believe well person visits are free once per year, but any other visit (including due to illness) are $35 per visit. Any emergency care, x-ray, or lab test are payed out of pocket until deductible is met. Bottom line, if you stay healthy and only have to do a yearly well check up... then it is less expensive. If you ever get sick, injured, and/or have to have any lab work... then it will add up very quickly and cost a lot more. edit: I should note that while the 1 well vist a year is free, any lab work that is done will cost you. So, the blood work to check your cholesterol that the doctor always does... usually well over $100."
26709986865,"There are concerns about quality and waiting times for National Care systems. In the US, Cancer survival rates are much better than they are in the UK. You might not expect that to be true with all those uninsured people in the US, but it is. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-136377/US-v-UK-The-breast-cancer-survival-stakes.html http://www.pop.org/content/cancer-survival-rates-far-worse-great-britain-us Not a simple issue(more in the links) but the fact that the uninsured in the US have a better breast cancer survival rate than those covered in the UK does make you do a double take: http://www.factcheck.org/2009/08/cancer-rates-and-unjustified-conclusions/ "
26710028401,"The drop between insured and uninsured is significant though. I wonder if US stats include people that are just too broke to go to the doctor and die off the books? Also, dont quote the dailymail, they are not a reputable source, to say the least!"
26709861296,"Non-US citizens dont seem to realize that if/when the US gets Universal Healthcare their costs will no longer be subsidized by the US. The US pays the largest share in R&amp;D, all these national health systems only pay prices on manufacturing, not R&amp;D and Marketing."
27069774551,"&gt; Youre probably young and male, and your insurance costs are low because youre exceptionally low risk. Not everyone gets those rates. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that if youre older, youre more risky to insure. So they cant go to the damn doctor until its too late and get ultra expensive conditions that were left alone too long. Now, if an old person got regular check ups wed all be far better off. The cheapest way to lower health care costs is obviously prevention. Dont encourage people to sit there until its a massive and costly problem. Let people go to the doctor whenever the hell they want. "
27069998963,"&gt; the cheapest way to lower health care costs is obviously prevention. [Probably not](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money-it-doesnt/) &gt; The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall, CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive. &gt; ¡­ a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs.

He also said that no one is going to take it away from you. As is now clear to everyone, the ACA can not deliver on these promises. The insurance companies can take it away. If they changed the plan the ACA may **require** that they take it away. Employers can take it away. Obamas promises were clearly unrealistic. As you pointed out, insurance companies cancel policies every year. How on earth could Obama make these promises when it only takes a little thought to see that they cant be kept? "
26932269442,"&gt;This is just an effort to shift the blame from Obama to the insurance companies. What? Obama isnt to blame to begin with, any plan created before the ACA was signed is grandfathered.

I think it is foolish for anyone to write Christie off, but I also think it is foolish for anyone to presume his success. I also think you can safely swap Christie with just about any 2016 potential nominee in the prior sentence. Dont forget, not even a year ago, Rubio was seen as a GOP front runner. Now it looks like he probably wont even be able to justify trying. &gt; Check the recent polls. Christie, a governor who doesnt get a whole lot of exposure outside of the northeast, [...] He was all over the political headlines everywhere after his reelection, he immediately became the GOP magical cure-all, practically overnight. Yes, HRC has near-universal name recognition, but Christie already has some of the highest of the potential GOP field for 2016. However, theres a big difference between in the recognition of each candidate: voter knowledge of them. While more people know about HRC, far, far, far more people have an idea of her political positions. For most people, theyll know of Christie, theyll know of his great political popularity in NJ despite the political tide there being against him, but they wont really know his positions: hes an ideal blank canvas for undecided voters to paint their hopes on. That wont last through a primary season, let alone a general election. Plus, Id never put any serious stock in presidential polls this far in advance. Christie is the frontrunner for the GOP -- but only today. [At this point in the 2008 primary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates), Obama had only been mentioned as a poll option *once*. &gt; [...] plus he puts NJ and maybe even NY into play Put NJ in play? Eh, maybe. In a strategic sense, not likely, though possible -- certainly not guaranteed. In a media sense, itll force both sides to contest the state no matter what, just for appearances sake. New York, however? Hahaha, not a chance. Youd almost be more likely to see HRC flip Arkansas back to blue ([which I wouldnt bet a nickel on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012#Votes_by_states)). Home states matter a lot less in modern presidential politics, especially when ideological identities are flipped between candidate and state. Perfect example: MA moved closer to Obama in 2012, relative to the rest of the nation, despite Romney being from there. &gt; Probably not the black vote like Obama, though. Any democratic nominee in 2016 will have one of the best surrogates for the black vote: the first black president, Barrack Obama. Beyond that, [blacks have been a hugely safe and reliable constituency for democrats as far back as FDR](http://origin.factcheck.org/Images/image/2008/ask_factcheck_images/april2008/BlackVote/Black_Vote_Pres.jpg). Barring a sudden racial political scandal in between now and election day 2016, the democratic candidate will win black voters by overwhelming margins, with 80% probably being the floor of support. Again, not saying that any victory is preordained or even that Id feel confident predicting one way or the other right now. But a lot of the logic youre using for your argument in support of Christie v HRC doesnt really make sense."

And this is all before Christie puts his political machine into motion and starts campaigning nationwide. If you think Clinton has this wrapped up in a nice little bow, you are a moron. Clinton will get the women and minority vote like every Democrat. Probably not the black vote like Obama, though. Christie has access to money. He is close friends with that Zuckerberg guy, you know from the Facebook thingy, plus he is from one of the wealthiest states int he country, and well loved there. And if you dont think Christie can look presidential, you need to look at the videos of him after hurriane sandy. He is far more presidential than I have ever seen Obama. He has gravitas (no, not a fat joke) and a n nonsense way of speaking that just works. He destroyed Buono, a very liberal woman, in the last election. I hope he runs because while I dont agree with him on everything, he would be much much better than another Democrat running us into the ground like Obama."

The proof is in the pudding. Dems run higher deficits that Reps. They should both be flogged publicly. I would rather them not use misdirection to say they cut $6B here over 10 years while increasing spending $20B over there. And I would like them to not say they cut spending when all they do is decrease the amount the budget was set to grow. Your metric says nothing about the size and scope of government. If all those workers were working for free, I wouldnt care how many of them there are. Like I said, size does not refer JUST to the number of people employed by the government. Yeah, the war on drugs. Nixon, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, Bush II, and Obama. Dont pretend democrats dont fight the war on drugs. How about the war on guns, the war on poverty, the war on privacy. How about the NDAA, indefinite detention, drone war, kill lists. Those are all things Obama has not only continued, but expanded and fought for. Republicans wanted to remove indefinite detention a couple years ago and Obama had his lobbyists lobby for them to put it back in or else he wouldnt sign it.

Please stop throwing around the lie that Clinton created a surplus. He didnt. It was all an illusion. http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/ even if we remove Social Security from the equation, there was a surplus of $1.9 billion in fiscal 1999 and $86.4 billion in fiscal 2000. under accrual accounting the government would book immediately the costs of promises made to pay future benefits to government workers and Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries. But even under accrual accounting, the annual reports showed surpluses of $69.2 billion in fiscal 1998, $76.9 billion in fiscal 1999, and $46 billion for fiscal year 2000. So even if the government had been using that form of accounting the deficit would have been erased for those three years.

That happened day one when the tea party clown car pulled into town and took the house.

27103009477,could anyone be against this? does anyone thinks it is ok to ask the government for assistance while using drugs. that would mean the tax payers are paying for the drugs.
27102870980,"I would support this if some conditions were met. The first is that after being kicked off welfare, they get the option to go to rehab, and upon completion, they are allowed to receive welfare again (if they qualify). The second is that marijuana and alcohol are treated equally. The third is that even if caught with hardcore drugs, there is a two strike policy before being kicked off of welfare. The people addicted to drugs do not deserve to be treated like criminals. No one wants to be addicted to meth or heroin and live so impoverished that they need welfare. No one wants to just get by on welfare. They chose to use drugs in the beginning, but eventually the drugs control them. And who are we to deny someone a joint or some alcohol every other day? People on welfare deserve to have some sort of fun (not sure what to call it) because what quality of life would they have if other people mandated what they spend that money on?"
27103494351,That will cost more than it ...saves? 
27103207621,"Why stop at welfare recipients? Why not do this to all government employees? But seriously, the people who come up with these ideas just want to attack these programs. There is no benefit to doing this."
27102856649,"So many questions come out of this. 1. What happens to the kids who are no longer getting food? How is this helping them? 2. Is there any proof that testing is actually going to incentivize people to stop taking drugs? 3. The $4,700 savings is only the money not given to the people kicked out of the program. These people are going to have to turn to other services to get food, or at the worst, they turn to crime, which quickly eats into that savings. "

But government assistance is not something to live on forever. Its to help people get on their feet and go to work. Drugs are not supposed to be in your budget!

27102675810,I agree I get drug tested at work. They even shave large patches of hair from our arms and legs. If I have to deal with this to earn money then they can deal with pissing in a cup. Im not against welfare but if I have to follow the law to get paid so should everyone else
27102733535,"I live in Michigan and I had to be drug tested before I got my minimum wage job. In theory I think this is a good idea because dhs is in a sense paying you whether it be snap, cash benefits, etc. My thought would be that if you test clean, you should be able to be employable, and the state shouldnt have to be a crutch for you to lean on because you are a drug addict. Edit: Phone posted the beginning and hit enter and I couldnt finish the thought. "
27102741078,"Finally this is brilliant, as a resident of flint nothing makes me more angry then seeing families with brand new clothes and a chrysler 300 paying for their food with food stamps. I hope this eliminates some of the abuse in the system"
27102762266,"Aside from the fact that this was struck down from florida... Why is this bad? I mean maybe Im an asshole.. but like others have said.. I had to take a wiz test to change oil for $9 an hour or whatever. I had to take a drug test to valet cars. If I wanted to work for the government Id probably need to take a wiz test. I would say charging them with a crime or then searching their homes based on the results is wrong. But if they are receiving public assistance they should follow the same rules that job seekers need to follow. Edit: In response to some other comments that were in the thread... Right I dont need to submit to a test to get hired, but in most cases most national companies, or places that I want to work at usually require it. Its not LAW to have this happen for your job. On the flipside you also dont need to apply for welfare / benefits if you dont want to. "
27102776518,"Ok lets try this one again. HURR HURR.. its against our rights to be tested and illegally searched to receive benefits. Its my right to do illegal drugs all day and receive public assistance from the taxes paid by folks that in all likely-hood had to get drug tested to get that job to pay into the taxes so that benefits can be paid. THis is a different topic.. but Ive always felt that those who are without jobs and who are receiving public benefits (barring those with kids that need to be taken care of or disabilities) should be providing community service.. Working in soup kitchens, Helping keep the parks clean etc.. do something, gain skills etc to end the assistance, or at least benefit the community thats helping you. edit: feel free to downvote this opposing opinion into oblivion."
27102792477,"Before I start, let me say that I thoroughly enjoy my recreational drugs and am not some crazy fundamentalist. That said- I think you should be tested for any free handouts (welfare/food stamps/unemployment). If you have so little money that you cant afford to eat or raise your kids, but somehow have money to buy coke, something is messed up there- not to mention that drug use definitely isnt conducive to bettering your situation/getting a job/etc. I also think that the recipient should routinely have to justify ongoing help. How many jobs did you apply for this month? Did you make any effort to educate yourself? Were you not able to find any side jobs in the classifieds while looking for a full-time job? I grew up in a low-income household, but we had pride. Living off of handouts full-time was absolutely not even an option. Taking a job scraping shit off the side of a toilet was less demeaning than living off someone else. Yet now, it seems to be the norm to just expect the government to pay your way through life. To those spouting 4th amendment, that is not the case at all. No one is pulling you out of your house, drug testing you, and then punishing you. Youre asking for free money because of the situation you put yourself in (there are exceptions, but 90% are self-inflicted consequences) and then complaining that you dont get money because there are opiates in your system... I am all about charity, and a government supporting its citizens in need, but when you see the same beggar on the same corner for six months- youve given him money several times, yet every time you see him, he has a bottle of wine in his hand.. you know where your money is going. why keep contributing until he has proven that hes clean and truly wanting to make himself something better? If you ignore this and keep donating out of some blind sense of charity, youre not doing one ounce of good. edit: TIL there are niggers on reddit. not black, but with the same mentality. downvote the guy suggesting that someone goes out and works for a living instead of sponging of the government."
27102822610,"I mean, I smoked and I agree with this proposal. If you Truly need welfare money, you shouldnt be spending your money on weed. Especially if you live in an illegal/bible belt state and you are paying something like $20 a gram. Im looking at you Georgia!!!"
27102973583,"I live in Michigan, this needs to pass. If you are on welfare you have no business buying drugs. Im disabled from the Army and dont even get welfare because of the stigma of being grouped in with these people."
27103005155,"No, Florida did random testing which resulted in expensive tests (price inflated for government contract) administered to clean recipients. Only testing on suspicion increases the odds of catching dirty recipients and more than covers the costs of testing. Again the debate over this. Why should we fund someones habit? Why should children go hungry because the money was spent on drugs? The argument that they are probably too poor to buy drugs is ridiculous. Truly. I work directly with this. If you dont think drugs, sex, alcohol and tobacco are are obtained at a childs expense, you need to get out on the streets and see for yourself. If you believe the welfare system doesnt need a complete overhaul, you shouldnt voice your uneducated/uninformed opinion. If you believe the children will suffer more if we cut the welfare you obviously dont understand they are suffering NOW. I support restriction on available products, no cash system, mandatory sterilization, mandatory termination of high risk or ANY pregnancy conceived after the start of welfare, and mandatory government work programs for the able (and 90% will be able in some form or another). Downvote me to hell, but Ill see all you bleeding hearts there very soon. "

27103105065,Good
27103248311,"No offense to the people against this but there are plenty of people abusing the system, and this is the start of catching them. I do agree that after identifying the problem, in this case drugs, there should be another step to help get that person self sufficient. That being said, we dont need more parasites riding the free money whale because they realized getting knocked up a couple times would net them a free pay check."
26739230410,Whatever Costco pays which is *easily* double. 
26739286826,"Well only one person actually gave a number so Ill reply to you. You are saying a person with almost no skills doing a job designed for teenagers should earn 30k a year yet the starting salary for a teacher in Florida is 35k, with and avg of 45k. Thus are we saying as a society a teenagers job running a register at Walmart is virtually the same in terms to the pay of a teacher, a person who spent 4 years in college who is tasked with teaching kids? Im going to assume you will say teachers should earn more, thus a starting salary for a teacher would be what? Then we now must adjust all the way down the line commensurate with their experience. Teachers with 20 years in will be at 200k under your scale. "
26739391915,"Its probably time we stopped talking about wages per se, and started talking about a guaranteed basic income. The sorts of jobs that pay minimum wage are rapidly dwindling."

26739452027,No. Your assumptions are wrong. Just because you can get a min wage job at 16 doesnt mean there are 16-20 year olds at every position. 
26739086518,"Minimum of $15/hour, 2 weeks paid vacation, health care, 5 sick days, and 100% match on 401K contributions. "
26739128630,Have an upvote to counter the downvotes. Its an honest question presented in a non-insulting way. Ill go ahead and answer. I dont know. I do think the current wage is very close to market price for whatever that is worth. Another way of saying that is that I dont believe a monopoly or other form of collusion is artificially keeping wages down for those types of workers.

To continually go around the system put in place to keep presidents from wielding to much power and dictate what will be done because he thinks it should be is fundamentally wrong. He is also showing clear signs that he is unfit to serve especially on the foreign affairs front. Drawing lines in the sand and then denied he said it. Wont do a dam thing about Russia. He is a serial liar. So, I liked my doctor and insurance, tell me again why I couldnt keep them when we where told repeatedly we could?

The email also infers that Obama has far surpassed his predecessors in using his executive powers. That, too, is way off.

27028761193,"Guns are evil? The only gun laws passed under Obama were to allow them in federal parks and at lawful protests. The only gun control law that obama is asking for is increasing background checks. And shockingly, most people already think background checks do everything obama wants them to do. Most people dont realize that there are so many ways around a background check. Both parties are equally lenient on illegals. Amnesty has historically been a republican thing anyways. We wont see this problem taken care of until one side moves to change it so children born of illegals are not citizens. It is a big problem when parents can be deported, but the kids cant be. As for the minimum wage, how can you be against a wage that allows someone to live on it? A wage so low that someone cannot live on is a slave wage. We should not be OK with any business paying out a slave wage. "
27028817959,"&gt; Guns are evil? The only gun laws passed under Obama were to allow them in federal parks and at lawful protests. Because there was a huge resistance from the 2nd amendment crowd. Most of the strong anti-gun rhetoric comes out of the left. To be fair, however, there are some anti-gun Republicans, and I happen to know a few *staunchly* pro-gun liberals. I dont claim it to be cut and dry across party lines, but it seems to me that most anti-gun folks are left leaning Democrats. &gt; Both parties are equally lenient on illegals. Amnesty has historically been a republican thing anyways. We wont see this problem taken care of until one side moves to change it so children born of illegals are not citizens. It is a big problem when parents can be deported, but the kids cant be. Yeah, historically Id say thats correct. But again, I feel (and this may not be statistically correct) that today, Democrats are pushing for more lenient rules. What really pisses me off is that neither party is placing a big focus on bringing in as many bright foreigners as possible. We need them...now more than ever, but thats getting a bit off topic. &gt; As for the minimum wage, how can you be against a wage that allows someone to live on it? A wage so low that someone cannot live on is a slave wage. We should not be OK with any business paying out a slave wage. [2.6% of workers earn minimum wage](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/08/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-about-2-percent-americans-get-pai/). Its a small number. You can argue that there is a significant percentage of people who earn between minimum wage and a figure that is higher, but still not good, but ultimately its still a small number. Furthermore, many of these people are between 16 and 24, meaning theyre working part time or living with family. The focus needs to be on what policy action the country can take to foster an environment that creates more, better paying jobs. We also have to consider that a minimum wage hike could harm small businesses. People love to say McDonalds should pay their employees more because they are a large corporation, but many people dont realize that a.) those stores are franchises (small businesses) and b.) they operate on razor thin margins. Im not saying that the discussion to raise minimum wage shouldnt be had, but it also shouldnt be at the front and center of the discussion on how to improve the economy. "
27028978400,"&gt; it seems to me that most anti-gun folks are left leaning Democrats. I see much more on the left about responsible gun ownership than on the right. On the right, they seem to want zero rules about guns and dont want to be held accountable if they are negligent. &gt;What really pisses me off is that neither party is placing a big focus on bringing in as many bright foreigners as possible. We need them...now more than ever, but thats getting a bit off topic. I would say the opposite is true. I work in a place where we have lots of people on work visas working. I know of someone who worked at an engineering firm in chicago where almost everyone was a foreigner on a work visa and they were doing engineering work on some government facility in los alamos. Work visas are out of hand and they are 100% displaying american workers. Engineering is quickly become less in demand purely because of the foreign labor force taking jobs so college grads cannot get hired. &gt;2.6% of workers earn minimum wage. That is 2.6% of workers earning $15,080 or less. A horribly misleading statistics. It excludes people who work extra hours to boost their pay, people who make near minimum wage such as $7.26, and people who get paid more purely because of tips, despite the fact that their employer is only paying them 15,080 a year @ 40 hours. Honestly I think 2.6% is damn high considering how narrow his statistic was. "

And to heap more onto that fact, many on the far right consist of that 37% that fault both Obama and the democrats outright, even though the ACA is law.

The idea is to set up a local insurgence within Ohios 8th. Note that theres no way that a district thats been red for like 80 years is going to suddenly go blue, that has to be a longer strategy, but if Boehner can be portrayed as a wishy-washy, compromised politician, he could find that hes vulnerable from the libertarian right. Im sure in Ohio you can find a good-looking, youngish veteran businessman, someone conservative but less neocon and more libertarian, who can make Boehner look decrepit and corrupt in comparison. Republicans love the whole pure of heart warrior makes good trope. Boehners actual record is something that can be used against him, too. [He lies a lot](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/john-boehner/), hes a corporatist, he very often undermines core Republican principles, Ted Cruz is fracturing the party because of Boehners failed leadership, hes kinda a big pussy, and hes made Ohios 8th into a laughing stock. If you can make him look like the liability he is to the GOP, if you can make it seem like he was given the reigns of the ship and hes run aground, and if you can have a superior replacement waiting in the wings, Boehner might have to come home and actually campaign for the first time since he was elected in the 90s. If he starts really campaigning, you know you will have had an effect on things, and thats when you start pushing for a debate. "

And on another aspect if the shutdown...why is it so hard to put forth a legitimate budget? Thats another reason for the shutdown. Obamas budget was rejected by everyone on both sides. There HAS to be compromise."
26883757133,"The ACA was a bill three years ago. The House of Reps voted it into law, same with Senate. That was three years ago -- all the negotiations and compromises were taken care of then. The Supreme Court held up the law as constitutional. Its implementation time. House Repubs are too late. Regarding the budget, Reid gave up a sequester fight to avoid Boehners ACA fight. But House Repubs reneged and demanded more concessions. This shutdown is squarely in Boehners court.

26883963555,"A little late to the party here, but I figured Id chime in with my $0.02. I live in Boehners district. In fact, he lives about five minutes away from me. I dont agree with his politics, but him and his wife are pretty nice people. The reason I bring this up is mainly to say that these politicians are still people, and we should see them as such. Hes representing this district, which is very conservative and very partisan. Most of the people here are not issue voters, but pretty much side with their party. Also, Gerrymandering, while it is a problem, isnt as big as people make it out be on this sub-reddit. It doesnt necessarily guarantee seats. Off of the top of my head, depending on the state, it makes a +/- 0.25%-2.15% difference. I wish I had access to my notebook so I could link to the original article that outlines that. I myself am very left on social issues and center-left on fiscal issues. The fact of the matter is that Boehner painted himself into a corner and is now dealing with a caucus that can basically hold a gun to his head. The reason he got the Speakership in the first place is because hes legendary for his fund raising ability, albeit also having a reputation for being a wine-pounding, cigar-smoking a-hole. Id be surprised if he kept his Speakership for more than the next cycle, and if hes not retired by 2016 or 2018 at the latest."

27036392982,"You are simply wrong. The president is a socialist who cannot do everything he wants in a single step. That is why he introduced the Affordable Care Act which is not single payer but will, if allowed to stand, eliminate the medical insurance industry and resolve to single payer. He did take over the operation of GM and Chrysler. That is no a capitalist act, it is a socialist act. He has doubled the number of people on food stamps and he has been using unemployment as an alternate welfare program by extending it indefinitely. He has suppressed the economy until people are using disability as an alternate welfare program. He is forcing people on welfare by subsidizing their health care insurance costs. You pretend that you dont understand that. Obamacare subsidizes health care to many who had no subsidization (or need for it) prior to Obamacare. This is another form of welfare he is promoting daily. He is controlling the medical insurance companies through the ACA. Everything he does has the goal of increasing dependency on the government with the eventual result of complete dependency on the government. He does not even try to hide his socialism.

The Republicans got their version of healthcare they originally wanted, the only reason theyre complaining is that it was implemented by Obama and not them. Its all politics."

26742929096,"The study seems off, since it is not looking at the marginal affect, instead just summing up the workers times benefit costs. A better answer would come from looking to some assessment of benefit use before and after a Wal-Mart opens in a community, to see if the workers consumed more or less public benefits after Wal-Mart came to town. It would be harder to do, obviously, but would get at the real issue: 1. By driving out higher wage employers and small businessmen, Wal-Mart increases those on the dole. 2. By giving jobs to those who are not employed Wal-Mart decreases reliance on public assistance. There is the separate question of whether Wal-Mart could survive without public assistance, be because its employees would otherwise starve, succumb to the elements or die without adequate medical care, but Im not sure how to test that hypothesis. "
26742909321,"Everybody should watch the documentary Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price. It was made circa 05 and mentions this exact issue. Wal-Mart treats their employees like shit (e.g. wages, benefits, etc.), which is one of the factors that allows them to lower their prices. This, in turn, increases the need for entitlement program coverage (e.g. food stamps) among other things. And we all know who carries the bill for that spending, the government (but really the American taxpayer pays the bill because... THE GOVERNMENT IS FUNDED BY US!)! People think theyre getting a deal by going to Wal-Mart, but in reality, their local economy is taking a hit, their taxes increase, their standard of living goes down, and no matter how convenient Wal-Mart is, its an eyesore and should cease to exist.

Trade Walmart for whatever evil business youd like. Walmart wont put a store up and continue to operate it where it is going to see a net loss. If a Walmart is profitable, it is by definition a fiscal drain on the community that it is a part of. This effect can be compounded when you consider the effect of low wages discussed in the article. Draining more local, state and federal dollars through social safety net programs that their employees are forced to use. So how do we fix this? Some people think its done by forcing Walmart to pay employees enough to live on. Well, if you increase the costs for Walmart to operate in a community, one of two things is likely to happen: either the store in community A is no longer profitable and must be shut down, forcing people to drive 30 miles to community B to get lower cost goods. Sucking tax dollars and jobs out of community A and more money out of those peoples pockets via vehicle and travel costs. Or you drive the costs of goods up to maintain store profitability. Making the extra dollars earned less powerful. Im not an economist, but this is obviously a complicated problem. No regulation doesnt work and well meaning but stupid regulation doesnt work either. Im afraid that pinning our hopes on well crafted and well intentioned legislation at this point in history is a pipe dream. TL;DR: Im cynical and not offering a solution."

Making people depend on government means money that could be going directly back into the private sector is being siphoned off in overhead and waste.

26742824189,"What a stupid study. Blaming walmart for people being on welfare? Lets look at it bit by bit. &gt;Walmart wages are so low that many of its workers rely on food stamps and other government aid programs to fulfill their basic needs But without their Walmart job they would require even more assistance correct? &gt;Though the study assumes that most workers who qualify for the public assistance programs do take advantage of them So, some who qualify for the programs manage to get by on their evil walmart salary and dont take advantage of said programs? &gt;According to the report, Walmart had more workers enrolled in the states public health care program in the last quarter of last year than any other employer, with 3,216 people enrolled. When the dependents of those workers were factored in, the number of enrollees came to 9,207. Could that be because Walmart is the largest private employer in the state of Wisconsin? http://worknet.wisconsin.gov/worknet/largemp.aspx &gt;When low wages leave Walmart workers unable to afford the necessities of life, taxpayers pick up the tab, When no wages leave workers unable to afford the necessities of life taxpayers pick up an even larger tab. &gt;After accounting for the total number of Walmart stores and employees across the state and the per-person costs of BadgerCare, as the states health care program is known, the reports authors estimated that the cost of publicly funded health care comes to $251,706 per year for a 300-employee Supercenter. So they simply count the number of people working at walmart and multiply that by the per person cost of the state health care plan? And this is considered a legitimate study? Because they know the headline is all that matters. &gt;The authors then added up the projected costs of other public-assistance programs available to families on BadgerCare... Assuming all those workers avail themselves of those additional programs -- granted, an unlikely scenario -- the report extrapolates that the final tab would top $900,000. Ok, lets rewrite this headline to fit the actual study. If every single walmart employee at a 300 person store received every single state welfare benefit offered, it could cost $900,000. &gt;In response to the report, Walmart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company was proud of the opportunities it provides for employees... noting that 75 percent of Walmart managers started as hourly employees. Wait, what? you mean Walmart actually provides not only jobs but opportunity for better jobs? &gt;The report, entitled The Low-Wage Drag on Our Economy, was produced by Democrats with the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is chaired by Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.). Good to see congress finally producing something useful. I wonder how much this crap study costs taxpayers? &gt;The labor policies of Walmart, and those of companies that emulate its low-road approach, end up leaving taxpayers holding the bag, Miller said in a statement. Maybe if we cut taxes low-road companies could afford to pay a higher wage? What kind of profit margin do you think evil walmart makes on average? Would you believe 3.5% in 2012? http://ycharts.com/companies/WMT/profit_margin &gt;Critics have long denounced Walmart for paying such low wages that many workers are forced to take advantage of public-assistance programs like food stamps or Medicaid. If the wages are so bad why are they working at Walmart? Does Walmart chain these people to the registers? Why dont they just go get better jobs? Whats that? They cant find an employer willing to pay more than Walmart? And Walmart is the bad guy? &gt;The Congressional reports timing is no accident. Miller, along with Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), has sponsored legislation that would raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 Now its not a study but a report... with an agenda. &gt;Democrats have argued that boosting the minimum wage would help pull some workers off of these programs &gt;Aubretia Edick, a Massachusetts woman who earns $11.70 an hour and receives public assistance, food stamps, Section 8 housing, and state-funded health care, Now Im not sure why they included this... 1. She works at Walmart and is making 1.5x minimum wage (I thought walmart was evil and didnt give out paychecks?) 2.

They brought basics, because everything else was too expensive (bread, butter, shitty cuts of meat). And I talk about luxuries for a reason. In my dads day, a new Tv cost a fortune. He would need to save up for months to buy one. Likewise when PCs were becoming popular, it cost my dad months to save up for one. Another thing to consider. Now days, women earn more and work more. My mother would work at best a part time, low paying job (75c in the dollar was an achievement). Most the time she didnt work at all. Now days it isnt hard to have a dual income household. Even if you dont have a SO, you can easily live with a friend to cut rent and other costs. So I dont really think you are giving it as much thought as you should. When you first move out, you often have to give up stuff. The same stuff my Dad lived without most of his life. * Shit housing. My dads first house was a 2 bedroom shack. * Crappy food. My dad lived off of cheap meat cuts, bread and butter. Anything else was a luxury. A bottle of softdrink was a very rare treat. * A crap box car that broke down all the time. My dad had several of those babies. * A mostly empty house as far as furniture and household goods go. My dad was lucky to own a small tv once he was well established.

27063229007,"I think the real reason is the fact that we dont want to give up anything. I moved out of home, I had to give up a few luxuries. When my Dad moved out of home at 17, he gave up virtually nothing (because most people had little wealth in terms of material possessions), but he gained a ton of freedom. When someone of our generation (young adults) moves out of home, we have to seriously downgrade everything. So in a way we are kinda spoiled. And it isnt easy going from a middle class + household to a low income one. "
27063793842,Politicians dont want deflation. They love inflation. They would rather see food destroyed or houses torn down than sold for less.
27063458568,"I am curious what your Dad did and what you do. Are you in the same industry? Interestingly enough, my dad was lucky to bring home 10$ an hr 30 years ago. And that was as a qualified tradesperson (he got barely anything as an apprentice). Now he earns upwards of 40+ an hr. "
27063276645,"When your dad moved out at age 17, the cost of living was vastly lower. These days, the average age of minimum wage workers is 35 and 88% of them are older than 20. http://www.epi.org/publication/wage-workers-older-88-percent-workers-benefit/ In Texas where I live, minimum wage does not cover average rent, utilities, transportation to work, food, and clothes/hygiene items from Walmart. According to basic math, there is nothing left for health insurance or a few luxuries. Furthermore, there are [3 applicants for every job opening](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/07/gene-sperling/there-are-3-unemployed-people-every-job-opening-ob/). So adults under the age of 35 are screwed instead of spoiled."
27063454497,"And other things costed way more (like Tvs, Mobile Phones, Air-conditioners / Heaters, most plastics ect.). Basically the majority of luxuries we take for granted, or as non-luxuries. Do you think my dad had the benefit of Chinas cheap exports? do you think every home had 3 tvs? Even computers and the internet were an expensive luxury as late as the 90s. You will simply see it how you want to. But if you choose to live how my Dad lived, you can have money to put in the bank. If you choose to live how you have lived while at your parents house, you probably wont stand a chance. "

26913626486,"Romneycare was done at the state level, not national. As many of you know, the GOP talks about States Rights a lot. This is a perfect example of something that can be supported at the state level, but not national. Theres no hypocrisy there, but its a laugh that after bashing the GOP for states rights talk so often, the left completely forgets the GOP is actually being consistent here. Further, the article doesnt really demonstrate much in the way of the results of this experiment in MA. Im sure there is plenty of debate, but its certainly not unequivocally wonderful. Massive cost overruns with healthcare becoming a rather large portion of the budget each year. Perhaps a failed experiment? And why would the GOP want to spread a failed idea all over the country? Is it logical that if you try an idea and it doesnt meet your goals, you should double down and spread that same concept everywhere? Or should you perhaps move on and try something different? Does it really make sense to say that since someone in the GOP had an idea in 1989, that that idea has to be followed forever, even after its been proven wrong in experimentation? Furthermore, if someone in the GOP comes up with a concept, does that mean every member of the GOP has to follow that idea forever, even if they didnt like it in the first place? Certainly not. Thankfully for the country, for instance, Democrats are no longer married to their former racist, Jim Crow ways. Nor do I hold them to the standard that they must have the same ideas forever, even after those ideas are proven bankrupt?"
26913370893,"A few inconvenient facts: If they actually loved it, as OP suggests, they certainly would have passed it when they controlled the House, Senate and White House during the 107th, 108th and 109th Congresses. Theres a big difference between individual states implementing (testing) various policies and imposing those policies at a federal level. What works in California or Massachusetts isnt automatically going to work for the whole country. More importantly, this policy did NOT work in Massachusetts where it was implemented - health care costs were astronomical. Obamacare was a 2,500-page bill. Of course it contained some things that Republicans liked, but the devil can often be in the details. Two people can agree on a destination and disagree about how to get there. Perhaps most importantly, Obamacare was constructed in such a way that a significant portion of the law was effectively left blank. Various executive departments controlled by President Obama (HHS, IRS, Commerce etc) were instructed to create the actual policy in the form of regulations. Thats why a 2,500 page bill has resulted in 30,000+ pages of regulations. Republicans rightly feared that this blank check would empower the regulators to impose specific policies that were controversial (for example, mandating 100% coverage of birth control). Long story short, theres a reason that Obamacare became law without a single GOP vote. And its not solely politics. There were and continue to be legitimate policy concerns."
26913451086,"This is just the most nonsensical argument that gets parroted. Who cares that some politicians advocated this in the past. It wasnt pased before and it shouldnt have been passed now. Also if you actually care Mitt Romney just tore apart how obamacare IS NOT romneycare. I dont support either, and many CURRENT politicians and citizens do not also. I support the changes to health insurance the CURRENT republicans in the House have called for."

I cant help but wonder how would things have gone had rational adults spent some time debating pros and cons and worked to resolve glaring issues. What we have had instead is BS fear mongering and the ridiculous mindless obstruction politics. I do remember one specific request from the conservative side as a condition to end the shutdown: they wanted to extend the deadline for the uninsured and underinsured. They wanted them to have more time to select and begin paying for a plan before the penalties kick in. Now a million or more underinsured have just learned that their plan will be cancelled and they must enroll in another plan on the exchange. Well considering what we went through over this past two months with the government shutdown, and Obamacare obstruction, and negotiations over whether to raise the debt ceiling its time for hardball negotiation. Obama should go ahead and give the conservatives what they wanted, extend all the deadlines by one year. And in exchange, taxes should be raised on the wealthy to cover the losses for that year. What difference will one year really matter to the long term viability of the Affordable Care Act? Will it fail to hit a certain mark by 10 years? So what...we wait eleven years. Meanwhile 25 million people have one more year to figure out what in the hell is going on with this insurance thingy. I mean seriously, were talking about the redneck, hillbilly, gangsta, vato set. Do we really expect all 25 million to process through the insurance industry over the next 2 to 6 months? Give these guys a break. Give the people who run the exchanges an extra year to work through the issues as well. All the chaos leading up to this rollout was more than enough to demoralize and confuse those responsible for implementation of the law. Give them a break. Give the conservatives what they want, extend the deadlines in exchange for something the liberals want. Sounds like a fair deal to me. "

Truth be told, Republicans were so taken with Heritage¡¯s design that a grand number of two of them ever went so far as to introduce a federal bill based on it and Mitt Romney used it as the basis of reform in deep-blue Massachusetts.

That would leave them open to make it a non-issue in the campaign, to fight on other wedge issues, suck credit for it away from the democrats AND attack it later on minor points of implementation whenever anything looked bad (like the website).

26913599553,"Its unclear to me why Republicans *dont* love Obamacare. * It mandates that far more people buy products from huge corporations, creating the potential for tremendous profit. * It redistributes wealth from the proportionally healthier, younger millenials and Gen-Xers (who normally might not buy insurance or might buy bare-bones, but will now be mandated to purchase plans with coverage they dont need nor want) to the boomers. The boomers failed to plan for retirement, so theyre not vacating the jobs that pay well, they ran the economy into the ground so if they *do* vacate those jobs the jobs are just being phased out or replaced by part-time positions, and otherwise generally kicked the ladder down behind them. The only way they can possibly screw us over more is to force us to pay for their healthcare, the cost of which will continue to balloon as they age and their clogged arteries catch up with them. * It creates a great excuse for businesses to turn full-time jobs into part-time jobs, which means less labor cost, and *still* not have to pay for benefits. Many of them went through their 20s, 30s, and 40s blowing their health insurance money on cocaine and big screen TVs. Now theyve got pre-existing conditions, and they need someone to foot the bill for their healthcare. What better way to do it than make those entitled youngsters finally pull some of their own weight around here? In short: Businesses getting richer. Check. Boomers getting richer / avoiding responsibility. Check. Seems like a Republican dream to me."
27060887283,"I for one, against the beliefs of many in my circles, cannot wait until they raise the minimum wage even more. Soon it will be cheaper to have robots cook burgers in an assembly line than to have a sub par human that deserves more money than his labor is worth to cook it."

The reason the democrats push for an increase in the minimum wage is some union contracts are tied to the MW. ie: The MW goes up $1 their wage goes up too (of course much more). 3. Every on think Walmart and MickieDs, buy more mom and pop enterprises will be effected. Point of fact few Walmart and McD employees make minimum wage. 4.Where will the money come from? Easy the prices of things will go up, it is called inflation. 5. People that will be hurt most? The people who currently make $2 or 3 above MW their wages will not go up but their buying power will be decreased due to prices going up. Now go ahead and down vote me if you must does not make my points wrong. Ask yourself where you stand in the wage scale, at minimum wage? If not you WILL loose buying power. And as the Congressional budget office says we will loose another 500,000 jobs will one be yours? Also as an adult if you have been working for more than a year and are still making MW most likely the problem is you not the MW."

27061056868,"Poverty is an incredibly hard socioeconomic state to rise out of. I hate when I hear people claim that If you work hard enough, you can get yourself out of it! Its not just about hard work. In order to progress you also need opportunities to present themselves. Just because you work 60 hours at McDonalds doesnt mean your going to rise out poverty. You need to be exposed to different people, making new connections and thus providing various employment opportunities. But meeting new people proves to be difficult when you devote all your energy to a job paying minimum wage just to skim-by financially. A sense of ambition also needs to exist. You need to know that you can achieve in other fields of the workforce. Unfortunately, people that grow up in poverty typically go to poorly funded schools, where their self esteem can take a beating due to various factors like a weak teaching staff, low grades, and unproductive peers that instill a similar mind set of mediocrity. From there it can become a cycle within the family, teaching the same hard facts of life to their children. In short, hard work is not enough to rise out of poverty. You need opportunities to present themselves and need the ambition and self-confidence to take them. TL;DR: Hard work, opportunity, and self-confidence are all required to progress. "

27061349546,"Personally, I think that minimum wage laws have to be balanced with a high corporate and personal tax rate for people making more than a certain amount of money. If the amount of profit isnt capped, then all the costs can be effectively passed onto the consumer, whereas if they are capped, there is a tax incentive to reinvesting in employees and capital investments."

27061554340,The minimum wage is a poor alternative to a system which pays people equally for the work they do no matter what that work is. There should be a rate of hourly pay which it costs to hire a persons to labor in whatever job you have for them. The system of paying people based on what you can leverage their labor for leads to unbalance.
27060716393,"Thats because minimum wage policy alone *cannot* lift people from poverty. If increasing wage floors were tied to increases in wealth, then why not just make it $20 an hour? $50 an hour? $100 an hour?

If you create or raise minimum wage the only way around this, if you hold current productions, it to raise prices...and in most cases, the prices that get raised are those that relate to the people getting minimum wage. Additionally, raising minimum wage means more people pay more tax.

Single, 2 kids - Youre $3700 below the poverty line, but get a $5400 refundable EITC, so youre 10% above the poverty line. Married, 1 kid - Youre $3700 below the poverty line, but that assumes only 1 parent is working. With the refundable EITC, you would be right at the poverty line, but then add in the other parent working even 20 hrs per week and you are 20% above the poverty line. Married, 2 kids - With the EITC, you are $3600 below the poverty line. So if the other parent works 8 hrs per week, you hit the poverty line. Im completely ignoring any other social programs in this. Just straight up pay and EITC, which everyone working (with kids) gets if they dont make too much money. Im not saying they are well off or fine. If we think the poverty line is too low, that is another discussion. But these people can live above the poverty line at the current minimum wage."
27060827457,"One problem with a wage floor is that owners/management/investors (exploiters) can continue to raise prices for their goods and services and stuff all the additional profits into their own pockets rather than paying their staff better. Thus the cost of living rises but the wage floor rarely if ever improves. Probably a better solution than a wage floor, at least in theory, is a top-to-bottom pay ratio like the Swiss 1:12 Initiative."
27062212731,The fix: Universal living wage disbursed income just for being alive. Universal single payer healthcare. no income tax for individuals. Flat fair tax at 7% on all services and new goods.

27060830254,"What will raising the minimum wage accomplish for most people? Most jobs arent minimum wage. People still struggle. Minimum wage jobs are usually (I stress usually) filled by the young, the inexperienced, or the under achieving. Honestly, this is just another entitlement generation issue. Im special. Im perfect. I deserve more. I was happy to have a minimum wage job in high school. I was happy to have those entry level positions that educated and prepared me. I worked my way up the ladder. Im sorry, but I dont think pushing a button and waiting for ding, fries are done is worth $10.10 an hour. Considering in some areas EMTs and first responders barely make more that $10 an hour its insulting. Furthermore, because they make slightly more than the proposed minimum wage, they will not see a raise. No, our problem isnt minimum wage. Its lifestyle and lack of willingness to earn a better life. If one cant survive on a minimum wage job, maybe one should get an additional part time job. "

27061132335,"The War on Poverty came about shortly before the U.S. liberalized its immigration policy. While I in no way wish to go back to the days where we restricted immigration everywhere in the world except Western Europe we have to acknowledge that a lot of the countrys new poor comes from recent immigrant backgrounds. These people dont typically stay in poverty for generations but we have a constant and growing stream of lower income immigrants which means that many of these individuals and families will live in poverty for some time as they establish their roots in a new country. While this isnt the case for all families entrenched in poverty, education/employment opportunities are obviously the biggest factor for those, the rise in immigration coupled with a more competitive job market with the moving of blue collar jobs out of the country through agreements like NAFTA certainly hurt the most vulnerable families in America significantly. This is all ignoring the fact that public assistance benefits have been reduced steadily for decades now."
27061158592,"Immigration has declined, but that never was the problem. The problem is the cycle of poverty from one generation to another, and another... Thats what has to be fixed. Globalization is a fact, it has very little to do with trade agreements. International corporations have adapted very well, some governments have not. Thats why we can buy smartphones, computers, tablets, clothes. A pair of jeans made in Vietnam is $35. A pair made in the US is $150. NAFTA and the TPP are efforts to cope with globalization instead of keeping economic problems from failure to deal with it. "

Obama even put bans on contraception for teenagers once -- before the 12 election. Surprisingly every Democrat was too busy cheering and campaigning on the concept of womens reproductive health to notice that Obama last major decision on the issue was to undercut it. I guess Republicans did it all too, or maybe they even started it. Heck, the govt has done these sorts of things forever, no reason to be alarmed now. And to his credit Obama tried to fix things, at least he thought about trying, but Republicans just wouldnt let him.

Hes actively campaigning to end Obamacare - its clear. He isnt. He made a small address for crying out loud lol. He is not as gung ho about Obamacare as other republicans who are just looking out for corporate profits. &gt;Nice strawman. They were saying that spilled milk can cause environmental damage, and thus we should regulate it as we regulate other liquids that can cause damage when they spill.

Your link not only confirms this, but Obama eliminated the rule, not the EPA as you assert. &gt;Another strawman. If they had proof, theyd go after them. Theres no proof that NG is the cause of these symptoms. I suggest you watch Gas Land 2. The EPA is very aware that these natural gas wells are poisoning the water table surrounding them. They are protecting the industry. See, i dont think youre willing to admit whats actually happening with this agency. &gt;Because to the intellectually honest, context matters. I was never wrong as I wasnt the one who asserted he supported Ryans budget (that was someone else) - I was adding context to your correction so that it wasnt misleading people into thinking Amash opposes drastic cuts to the budget, beyond that of even Paul Ryan. Context? He doesnt support the budget lol. Youre clearly trying to associate him with Paul Ryan and that type of republican. Amash wants cuts where Ryan doesnt because Ryan has his rich buddies and special interests in mind. You may somehow think its worse that Amash wants cuts across the board and not just in areas of social welfare, but as far as republicans go, that IS a breath of fresh air. &gt;For example, Youd probably shout from the rooftops that a majority of Americans opposed Obamacare when it passed, and Id chime in with the context being that is only true if you include in the opposition the people who were upset that it didnt go far enough, i.e. single payer. See, that tells a completely different and more accurate story. But it wont stop people like Amash from insisting Americans opposed Obamacare! I literally oppose Obamacare for this reason and so do many people around here. The mandate without an accompanied restructuring to make insurance non-profit by law is nothing more than corporate welfare. &gt;Isnt that *literally* what he was insisting upon with his opposition to Ryans budget? He knew it wouldnt pass, so he took the free opportunity to go on record as favoring deeper cuts to services and more money to the top 2%. He didnt even need to - Ryans budget was a nonstarter and a political stunt, but he took the opportunity to clarify his position as being *even further to the right* of his party. i think you read my comment wrong. Consider for a moment we have massive spending on social programs for the poor but even larger handouts for the rich and well connected. Paul Ryan wants to protect the rich, and if anything give them more. Amash wants cuts across the board. So you may think thats worse, but i find fiscal conservatives who want to increase welfare for their rich friends to be worse "
26808095864,"&gt;I think thats from Jim Bridenstine... Youre right...oddly Amash has it posted onn his website on the speeches section. Heres something from [Amash himself. ](http://amash.house.gov/speech/rep-justin-amash%E2%80%99s-floor-statement-hr-2-repealing-job-killing-health-care-law-act). Hes actively campaigning to end Obamacare - its clear. &gt;As far as MILK goes, you really think Exxon spilling oil all over the place has the same impact if it was milk? Thats what the EPA was doing, it was equating milk to oil. Nice strawman. They were saying that spilled milk can cause environmental damage, and thus we should regulate it as we regulate other liquids that can cause damage when they spill. [But hey, the EPA overturned that rule anyway.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-he-eliminated-epa-rule-treating-/) &gt;They went after MILK but they wont go after companies that turn peoples drinking water into flammable liquid. Another strawman. If they had proof, theyd go after them. Theres no proof that NG is the cause of these symptoms. &gt;So what? He doesnt support Paul Ryans budget. You were wrong. Because to the intellectually honest, context matters. I was never wrong as I wasnt the one who asserted he supported Ryans budget (that was someone else) - I was adding context to your correction so that it wasnt misleading people into thinking Amash opposes drastic cuts to the budget, beyond that of even Paul Ryan. For example, Youd probably shout from the rooftops that a majority of Americans opposed Obamacare when it passed, and Id chime in with the context being that is only true if you include in the opposition the people who were upset that it didnt go far enough, i.e. single payer. See, that tells a completely different and more accurate story. But it wont stop people like Amash from insisting Americans opposed Obamacare! &gt; Hes not some hypocrite talking about cutting spending for the poor while wanting to hand out subsidies to the rich Isnt that *literally* what he was insisting upon with his opposition to Ryans budget? He knew it wouldnt pass, so he took the free opportunity to go on record as favoring deeper cuts to services and more money to the top 2%. He didnt even need to - Ryans budget was a nonstarter and a political stunt, but he took the opportunity to clarify his position as being *even further to the right* of his party. "

It is not uncommon to report preliminary findings and summary progress in order to justify or make the case for being allowed more resources or to build publicity. Investigations arent usually completely funded and organized upfront. I mean, does the fact that leaks and preliminary findings (such as dropping big values for damage caused by climate change, etc.) have come from the IPCC mean they know its BS? Out of curiosity, if some prosecutions come out of this investigation, will you support voter ID laws? I think that most of the cases are unintentional, so they are not prosecuted.

Nobody bought cars, nobody bought houses in the suburbs...WWII was a miserable time to live through, just as bad as the decade earlier, if not worse.

This guy is arguing that because they flipped open his phone, it was an unconstitutional search. The question is whether we can say that simply flipping open a cell phone is different from doing a search of the persons wallet. I cant see that differentiation. I really hope this case gets cert denied, because its a terrible case.

Military wont be happy, they have a budget to fulfill, also we have some contractors working there too, theyll be out of jobs... - can I **actually do anything that I promised???** You get the idea. When Spanish now president was campaigning he promised not to raise taxes, after a couple of months in the job, he raised the taxes, he tried not to but then Merkel and even USA government told him dude, you **want** to raise taxes. Now hes happily telling everybody how Merkel and USA are happy with higher taxes because, well, its better. However due to higher taxes small business is going bankrupt. From outside it seemed to me that Obama was the man for the change but then I read about people who caused the economic collapse still having important jobs and still making decisions and thought poor Obama, he wont be able to do shit and hell get the blame. I know I might be wrong and he just lied his way to power and now hes enjoying it, but I kind of believe that the guy had his best intention to fulfill everything he promised but then he found the hard way he cant actually do shit.

26832302831,What the fuck is Obama trying to pull here? Does he not give a fuck that everyone who voted for him despises the shit that he pulls on a daily basis now?
26832575075,Thats how you know our phones have been open books since early days in the Cheney Administration. 
26832294161,Tyranny. 
26832183313,"On the other hand, the Massachusetts case involves a primitive flip-phone, which could make this a bad test case. I suspect that is the reason the government chose this one and they will try to apply the precedent to any phone in police custody."

26832552985,"For rooted Android users theres a good way to prevent the cops from snooping into your privacy, should they get your phone for some reason. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsdroid.cerberus Its a paid service however its only a few bucks for a life time license. It lets you do all kinds of things to screw over anyone who steals your phone such as take pictures with the front or back camera, take screencaps, send you an email of their text messages and phone call logs, and it can also wipe your phones internal memory which is what would be useful here. It can remotely reboot your phone into recovery mode where it then wipes your phones data partition. In other words, when your phone comes back on its like it was when you first turned it on. So even if the cops do search your phone, theyre not going to find a thing. It can also wipe your SD cards. I would suggest doing that first since it also deletes itself when it does the data partition wipe."
26832204060,This kind of shit is gonna get a republican elected president again
26832382875,"1. Obama really has no say in these matters. Hes taking his orders from higher-ups. 2. This is a moot issue anyway, as the NSA is feeding peoples personal information to the DEA, FBI, CIA, and local law enforcement anyway."
26832414208,"People realize that Obama doesnt make decisions whether or not to appeal these cases, right? These decisions are up to the prosecutors or the DOJ and it would be highly inappropriate for the executive branch to interfere with individual cases."
26832364033,"Because the supreme court rules on favors, not the constitution, right?"
26831961104,Obama administration asks Supreme Court to allow violation of Fourth Amendment rights.
26832180872,Whats next? Cameras in every home? Military patrols in the streets? Suspension of free elections? Nothing would surprise me at this point.
26832137482,My least favorite thing about reading this kind of stuff is knowing the next election will be nothing but Im not Obama from both sides. But it will be the same people doing the same things. Im not even mad anymore. I just wish theyd put out some new episodes instead of endless re-runs.

26832292019,"The real question is where the hell did they dig up a picture of a 12 year old Motorola v60, and how the hell someone thought people would actually recognize that as a phone anymore..."
26832370871,Whats next? Warrant-less house and car searches?
26832133415,Can you feel the boot on your neck yet? 
26832460449,"This is actually a little misleading. Its already been Constitutionally approved by the courts, for years, for police to search an individual in conjunction with an arrest. So while its technically warrantless, the search inherently has probable cause based upon the arrest."
26832834733,"&gt; the government argues that the First Circuit¡¯s ruling conflicts with the rulings of several other appeals courts, as well as with earlier Supreme Court cases. Those earlier cases have given the police broad discretion to search possessions on the person of an arrested suspect, including notebooks, calendars and pagers. The government contends that a cellphone is no different than any other object a suspect might be carrying. This seems like a perfectly legitimate complaint. This is a grey area of law and, since there is no relevant legislation, a Supreme Court decision is needed to clarify exactly the intent of the laws. Once made, the decision will establish precedent for all future cases. This seems like something where such precedent a) does not exist currently and b) would be immensely important. Also, not sure what this has to do with Obama, the justice department challenges circuit rulings all the time..."
26832486056,Thanks Obama 
26832716837,"If they are asking for permission, it means they are already doing it."
26831914932,"Id say no. Like the article points out, modern cell phones house a wealth of personal information. We are basically carrying a PC around in our pockets. If that doesnt equal a modern version of papers, and effects, I dont know what would. It will come down, as it usually seems to do, what the Court decides is unreasonable."
26832460462,Title is misleading. Its in situations of arrest. Not whether they feel like looking through your phone or not.
26831972473,Just when you thought it couldnt get *any* worse...
26832057591,The Obama Administration is no longer trying to hide their authoritarian ambitions at all. They are going balls to the wall trying to bring in a complete military dictatorship before his term ends.
26832085924,This is completely wrong but I suppose I should be glad that Im too poor to afford a smart phone and the data plans they come with.
26832093693,I cannot believe this bullshit is still happening. Youd think theyd give up the damn act and issue their mea culpa. Shit.
26832107692,First thing Ill do if I get pulled over is reach discreetly into my center console and shut off my phone. Best not to leave anything up to chance.
26832122072,"A Motorola V60? Honestly, half of those phones still in service are probably in the vicinity of a bomb. "
26832124923,Big Brother Obama! 
26832128524,"Fucking hell, just stop it already. Is it not clear that this country is tired of this shit? Obama, I support you as a person, but fuck you for doing this."
26832159124,"Who the hell voted for Obama, and if its you, why are you complaining? Didnt you get that Chicago politicians lie? Did you believe all that hope and change crap? If so, you got what you asked for."
26832177033,"Chill out, its just meta data anyways /sarcasm"
26832218390,as if he gives a fuck
26832223521,"Ladies and gentleman, a former constitutional law professor. Can we stop attaching that title to him as though it means anything?"
26832225136,"Obama, the savior that forgot to save. "
26832232894,No.
26832239313,"You people voted for this terrorist piece of shit, now you deal with it. If you have to riot and tear down the White House gates, then you do it. Dont complain, take action."
26832242795,Anthony Weiner was shamed for posting nudes on twitter. David Petraeus resigned because of an affair. He was linked to it via his email account. John Roberts changed his vote for Obamacare after receiving a call concerning the laptop he had sent in for work. These things mean something.
26832243623,"i dont get it. when youre under arrest, dont they get your name and address anyway? can i really go out and do crime without a phone or ID, and then say uh, i dunno to the police when they ask me where i live?"
26832258330,Just like thugs. Thats actually typical for a black guy to search someone for a phone. Why muricans you are not done with him yet? Chickens

26832270417,You all still enjoying the president you were warned about not voting for? But you all bought into the bullshit speeches. Next time research your candidate before you vote idiots. 
26832274199,Dont they already have all this information by other means?
26832282485,"why the fuck do we even still have a bill or rights if the executive branch wants to side step it, the legislative branch does nothing when it is violated, and then Judicial rubber stamps the violating?"
26832284720,"So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasnt much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didnt have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, See that man? Hes acting just like Jesus wants us to. For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I havent shaved in awhile so Im rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said Like Jesus? Maam Im an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all. As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment."
26832287012,At least he asked this time
26832289725,"Tip: for a little extra security and a little extra defensibility in court, encrypt and password protect anything. Its far from a solid defense, but I know of at least one case where a woman was protected from having to expose her password due to her fifth amendment rights."
26832297322,This fucker was a [constitutional law professor](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/obama-a-constitutional-law-professor/)? Seriously? What the FUCK is wrong with him? Id pay money to see him try to defend this in a formal (not political but formal) debate.
26832298801,More transparency from our lords and masters. Great.
26832315481,Still bettet than romney.
26832339193,The supreme court doesnt actually have that authority.
26832339561,Land of the free.
26832343006,Hows that Hope &amp; Change working out for you?
26832345654,"For Obamas first term I kept complaining that he wasnt doing shit. Now I just wish he would stop doing shit. For the love of god the guy has no fucking clue about tech and rights! (yes I know he studied/practiced constitutional law, but you cant tell by his actions)"
26832354291,Obama... youre breaking my heart );
26832354594,This is it. This is the decision that swings things one way or another for a very long time.
26832355864,"Crazy when Obama said he wanted to connect with regular Americans, he was actually foreshadowing his current manipulation of government."
26832357017,"Obama is just doing his job to keep the country safe, I dont get what the big fuss is about. People want to be protected but then they whine over little shit like this. Its obvious most people have no clue how govt. works and just want to bitch and moan."
26832359908,"Up to today Obama, Holder, and the Surpeme Court have shown no respect or regard for the law of the Constitution. We the people will have to wait until November 4th to select Americas savior. "
26832362379,What in the fuck Obama.
26832366568,"this is scary! so if this passes, being pulled over = my phone taken and searched through? if i have a password I guess it would be illegal to refuse entering it. I hope someone invents a way to wipe your phone clean via entering a special password like how home alarms work. "
26832368728,I feel like a scumbag Obama meme is needed. Bloody hell when will this shit end?
26832372705,"I mean hey, at least he asked this time."
26832381007,Can anyone verify this? Theres absolutely no way they could even consider searching phones without a warrant legal... right? Even in our fucked up country no way.
26832382058,"Remember, this has absolutely nothing to do with his constitutional obligation to defend federal law in court."
26832382629,"Ill bite, I might agree to this if and when we have a 100% transparent government with no secret courtrooms. When I can see everything they are doing I might be a little more ok about it when they want to see what Im doing."
26832390340,Im tired of Obama and his shit.

26832400433,im not liking this Obama guy
26832406188,"So we DO have a problem! &gt; If people can¡¯t trust not only the executive branch but also don¡¯t trust Congress, and don¡¯t trust federal judges, to make sure that we¡¯re abiding by the Constitution with due process and rule of law, then we¡¯re going to have some problems here. - Barrack Obama "

26832414461,Fuck this guy and the rest of the bunch. Van Holen can also bite it. Not voting Democrat ever again. Third party or republican. At least with a republican I know what I am getting and know how to set up for my financial future. The only way we win is to vote them out. 
26832424070,We need a fucking Batman!
26832425304,Thats such an egregious invasion of privacy Im speechless.
26832464224,"Christ, does he have no shame at all?"
26832470075,Id vote for him a fifth and sixth time.
26832475339,Just repeal the whole constitution. Someone should try to do that just to make a point about how its pointless anyway.
26832480156,"How much does having a lock code protect you? Can you be compelled to hand it over? It so, I can designate a family member to wipe my phone remotely in case I go to jail for whatever. Fortunately, I abide by the law. :)"

26832483523,Well this is disconcerting
26832496621,I think the misspelled *Stasi* because it says *Obama Administration*.
26832505644,"...sigh.. I voted for Obama. Twice. And ever since that second time around Ive really really been regretting that choice. Can someone make me feel better about this guy because Im feeling pretty down about him being my president what with all this bullshit with the NSA, drones, warrantless shit, etc etc. "
26832507243,"Christ, I cant stand these people. &gt;On the other hand, the Massachusetts case involves a primitive flip-phone, which could make this a bad test case. The specific phone involved in this 2007 incident likely didn¡¯t have the wealth of information we store on more modern cellphones. Were only violating their constitutional rights a little, so thats okay. What, does that mean that they get to open just one letter every now and then, or search the shed on your property without a warrant, because, you know, its just a small violation?"
26832513427,"Out of curiosity, the document specifically mentions: &gt; Whether the Fourth Amendment permits the police, without obtaining a warrant, to review the call log of a cell phone found on a person who has been lawfully arrested. Does that mean that the search would be limited to the Call Log section of a cellphone? Or is the term broad enough that the ruling would apply to email, text messages and any other files or documents stored on the cellphone? I mean, this isnt 1990 anymore. Smartphones are now the norm and can be used as the equivalent of a computer."
26832514121,It is a very misleading title. It should be that the Obama administrations wants the police to be allowed to search cell phones of people who were arrested. That is a big distinction. Still they should not be able to search the phone without some type of probable cause. The only problem is the threshold for PC is so low the police will usually be able to meet the standard. 
26832522883,So is this something that people on both sides agree is fucked up? 
26832525466,I asks Obama to go jump off of a bridge
26832529219,"Tell me how bad bush was again? You cant justify one murder by saying yeah I killed someone but another guy I know did too thats been every pro Obama argument Ive come across in the last 6 months. he had a chance to make a difference and with all that blathering on about how his hope and change would make the world a better place, Id like an apology from anyone who still defends him. Hope and change dont get you a job, get you an A in class theyre feelings and emotions not actions."
26832529493,They probably know everything about me already so I dgaf.
26832530648,Still happy you voted for this guy o-holes?
26832534969,Classic Obama administration.
26832536514,NO! you were supposed to ask them to allow Medical Marijuana! dumbdumbs.
26832536984,Good news is that Hillary will be much better!
26832539460,"Dammit Obama, I voted for you because you were a professor of Constitutional Law. How can you keep shredding the rights you swore to protect, you coward?"
26832543776,Why do we have presidents who seem to want to be the worst instead of the best?
26832552557,Obama has watched too many episodes of The Wire.
26832554655,TIL: Obama is a dick. 
26832563749,How about we all take a collective shit on the 4th amendment and call it a day

26832577280,"Is it just me or does anyone else feel like something big is coming? I mean not like a civil war but something else I cant quite put my finger on. I just feel like the US is preparing for something slowly,or maybe its just the weed."

26832623936,"I feel like this is bullshit. When I was 16, I had a little run in with my mother where she slammed my head against a wooden floor. I called 911 and the police ended taking the side of the adult in the situation so I ended up getting arrested and taken to the police station. My mom wanted me to take my cell phone with me so I had numbers and a way of contacting people if I needed to. The police acted like it was a good idea and it would be helpful for me. In fact, they encouraged it. Later, when I got to the station, they ended taking my phone, going through the contacts/text messages, and interrogating me on every other underage youth that had any kind of run in with the police. They even asked me why I was hanging out/knew such people and therefore I must be a troublemaker since I had them in my phone. I lived in a town with only one high school and it houses less than 2,000 students. It wouldnt be surprising to assume I knew most of the kids in my grade level. So, my vote is no on this one. I feel like its something that can and will be abused. Not to mention, I didnt even have a smart phone. I could imagine how that would have turned out. "

26832648675,"The problem with a typical search during an arrest, is they can arrest you on any grounds. Then perform a search of your smart phone or computer and look for evidence on non-related cases. THIS is the problem and the reason for warrants to make sure abuse doesnt happen. If they need to search the phone/computer then a warrant is easy to get, hell the judges basically rubber stamps them now. All this does is make the cop state under perjury that the warrant is required to a related crime. We know that either party the Democrats or Republicans would back this. So why do you keep voting for them? Vote for people with a track record or a 3rd party. Ive stopped voting the two parties years ago, and its messed up some elections. If more people did that, Id bet they would take notice. Also, where the fuck is the Pirate Party, Id so vote for them as long as they leave my 2nd amendment alone... :) (Also the main reason I wont vote Democrat) "

Thats what they do."

Yes, he promised something that he didnt have the power to do, but at least he tried. &gt; we are still at war The Iraq war is over and thats all he campaigned on stopping. He never campaigned on stopping war in general, and did say that he planned on increasing efforts in Afghanistan. We may both disagree with it, but its not a broken promise. &gt; drone strikes I dont remember him ever campaigning against this, but youre welcome to educate me. &gt; immigration The ACA took too long and now he has an uncooperative congress. If anything, Im upset that he didnt live up to the idea I had of him in my head that he would be able to achieve things by bringing both sides to consensus. But somehow the right went more right, and consensus became impossible. Has Obama been perfect? No. But its also ridiculous to declare everything you *wished* for him to be as a *campaign promise*."

Regarding drone strikes he continually campaigned against Bushs foreign policy and counter terrorism efforts.

26877781854,"Its not 20% profit...its 20% overhead+profit....larger companies(the ones that will probably dominate the exchanges) have 85%-15% rule. Another thing is all the plans are the same, so apart from some brand loyalty or customer service ratings most people will gravitate toward the lowest costing plan(why wouldnt they o.o?) Im not saying your idea is a legit concern, but itd take a large collusion between the insurance carriers and the providers."
26877666472,This is exactly what I was thinking. There is no real incentive to lower your costs rather then increase their expenses.
26877665910,"This is the first thing I thought when I heard the 80% rule. If they cant get a larger slice of the pie, the only way to get more profits is to intentionally make the pie bigger. Hopefully competition will prevent this, but honestly I have no idea whats going to happen."
26877666724,"State insurance regulators/commissioners still have to approve increases in insurance premiums. Unless you live in Flordia, where Governor Voldemort, nee Bat Boy, cooperated with the legislature to ban the state insurance regulator from regulating premiums for the next two years. The full story is a little more complicated, basically Florida was trying to force the federal government to regulate its insurance market. But as Obamacare is essential a federal assistance program for states to run their own insurance markets, the federal government does not have the power to regulate insurance in Florida. So in Floridas zeal to not implement Obamacare, they screwed their citizens into 2 years of unregulated rate increases. &gt;What resulted was Florida Senate Bill 1842, which among other things, suspended for two years the requirement that insurers get state approval for rates for new plans ¡ª such as those that will appear on new marketplaces. Companies would still have to file rate changes with the state. But they could act on those changes without approval. "
26877650337,"Not at all. Insurers can raise rates, and still maintain the 80% rule as long as providers charge more for services. Heres a simple example. Say your premium is $1,000 a month and you use $800 a month for cancer treatments. The insurance company profits the other $200. Now they want to make more, so they charge you $1,500 a month. But they have to maintain the 80%, so they renegotiate with your hospital to start charging $1,200 a month for your cancer treatment. Its a Win-Win-Lose scenario. Guess which one you are. "
26881665088,"Better to ask that site, Im afraid I cant justify their numbers. Looking at politifact: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/30/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-medicare-overhead-far-lower-pri/ Apparently overall overhead is 10% but looking at it on a plan-by-plan basis, plans for large companies have lower overhead and those for smaller companies higher. 10% still seems high, but not nearly as obscene. (Not that I can point to absolute evidence of them only being 10% either.)"

Gohmert would have had a stronger argument if he¡¯d said that was the case six years ago, when candidate Barack Obama was vacuuming up Wall Street donations. The problem is, that¡¯s no longer true. In fact, the exact opposite pattern has held for Wall Street donations during the past three election cycles."

27151039052,"That doesnt support your statement at all. In fact, it directly proves it wrong. You are pretending that the 2012 election is a perfect representation of the last three elections and you are pretending the investments and securities industry in that 2012 election is a perfect representation of all corporate donations. None of which is true. "
26982408103,"So, what was wrong with [the Manchin-Toomey gun proposal](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/apr/30/summary-manchin-toomey-gun-proposal/). Just how much less could it have been?"
26982383022,"From an earlier post of mine: &gt; Theres already a electronic background check called NICS that is used for every sale that goes through a gun dealer. However **private sellers are not allowed to use it;** they have no access. Weve got millions of people who would love a way to check whether the person theyre selling a gun to (or buying it from) is a felon, but all they can do is check the persons ID, write down the number, and hope. I suspect if NICS were open for the general public, then 99%+ of sales would involve a check without any legal requirement being imposed. &gt;If, for some reason, that proved to be inadequate, then there could be a law requiring private sellers use NICS. &gt;However, Democrats have only proposed a nationwide system of firearm-*registration*. Its not labeled as such, but if you outlaw private sales, and thereby require every sale go through a dealer, and those dealers must keep a record of every transaction, then youve just created a complete list of every gun that ever legally changes hands. People wouldnt be required to register the guns they already own, but within one generation (parents passing guns down to their kids) the lists would be complete, and yet its passed off as a minor act of closing some technical loophole. "
26982433983,"&gt; Just how much less could it have been? 1. It could have opened NICS for public use, and done nothing more., OR 2. It could have opened NICS for public use, and required the private sellers use it, OR 3. Required sales go through dealers, and remove the requirement that dealers keep a record of their sales. &gt; what was wrong with the Manchin-Toomey gun proposal[?] The provisions against registration are toothless: - It says, ~ Hey, what were doing here is not a registration system dont call it one. - The AG is prohibited from consolidating or centralizing the records, but a complete list of every transaction must none-the-less be made across dealers and kept at their shops. - The AG is prohibited from seizing any records, except in the case of a crime (and if any guns are ever banned then their illegal possession would be a crime). Edit: Also, NICS requires too much information. Its fine to require whatever is needed to identify the individual , but a background check should not require the make, model, serial number, and caliber of the gun thats being purchased."

26793684401,"&gt;Splain, please. Are you a member of a **well-regulated militia**? Absolutely countries like UK, Australia are safer. I provided sources on homicide rates and the difference between the U.S. and the other industrialized countries is hugely significant. On homicide with guns, of course, the U.S. blows everyone out of the water. From [CDC:](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046149.htm) &gt;Overall, the data provided by the 26 countries included a total of 2872 deaths among children aged less than 15 years for a period of 1 year. Homicides accounted for 1995 deaths, including 1177 (59%) in boys and 818 (41%) in girls. Of the homicides, 1464 (73%) occurred among U.S. children. The homicide rate for children in the United States was five times higher than that for children in the other 25 countries combined (2.57 per 100,000 compared with 0.51) (Table_1). &gt;A firearm was reported to have been involved in the deaths of 1107 children; 957 (86%) of those occurred in the United States. Of all firearm-related deaths, 55% were reported as homicides; 20%, as suicides; 22%, as unintentional; and 3%, as intention undetermined. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S. children aged less than 15 years was nearly 12 times higher than among children in the other 25 countries combined (1.66 compared with 0.14) (Table_1). The firearm-related homicide rate in the United States was nearly 16 times higher than that in all of the other countries combined (0.94 compared with 0.06); the firearm-related suicide rate was nearly 11 times higher (0.32 compared with 0.03); and the unintentional firearm-related death rate was nine times higher (0.36 compared with 0.04). Yes, I am angry. I am angry that the special interest groups like the NRA have captured the US government in order to sell more guns at any cost. I am angry about gun nuts who vote on guns alone and paralyze and hijack the country. One person who votes based on NRA scorecards is one too many. &gt;There is also absolutely nothing Bloomberg could to do make him give me money. I almost agree with you. There are very few things Bloomberg can do to make me give him money. One of those very few things is taking down the NRA."
26794297637,So youre mad at an organization &amp; feel the need to take it out on anyone that supports the 2nd Amendment. Got it.
26793744747,"Youre wasting your time. There is no reasoning with a gun tard, they are so terrified of the world they cant imagine trying to live without them. Its funny, I know a lot of gun owners and no one has ever used one in self defense. But I know easily a dozen people who have been shot (some killed) or robbed at gunpoint by criminals with guns. Despite those daily occurances cowards still cant man up without a gun. Ask them how many school kids would need to get murdered and theyll tell you there is no amount that would dissuade them. Im a gun owner and ccw holder. Im one of rare ones who doesnt NEED a gun to feel like a man."
26794208241,"Youre angry about the NRA? Use that on banks, the defense industry, the EPA, the FDA. Not individual rights. Direct that somewhere useful. You are creating new NRA members every time you come out railing to abolish it. Dont you see the irony?"
26793948308,"&gt; Are you a member of a well-regulated militia? That is in no way an explanation, but Ill respond to it anyway. Technically, regulated under the [Militia Act of 1903](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_Act_of_1903), all able-bodied men between 17 and 45 can be considered reserve militia. That act was somewhat responsible to the formation of the [Civilian Marksmenship Program](http://www.odcmp.com/), of which I am a member. It does have requirements involving training to join. It was [created by congress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Marksmanship_Program) in 1903, and was formerly run by the US army. &gt; Absolutely countries like UK, Australia are safer Ehhhh.... Theres a reason people keep bringing up rape and assault. Its because youre more likely to be [assaulted in the UK than the US](http://www.nationmaster.com/country/us-united-states/cri-crime), [more likely to get raped in AUS,](http://www.nationmaster.com/country/au-austria/cri-crime\), and a bunch of other [not-so-fun](http://www.nationmaster.com/country/us-united-states/cri-crime) facts. At the end of the day, nowhere is safe from everything. We have more guns, but youre less likely to be assaulted in any other way. Also, those CDC numbers include suicide, and are therefore dishonest. The CDC wont publish numbers eliminating that number, because for a long time, the NRA pushed to disallow it. Again, fuck the NRA. &gt; ...to sell more guns at any cost. Look, the NRA does [not sell guns.](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/01/do-assault-weapons-sales-pay-nra-salaries/) any more than TV stations sell McDonalds food, and they [shy away from gun sales themselves.](http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/04/nra_great_american_outdoor_sho_1.html) They (NRA-ILA, that is) do, however, allow people to buy ratings, and they do donate money to politicians for favorable votes, they push for stupid restrictions, and their spokesperson is completely insane. Maybe lets not let politicians take money in exchange for votes anymore? Thatd solve a lot of problems all at once. Blaming the NRA for politicians behavior is like blaming McDonalds for people getting fat, or blaming the internet for goatse. It doesnt make a ton of sense. If youre going to hate the NRA, at least do it for reasons that are factual. As it stands, if the NRA says theyre absolutely not doing something, theyre likely not. If they dance around the issue, they unquestionably are. NRA members know that, which is why people who talk to the members usually have a hard time getting through to them. &gt; One person who votes based on NRA scorecards is one too many. Oh man, I cannot agree with you more on this. &gt; One of those very few things is taking down the NRA. Honestly, Bloomberg wont succeed at that. People like me might. People ask me why I havent joined the NRA, and I tell them in great detail. Im also not spouting off things that arent true (NRA SELLS GUNS TO BABBY WARGLEBARGLE) when I talk to them. Its way easier to have a conversation with someone when you dont tell them things that they know are incorrect. The sad part is this: I cant find a PAC regarding gun issues that isnt politically biased and all fucked up. Ive thought about joining the [pink pistols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Pistols), even though Im straight, but I cant find any records of their actions. If you keep up the anger when talking to people about guns, you wont change anything. Accuse someone enough of being a thoughtless single-issue voter, they might become one."

This is how much they hate the ACA as is. http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/house-has-now-voted-46-times-to-repeal-or-dismantle-obamacare You can also add the fact that the red states didnt set up online state ACA registries like they were supposed to. Which, famously overburdened the federal site. http://crooksandliars.com/jon-perr/health-insurance-coverage-gap-coming-red-states Their dedication to derail healthcare reform is not in question. They are not going to welcome reasonable debate on the issue so they are always going to vote lock-step. Thats the problem. Now, since a single-payer bill was not passed its difficult to see how they would have worked to sabotage its implementation. But as they clearly demonstrated with the ACA, they would use every resource they have to bring it down. There is simply ways to affect laws after the votes have been made. They have demonstrated that too well. But let me explain why even the lack of votes is still their fault. Democrats that like insurance lobby money may vote the other way if the insurance lobby disapproved of single-payer, and likely yes, they would disapprove. However, votes lost by those Democrats would never be picked up on the Republican side simply because of their irrational lock-step voting. They are not using reason. They are not open to debate.

Now if you could convince Republicans to realize that Hey, maybe letting our countrymen afford food and medical care is a GOOD thing then maybe I would change my opinion on why they are the reason America is turning into a fascist third world country. I would also like to know how lock-step the Democrats would have been in single-payer scenario, but such is life."

Democrats tried to compromise, with the patience and virtue of saints, and removed portions of the bill in making such compromises. They continued to make cuts until they finally realized that Republicans had no interest in compromise, but were just pretending, to stall the legislation further and remove its most progressive parts. The points you make dont prove they arent at fault for the removal of single-payer, it proves that they all lied when they told Democrats their approval could be won by making particular cuts. EDIT: Basically Democrats tried to pass the bill with bi-partisanship, except theyre really bad hagglers and also quite gullible."

In the end, you cannot blame the text of the law on a group that refused to go along with it. They passed the law knowing that there would be zero republican votes, their failure to make changes before they put it up for a vote rests solely on themselves. The republicans may have run out the play clock, that doesnt mean the democrats have any excuse for making their final play an intentional touchback."
26942684355,"&gt; The problem is political. Single payer could have been passed if not for the Republicans. Ive been seeing this statement a lot lately. Care to explain how the republicans stopped the ACA, a bill that exactly zero of them voted for, from including Single Payer? Here is a bit from Wikipedia on the subject. *Senate:* &gt;On December 23, the Senate voted 60¨C39 to end debate on the bill: a cloture vote to end the filibuster by opponents. The bill then passed by a vote of 60¨C39 on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for, and **all Republicans voting against (except for Jim Bunning, who did not vote).** *Interesting side note, the vote was pushed through just in time.* &gt;Several weeks after the vote, on January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Senate in a special election to replace the late Ted Kennedy, having camp"

Yes, it is well established that republicans are against the ACA, they have been since the beginning of this whole debacle started in 2009. **That has nothing to do with single payer.** &gt;You can also add the fact that the red states didnt set up online state ACA registries like they were supposed to. Which, famously overburdened the federal site. This is a surprise how? Didnt all those red states say they they were not going to set up their own exchange, from the beginning. **Once again, nothing to do with single payer.** &gt;But let me explain why even the lack of votes is still their fault.

However, votes lost by those Democrats would never be picked up on the Republican side simply because of their irrational lock-step voting. Just let me understand you correctly. Because some Democrats are corrupt (OK, just about every one of the 535) and would be afraid to vote for single payer, the fault lies with republicans that wouldnt support the ACA, much less single payer. **Is this seriously your logic?** &gt;They are not using reason. They are not open to debate. They do not care for their constituents and openly lie to them about the provisions of the ACA. **What they do after the fact has nothing to do with them not voting for the ACA in the first place.** Are you suggesting that there was any one person that understood the scope and all the benefits and pitfalls of the ACA? The law is made up of over 200k words, it references numerous other laws and codes, it makes hundreds of modifications to other laws and codes and there was little in the way of opportunity to read, much less understand the ACA. The democrats voted for the ACA on faith alone, relying on what their leadership was telling them what was in the bill. Had it not been for the upcoming supermajority loss, the democrats may have had time to understand what they were getting into. The fact of the matter is that the window of opportunity was closing and the democrats just wanted to pass anything they could claim as a victory and hope to make modifications down the road when it was too late to fight it. &gt;they are the reason America is turning into a fascist third world country. I would encourage your to become more familiar with words such as fascism before applying the label to a specific party. You may find that such a label applies equally well if not better to the party you are rooting for."
26972623956,"&gt; The high net worth individuals are going to drastically skew this statistic, and then you turn around and average their holdings over the entire population of retired persons? For example, the 6 owners of Walmart control more wealth than the bottom 40% of the country combined... you cant just average that shit out like you are doing, its a flat out lie. I am skeptical of where they came up with the 40% figure. Net worth is the sum of assets and liabilities. From my research on official numbers, income is based on age, education, race, and gender. It seems that the academic economic articles I have access to link wealth and income together. What I mean by this is if you are in the bottom 40% of income earners then your net worth is attached to this. I am seeing mostly negative with this, but it is not a proper estimate of the true bottom 40% considering income, age, education, race, and gender are not organized in an appropriate manner. Based on statistics from the BLS, it would seem people with a bachelors degree have a median net worth of $142,518. The following median values compared with education should help explain why there is net worth disparity; No High School Diploma/Equivalent-$7,270, High School Graduate $42,223, Some College-No Degree $43,580, Associates Degree $58,861, and then college as stated previously. Based on these values wealth is concentrated with those who have earned at least a bachelors degree. This makes sense considering in 2012 30% of Americans held at least this degree. If you study the numbers as I have, you should see that net worth is based on education and wealth increases with age. As for the example you gave with Walmart, it does not seem ethical to use a $150 billion fortune on paper based on equity to show that somehow the poor are being punished. What should we do to high net worth individuals like the Waltons to bring the poor to a more affluent position? Obviously education and maturity will account for a large part of it, but what do we do about the 40 year old McDonalds worker or the 35 year old cashier at Walmart? I will agree that minimum wage should be integrated with the poverty level plus 15% and be tax exempt. &gt; Except for statistics that actually show 44% of the elderly would be in poverty without social security, and on average SS accounts for two-thirds of income for its elderly beneficiaries. The top 0.1% control HALF of all capital gains. Your fun with numbers is rubbish. Pretending the market and the federal reserves control over inflation is anything but a tax on the poor and a control of wealth is insanity. Social security pays out $14,760 before taxes. Why are we not thinking of ways to get out of this ponzi scheme? I would be much more comfortable investing my money where my returns would be much greater. Wouldnt you like to build your own wealth that you could give to your children and pass it down to your progeny? Poverty is based on income and not wealth. I am unsure of how accurate the 44% number is as well. If that is true then a lot of people did not use their incomes wisely or invested poorly. Also, do not event say that the top 0.1% control half of all capital gains. That is a completely misguided figure. Capital gains is the profit after selling a stock, bond, or some other security. Obviously the top 0.1% will move capital around in great amounts considering a large number of them. Also, you say 0.1% but you do not specifically state whether this is income or wealth. Tom cruise earned over $75 million (income) for his role in Mission Impossible III yet he is not part of the 0.1% wealth even though he is part of the top 0.1% of income earners when he plays in a movie. If you at all want to be legitimate you need to be specific and analyze outside of the talking points. I used to buy into the things you say but then I went to school to study economics and I was able to analyze better than I used to. Learn to do so yourself."
26972707229,"... So what I got from that is everyone else has the numbers wrong, and you have them right. I would say you are only analyzing what you choose too. Clearly someone with an economics degree would have a vested interest in making the system inaccessible to those who dont, or at least controlling the perception of it. But hey, Id never say dont go to college... I just find it somewhat sad that were more educated than ever, and yet were benefiting less than ever from it as a whole. Be wary of the $1.2 trillion dollar loan racket that theyre running on it too. Apparently Walmarts wealth is some mystical paper based equity that doesnt exist in real life. http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/08/one-wisconsin-now/just-how-wealthy-wal-mart-walton-family/ Poverty is measured by earnings, unemployment compensation, workers compensation, Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, public assistance, veterans payments, survivor benefits, pension or retirement income, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, income from estates, trusts, educational assistance, alimony, child support, assistance from outside the household, and other miscellaneous sources. A little more than income... http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/measure.html &gt; do not event say that the top 0.1% control half of all capital gains. I did and you can. Its just a calculation of the capital gains on the sale of shares or property after 1 year http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2011/11/20/the-top-0-1-of-the-nation-earn-half-of-all-capital-gains/ &gt;Obviously the top 0.1% will move capital around in great amounts considering a large number of them. A large number of what? The large number of stocks and complete control of the wealth they own? Fricken duh. More than half of Americans arent even in the stock market. They are the poor smucks spending a quarter of their life paying down debt and providing the foundation so CEOs can make $7,000 an hour while bribing our politicians. &gt;. If that is true then a lot of people did not use their incomes wisely or invested poorly. No shit they didnt. That requires education and excess income to put into what many consider a huge risk that will be wiped away the next time the banks lose a gamble with public money. "

26978022409,"&gt;Your statement that social security has cost the country nothing is certifiably mostly false This article is missing an important fact. It points to 2010 and 2011 as years when social security ran a deficit but fails to point out that it is because the social security tax was temporarily lowered. If politicians would just stop fucking with social security it would remain solvent forever. &gt;Downsides include how most people paying into the program today probably wont get their benefits when they grow up This is purely because of the government borrowing from social security. It has nothing to do with social security itself. &gt;and the toll it had on the economy since all those payroll tax dollars would have otherwise went to the pockets of the workers How good exactly would tens of thousands of newly homeless elderly people be for the economy? Its funny how conservatives will use more money in workers pockets as an argument for helping the economy here even though it entirely contradicts every other economic argument they have. &gt;Also youre acting like the amount of money you pay into social security is how much you get back. In reality, most old people today will be getting more than they paid into it Thats the way an investment is supposed to work. Also, your employer pays half, so obviously you get more than you paid. &gt;nd also more than they need in a lot of cases (something kinda messed up about a poor kid paying payroll taxes to fund a wealthy octogenarians lifestyle, means-test that bitch). This is silly, theres a cap on social security, so it wont be funding anyones wealthy lifestyle. The poor kid is paying into it so that he wont become a homeless old man. "

But when someone makes a numeric statement like $Y budget hole or X jobs created if Politifact cant understand the numbers, their truthometer is faulty. "

However, were going to take money from all states for education and give it back only to those states that do what we want. I believe Nevada, for example, was the last state to get oon board with NCLB. For a llong time they paid into it but the money went back to other states because they refused to tow the line. Its bullshit maneuvers like that that upset Repubs. If jts not within the Federal governments authority then they shouldnt be able to extort states into doing what they want. Edit: If your point was how much Bush expanded those areas, I wont argue with you. Bush wasnt just a bad president. He was a terrible Republican as well.

26725252447,"&gt; The scandal is whether or not the Obama administration covered it up in order to keep this edge in the Presidential race. No. It isnt. That isnt even a question anymore.

Some reporter claimed that he had seen emails that said otherwise, but as weve just learned that wasnt true. But besides that, besides the facts that disprove the *conspiracy*, the accusation that the president was trying to downplay terrorism to win the election doesnt make any logical sense. Benghazi was attacked **two months** before the election, and the Obama administration confirmed it was a terrorist attack [on Sept 19th](http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/19/obama_official_benghazi_was_a_terrorist_attack) A full **48 days before the election**. It makes no logical sense that would somehow be a boon to his election. What is the political advantage of delaying confirmation by a week? Every statement that was made by Rice on those sunday talk shows was prefaced with: &gt; Our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present - &gt; Well wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but thats the best information we have at present.

When will we have a system that truly works for the people? Enough of this political bullshit. Please explain to me in detail how it is political bullshit to say: We have an ongoing investigation on the matter, right now, our best guess is X. Then after the investigation concludes to say: Our initial assessment was incorrect, it was Y. What you are implicitly arguing is that the CIA should not have the authority to filter what information is broadcast to the world from its active investigations. I would like to hear a specific justification for this opinion, and why its appropriate for police to decline information during an ongoing investigation, but not appropriate for the CIA. --- &gt; Oh, and what is happening with the IRS now is very similar to what Nixon was doing.

26979446047,"&gt;Yes it does. Workers whos income is reported via W2. Not students. Not retirees. Student-aged who work, is my point. I suppose that was unclear. I definitely filed a W2 working through college. And theres no way that graph is excluding student-aged workers with that total work-force number. &gt;According to the BLS, out of all teenagers in the US, on 4.5 million total are employed at any pay rate. That represents less than 10% of the total number of people earning less than minimum wage annually. Teenagers, age 16-19, is not the entire demographic I refer to. College age easily extends to 22-23. Bureau of Labour Statistics refers to youth as 16-24, which Id argue is still young enough for the point. Using the definition I used originally, and not excluding the entirety of college age students, that number rises to [19.7 million employed between the ages of 16-24 during july 2013](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/youth.pdf). Using your numbers that would equate to approximately ~40-50% making less than minimum, not 10%. &gt;If you make an assertion you have to back it up with data. The average age of a fast food worker is 29. Many, not most. Posting something like you did, saying 32% of workers earn less than annual minimum, without differentiating *at all* between age groups, is misleading. Because that number falls to 19% (still too high but not near as bad as 32) when you account for youth, who are to be expected working in the crappy sub-minimum jobs/minimum jobs. I already acknowledged that there are people who have the issue of both being older, and having shit happen (or nothing good happening) that leads to them being in crappy jobs. And that number is too high, but thats a different discussion. &gt;In order to retire, you must save for retirement throughout your career. People need to always be saving for retirement. It is (literally) exponentially better to start saving for retirement at a younger age. Of course, but unless we are expecting these youth to be stuck in shitty minimum wage jobs, which is possible for a fair amount, relying solely on savings from &lt;$20,000 isnt going to do much, even including social security. Especially accounting for any increase in wage, as small as they would be, over the course of their working careers (I do not see someone starting at ~18 not improving their income in at least a mediocre fashion over their working life, nor do I see them keeping the same job). &gt;Its also an issue for the people who cant earn a decent living their entire lives. The average retirement saving is only $43,797, and 36% of retirees have nothing saved for retirement. I specifically said ...cant find work/better jobs. Why did you ignore that? I have no issue with the fact that wages are too low for too many people, but I have issue with using statistics in minimum wage discussions that do not take into account the people who are expected to make minimum; the untrained, inexperienced youth (the fact that its pathetically low for some areas is a different discussion, as well). Its similar to using jobs created without taking into account what types of jobs, or income growth without taking into account who obtained said income. Theyre statistics that are too broad to be appplicable for the discussion and using them in this fashion is more about pushing a view, not supporting an argument. Saw it all the time in economic articles/essays. "

Democrats need a united front on this or theyll lose a large portion of support come next election. There are some of us who voted for Obama because he pretended to be anti-patriot act."
26770737435,People support anything when their side is in office. Everything is a victory and evidence of their teams superiority.
26770988945,"With the broad possibility of blackmail of media groups tempered with the chilling effect of the domestic spying program, I decline to believe anything that the major media produces in the way of stories and/or polls. About this poll; sorry, not buying it. Fraudulent polls are designed to create doubt in peoples minds and make them feel as if they are on the edge of a general belief. I have well over 50 progressive acquaintances and about the same number of moderate conservatives - and they are *all* completely incensed over this. "

26770913811,"And if there was a Republican Administration in power when this stuff broke, the poll numbers would be opposite. The sports team mentality that plays into politics is precisely why *nothing ever changes,* regardless of which party is in power.

So the same terrorists who plan to harm innocent Americans and their freedom worldwide would be coddled, if we followed the Democrat plan. "

26770300783,"The reverse was true during the Bush years over warrantless wiretaps. This same poll also seems to be a stunning difference in comparison to the ones that Gallup and Pew released last week which showed Americans overwhelmingly in favor of spying, whereas this poll seems more evenly split. Ive never heard of this pollster before, though, and at least Pew tends to have solid polls (not so much Gallup in recent years), so I think its still not a given the way the public as a whole leans on the issue, but it does seem like partisanship is motivating a great deal of the Democratic base on this topic."

But Im also an academic researcher... maybe there are poorly educated Democrats Im not meeting in life that dont know much about government/political histories across the world and the value of our Constitution?

Why arent more people talking about this? EDIT: TL;DR: &gt; While not currently permitted under U.S. law, there are increasing calls for creating a more permissive environment for active network defense that allows companies not only to stabilize a situation but to take further steps, including actively retrieving stolen information, altering it within the intruders networks, or even destroying the information within an unauthorized network. Additional measures go further, including **photographing the hacker using his own systems camera, implanting malware in the hackers network, or even physically disabling or destroying the hackers own computer or network.** &gt; Additionally, software can be written that will allow only authorized users to open files containing valuable information. If an unauthorized person accesses the information, a range of actions might then occur. For example, the file could be rendered inaccessible and **the unauthorized users computer could be locked down, with instructions on how to contact law enforcement to get the password needed to unlock the account.** The definition of the word hacker covers IP theft, which includes those who share music, movies, etc. (Search for hacker in the article) More bullet points in comments: http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1h1hd0/proof_that_lobbyists_wanted_nsalike_spying/capyyqo People involved: ?

26770638552,"What the fuck, 58% of Dems? The fucks the matter with you guys?"
26770571101,Im not sure Democrats are clear on what theyre supporting. If the questions were rephrased to ask if people support widespread domestic surveillance without a warrant and that spying was being done by contractors with limited oversight I doubt seriously youd get 58 percent support. 
26770530397,I am one of the among 58%.

They dont actually care about the spying per se, just about the implications in future elections. Republicans see it as a way to win seats, while Dems are afraid it will lose them seats. This is also why Dems are distancing themselves from the President - Both voters and elected officials. Its more interesting with the Republican base though, because they actually dont see anything wrong with the methods, just who is doing it.

26770288665,I bet if you broke down support by conservative/liberal instead of republican/democrat the results would look quite different.

26770350262,Ask that same question 8 years ago when W was running things with Chertoff as the head of the NSA. 
26770355029,Lets call it even and remember that both a Democrat and Republican president presided over these programs presumably with full knowledge of their inner workings. 
26770359393,"I am NOT saying I support this program. I am saying that I think most of the people who hate it, are going waaaay to sinister on motives for why we keep it. My bet is we are using it to kick ass with state on state espionage and counter espionage. For every retard with a pipe bomb they smack down, they are catching or flipping operatives of other countries. I think there is a reason the international fallout was as big as it was. With PMs saying stuff like Irelands did. We can all scoff at the effectiveness of Prism to stop jihadis but my guess is its rolled a metric shit ton more of people looking to flip, sell secrets etc etc. Its been the European reaction that makes me think this. America has been hypocritical on tons of issues before, but rarely do we get full on called to the mat about them as we are now. There were massive protests about Iraq all over the globe but few leaders really got in Bushs face over Iraq. So why, with no protests and a pretty mild reaction globally within their own borders are the leaders seemingly so pissed? Why? Because Prism is all over the net. Theyve figured out just how much of their spy game we are tapped in to. If the system works as stated, amazing encryption wouldnt even be able to hide a spy because all it would do would be like seeing a nuclear weapon launch, a giant neon sign saying someone from this IP is up to something. "
26770366604,you mean to say that people that identify as republican and democrat are machines programmed to root for their team? im shocked.
26770374352,These numbers would be flipped if all this came out with a Republican in office. All these numbers are telling us is party affiliation. 
26770375787,Democrats blindly follow Obama even though he is the worst president we have ever had just like Republicans followed Bush no matter what when he was president (worst at the time). Why not Libertarian? Heaven forbid you actually break away from what those parties tell you to believe.
26770379066,"Many have been rightly arguing that this result says more about Republican partisan opposition to the Obama administration than it does opposition to the policy itself. But from that standpoint, Democrats under a Republican administration would oppose the policies just the same. These statements further a partisan divide when what it also means is that conservative and liberal perspectives on civil liberties are coming toward agreement on core constitutional values, in opposition to those authoritarian perspectives held by the center in both political parties. Any political movement that could force a change in these policies would need broad support across the populace. An organized left/right coalition in opposition to Democratic/Republican party control thus represents a real opportunity for change, the kind of opportunity Obama promised and yet squandered. This could be viewed as a Bernie Sanders/Ron Paul type ticket. Two men who would always hold divergent views on a range of political issues, and yet both hold similar core values on civil liberties. Libs and Cons need to start making tough choices over division versus unity, given the potential for tyranny this national security state apparatus portends. "

26771148301,"One thing to consider: Democrats are significantly more urban voters. Im an otherwise liberal democrat who generally supports broad anti-terror activities. I also ride the subway to my job, located in a major tourist destination. I cant think if another way to say this and I dont mean this in a negative way: I think its easier to oppose these programs when its not as likely to effect you in a positive way, just like the rich opposing universal healthcare. This is a common rationale amongst my friends, and Im willing to bet that between that, reassurance from reliable voices like Al Franken, and the modest checks and balances (FISA courts, Congressional input), most Democrats are willing to accept these programs as the balance between libery and security in the early 21st century. Obviously caveats apply (why/how did the Boston bombers get through this? How did a loose cannon like Snowden get a job?) The NSA story is not new, and its been in the public domain for years even if not well covered or paid much attention to. The president intends to curtail the AUMF and the Patriot Act. Theres a balance here, and Ill gladly accept President Obamas rationale here, particularly when I so strongly support other aspects of his platform. "
26771167181,"They dont support it because Obama is in the White House. They LOVED it under Bush, so all these polls actually reflect is that they are brand loyal, not policy loyal. And honestly, the same might be true for Dems."
26771310866,"This isnt a problem. Democrats are pro-big government. Something like Prism is totally in-line with what dems are supposed to be doing. Shit like this happens when their *only* opposition takes a train to crazy-town and stops acting according to their base. If the Republicans were doing their fucking jobs, the Democrats wouldnt be able to get away with this kind of shit. Instead, we get 40-ish attempts to repeal a fucking health-care bill, and a war on/against marriage/women/christanity that makes no fucking sense."

No mortgage payments. And Im thankful for what I have every day, because I am EXTREMELY lucky for my generation. Im doing swimmingly well compared to most people my age in that I own a house, two cars, can pay minimum payments on my student loans, and still have a few pennies left at the end of the month for savings."

I am sorry for your loss, and I am grateful for your husbands service. I truly am. But you are a victim of Roosevelts socialist agenda and propaganda. The numbers do not support your argument."
26935026769,Its an unconstitutional earned benefit.

26935162983,"When a household is entirely dependent on one member for income, the common practice is to get life insurance for that member. The exception tends to be if youre willing to go out and work for yourself. Whats odd here is your husbands age. These days, the youngest WWII vets are in their mid 80s, and low as social security payments are, its rare for an 85-year-old to have a job paying 20x. The average social security payment is ~$14,000 per year, so that puts his job well into the $200,000 range."

SS is a Ponzi scheme of income redistribution, perverted now by both parties into scaring elderly people into voting a certain way. And since many old people vote Republican (baby Jesus trumps all!), the party that would see your benefit stripped away, theres even more irony. Also, the income cap taxed for SS is around 110k. Income over that isnt taxed for SS, and thats the demographic that has enjoyed almost all of the prosperity and growth in wealth over the last 30 years. While the middle class is gutted. Tell me, how well do you think SS can do when the middle class that used to be able to support it is replaced with a large lower income class that makes less than $10 an hour? That math is pretty scary, dontcha think?"

26887690261,I dont understand how gerrymandering doesnt carry a significant jail sentence. How is it not purely election fraud?!
26887579756,You should finish that thought. Gerrymandering was only possible because of the GOP landslide at the state and local level in 2010. The GOP landslide at the state and local level in 2010 was made possible by the passage of the ACA without one single republican vote. TL;DR: Things happen for reasons.

For those who can afford insurance, the way the ACA redistributes the costs of health insurance is unfair, e.g. [forcing men to pay maternity coverage,](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/does-obamas-health-care-law-make-men-pay-for-maternity-care-breaking-down-the-facts/2013/10/31/5db80b90-424a-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html) or by [forcing healthy/young people who make responsible personal health decisions to pay increased premiums above what they would otherwise be charged to subsidize those who have made poor health decisions,](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=0da040a5-45b1-415a-85a2-dee11befb911) like the obese etc. 2. [An unprecedented peace-time expansion in government power, that sets a disturbing precedent.](http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/08/the-individual-mandate-an-unprecedented-expansion-of-federal-power/) Whereas penalty-enforced mandates to purchase products from a private business had only previously applied to elective activity (e.g. if you drive on public roads, you need insurance, etc.), the only condition to being subject to the ACA mandate is *being alive*. There isnt a convenient way to opt out of this, and opens the doors for other corporations to lobby to get the public to buy their product at the federal level. 3. [For people who have an Originalist view of the Constitution,](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/originalism-vs-obamacare/) the ACA is unconstitutional and a violation of the rule of law which many people like. 4. [It cuts Medicare to a certain degree,](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/19/tom-cotton/sen-mark-pryor-cut-medicare-pay-obamacare-says-rep/) which is alleged to not necessarily have any negative impact due to the way certain provisions of the ACA fill in the gap, but people dont like the idea of losing control over the medicare theyve felt theyve earned. [People also liked the medicare advantage programs which are now nonviable due to the ACA.](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/obamacare-cuts-bite-medicare-advantage-225400802.html) 5. The economic and regulatory effects of the ACA are [to reduce competition in many markets](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/29/trouble-for-obamacare-in-new-hampshire/), which serves to boost insurance company monopoly power. And with the mandate, people cant opt out. 6. People like the privacy of their medical records, and people worry that [the incentives to report data to the government in the ACA](http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/Stage2_MeaningfulUseSpecSheet_TableContents_EPs.pdf ) could lead to [abuses observed in other similar systems,](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/11/28/disabled_woman_denied_entry_to_us_after_agent_cites_supposedly_private_medical_details.html), or are just uncomfortable in general, like the naked body scanners at airports. 7. If any of a laundry list of delicate, tendentious assumptions are not met, [the ACA will increase the deficit and national debt.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/28/news/economy/obamacare-deficits/) 8. [The ACA intends to flood the healthcare market with millions of new consumers (increase demand), but does nothing to alleviate the healthcare *supply* issues (e.g. the doctor shortage),](http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/02/health/obamacare-doctor-shortage/) thus with demand increasing and the supply staying the same or shrinking, prices are going to rise more than they otherwise would. 9. In order to cut prices down as much as possible to still have prices that appeal to consumers, insurance companies (since its now illegal to trim benefits now mandated) [must decrease the size of their networks to compensate.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/14/news/economy/obamacare-doctors/) People are going to lose access or their doctors. 10. [The ACA codifies taxpayer bailouts of private insurance corporations](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/us/politics/insurers-are-offered-assistance-for-losses.html) in an even more streamlined manner than the Wall Street bailouts, which many people would rather not do. 11. Because employer plans dont get the same government subsidy support as individual exchange plans, [companies will either be unable to afford, or will have an economic incentive to drop employee healthcare plans.](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304795804579097422592424860) 12.

The Independent Payment Advisory board (a.k.a. the death panel which will ration treatment for medicare, etc.) [is practically unaccountable to public pressure or democracy, and sets awful legal/democratic precedents by restricting the ways in which the laws/rulings can be overturned.](http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/302876/ipab-obamacare-s-super-legislature-michael-f-cannon) 14. It gives uncollected bureaucracies shadow legislative powers unprecedented in American history, [which is responsible for drafting 5x more pages of effective U.S. law (*so far*) than even the immense size of the ACA.](http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/16786-obamacare-brings-about-massive-increase-in-regulations) It also creates a regulation minefield for businesses/job creators. 15. [In many cases, to avoid employer healthcare mandates, businesses are cutting employees or employee work hours (implicit pay cut) and hiring full time employees less.](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101196459) 16. For those who like strong worker unions, [the reinsurance fee mandated by the ACA will financially strain or bankrupt union healthcare plans](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/15/unions-poised-score-one-year-reprieve-obamacare-ta/) Thus, it also disincentives many people from joining unions. 17. [The contraception mandate would force many people (employers) to pay money towards healthcare plans, that in their view, fund murder or immoral behavior.](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/26/politics/obamacare-court/) 18.

[The ACA mandates deep cuts medicaid and medicare compensation for doctors, which only decreases access for those already enrolled in those programs and limits how many doctors accept these patients or the quantity they will accept.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillmatthews/2013/12/02/doctors-facing-a-24-pay-cut-in-both-medicare-and-medicaid-reimbursements/) It aggravates the access problems these programs already have. 20. [The ACA will leave 30 million Americans uninsured.](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/cbo-obamacare-will-leave-30-million-uninsured). 21.

[Most Americans are within the 400% of the poverty line that will get new subsidy money from the government or will be on Medicaid,](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/population-up-to-400-fpl/) possibly making government dependency worse and giving people bad incentives. 23.

27129472397,"Yeah, I threw that in because Im not an unconditional Obama supporter by any means. I definitely feel like a lot of other young democrats that, through the short view of things at least, his presidency has not lived up to our expectations (for a lot of the reasons I outlined above). I didnt want someone to come say well there is x, y, and z that Obama could have done something about and didnt like I didnt know that already."
27129300636,"I really dont think its about that at all. I genuinely believe that Obama was an authentic guy, and he really believed that he could effect change. But the political reality in DC is that while the President *can* technically do things outside of Congress, doing that ensures that Congress will not be amenable toward working with the President on their common grounds first. So what tends to happen is the President and Congress work on common issues first (which may not be very many), and small incremental changes are made to the status quo. That said, Obama has realized there is very little that he is going to get help from Congress on, so he *is* leveraging his executive power to do things like raise the minimum wage for federal contractors. But overall, those are also weak reforms that can be easily reversed by the next executive, whoever that is. (Oh, except drones, lack of meaningful Wall Street reform, NSA spying on Americans, record number of deportations, etc. That stuff doesnt count..........)"
27129368603,"I agree with the majority of this post but I dont know that the last line is completely fair. Granted up front that Obamas failure to rein in the NSA is a broken promise and something that should be held against him and his legacy. On the other hand, he has both proposed and pushed for Wall Street reform on several [fronts](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/422/create-new-financial-regulations/). Candidate Obama did not come out against [drone strikes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/05/john-fleming/should-obama-apologize-policy-shift-drone-strikes-/). And while he has set records for his number of deportations he never promised to stop deporting people who broke the law, only to push for immigration reform to change the law, something he has done on several high profile occasions, even taking major heat for instituting a diluted form of the dream act through Executive order."

26866339985,Wow. Dont get upset. The statement that the us is not every other country is a fact. I didnt say it was better... I said it was not the same. we have certain unique issues in our legal system that need to be resolved 
26866245202,"People always make this point but dont examine the motivation behind it, which is essentially a profit motive. Efficiency of a company does not = reduced cost to consumers. The profit motive in the medical industry is why costs are so inflated. So what is the proposed alternative or counter-pressure to balance that out? The only decently supported argument Ive heard is the public option that provides a counter pressure to inflating costs because of their bargaining power. There hasnt been any plan forwarded within congress that made any public arguments for eliminating privacy of hospitals billing practices, setting ceilings on allowable charges, etc... So what else is going to apply pressure to hospitals and the like to push back on suppliers that inflate the costs because they have 0 consumers to answer to? As much as conservative principles decry any tampering with an open market, we dont even have an open market with healthcare to begin with. Were all bearing the burden of doctor pay, privatized hospitals, insurance and medical suppliers who are in a closed loop with one another. So Obamacare is not an optimal solution, but what are the alternatives that have been seriously proposed within government? "
26866224559,"The US is not every other developed country in the world. Insurance companies are FAR from the only problem in our health care system. Just swapping out insurance doesnt make costs magically drop. Notice, the public expenditure on health is already higher han most countries total expenditure.

26866346697,Did you read it? They ignored a bunch of costs because it falls under other branches of government and double or tripled the estimate for private insurance.

Not to mention I would not consider Justice Scalia an Originalist. Justice Thomas, I think, is much closer to an originalist.

The first part encourages the longterm investment in Wisconsin, not to mention generally longterm profits is severally eroded by inflation and capital gains on longterm does not take this into account. The short term encourages the churning of cash and this roll over effects overall robustness of business as profits arent cashed out but plowed right back in. The tax breaks for manufacturing and employment are complementary to each other and discourages outsourcing and reward creating local jobs.

Im not trying to say its a brand new idea that the Conservatives have just thought up, but they are using it to influence how the election will turnout. This is similar to the proposed ideas to make every district reward its electoral vote independently of the rest of the state. Thats not a new idea, two states already award electoral votes to each candidate. But cherry-picking the states that would implement this (which would give the Republican Party a win in an election theyd lose the popular vote in) seems to fly in the face of democracy.

Yeah, many of them go Democrat in elections, those that dont usually dont have a sizable urban poor population so they are not germane to the discussion.

Many of the urban poor work multiple jobs (and yet are still poor due to the lack of a livable wage, supporting a large multigenerational family, or a drug or alcohol addiction used to deal with their crummy life) and so a lack of early voting means choosing between voting or getting in trouble at work, perhaps even fired.

26872260294,"All of these sound very similar to laws we already have in Germany. Except maybe for such modern and complicated stuff like the ballistic fingerprint database. But yes. You cant simply carry around a loaded gun, if you dont have a reason for it. Either a specific threat (e.g. being a courier for valuables) or hunting. You need a specific licence for both. And of course there are no military guns sold here or a secondary market. You cant just sell your gun to anyone. And we recently introduced legislation about gun storage security. If you want to shoot guns for sport, there are pretty severe restrictions on what you can buy, where you can store and how you can transport guns and ammo. And we also have a lot of guns in circulation in Germany. And also school shootings. But a **lot** less criminal activity involving guns. And, of course, less accidents. But I dont think the legislation makes such a huge difference on these things. And I also dont think the legislation is such a big deal. If you want to own a gun, you can still do so. Its not the end of the world. Its just different. And, in part, very sensible. If a country is not as developed as the US and Europe. These provisions are there to develope a legislation system similar to European countries as opposed to the US. Which could be useful. Not everything the UN does is about the US, you know? Actually very little is. The UN is mostly a tool for powerful countries to impose their will on less powerful countries (the US mostly get what they want). Instead of the other way around. And it is still preferable to the alternative. Because powerful countries will always impose their will on less powerful countries. The UN simply provides a structure for it. And lets the less powerful get a word in. So they can at least feel like they had a say. This is called diplomacy. And why do you believe any of these measures will make it past Congress? Isnt that the real unrealistic thing?"

They talk about the children... anyone whos not anti-gun therefore hates children.

Theres a leaked anti-gun [playbook](http://washingtonexaminer.com/democratic-anti-gun-guide-urged-using-trayvon-martins-death-to-hit-nra-guns/article/2533972) that spells out that this is their plan for passing anti-gun legislation. If the ISACS becomes an actual thing in the UN, it allows them to bring international pressure on the public as well. Talking about how the United Nations and the rest of the civilized world supports these laws can be a powerful piece of language. You could just as easily ask why ISACS and the UNATT even exist in the first place, then, if they are just non-binding papers with words on them.

26878329610,"&gt;Obamacare is literally his legacy. That is an utter falsehood. While the PPACA is certainly the Presidents landmark signature legislative achievement, there is much more to his legacy. * Before the end of his term the POTUS will issue a decision on the completion of the transnational portion of the Keystone XL pipeline, a crucial matter to environmentalist groups (Jim Hanson has called the exploitation of the Alberta tar fields game over for global climate change.) * The appointment of SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ELENA KAGEN. This judicial appointment will, quite obviously, effect SCOTUS decisions and express the legacy of POTUS Obama for *decades*. * The appointment of SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR (the first Hispanic SCOTUS justice, creating the potential for a first SCOTUS Chief Justice of Hispanic descent.) This judicial appointment will, quite obviously, effect SCOTUS decisions and express the legacy of POTUS Obama for *decades*. * The POTUS has made MANY other judicial appointments which can be viewed [HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Barack_Obama#Supreme_Court) * POTUS Obama is negotiating THE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. Anybody who has ever heard of NAFTA can understand that trade agreements have an impact long past a POTUS term. * In 2009 the Credit CARD Act passed congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law. Opponents of the law have blamed it for rising interest rates, while supporters of the law have noted dramatic reduction in repricing practices among major credit card providers. * The POTUS appointed the first woman to the office of US SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, the former Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano. (The impact of that administration on the legacy of POTUS is multifaceted and I will not offer an analysis of the same on that basis.) * The POTUS appointed the first African-American man, ERIC HOLDER, to the office of US ATTORNEY GENERAL. (The impact of that administration on the legacy of POTUS is multifaceted and I will not offer an analysis of the same on that basis.) * POTUS Obama has appointed numerous civil servants, some of which were historic in some way (e.g. first appointee from a special class as with ERIC HOLDER) * POTUS Barrack Obama signed into law the the AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This action was highly controversial politically, with opponents blaming the act for the rate of recovery and many other problems, meanwhile supporters of the action credit the stimulus with ensuring the recovery. * POTUS Obama signed into law the DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, the legacy of which cannot be assessed in full until the process of rule-writing is completed. * POTUS Obama (among many others) lobbied the SCOTUS successfully to nullify provisions of the DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT, the resultant decision was widely received as a victory for the POTUS and marriage equality activists. * Under POTUS Obama the policy of the US ARMED FORCES with respect to LGBT Americans serving (openly) was rolled back. This policy was colloquially referred to as Dont ask, Dont tell. This decision was widely received as a victory for marriage equality activists. * POTUS Obama has overseen the declassification numerous documents related to FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT and related SIGINT programs in response to media reports and unauthorized disclosures. * POTUS Obama has maintained the timeline established under the administration of POTUS GEORGE W. BUSH for the WITHDRAWAL OF US TROOPS FROM IRAQ * POTUS Obama ordered a raid on Abbatobad, Pakistan which resulted in the death of OSAMA BIN LADEN. This was seen as a violation of the sovereignty of the Pakistani state by the Pakistani public and the POTUS publicly admitted that relations with Pakistan suffered dramatically after the attack. The attack has been lauded by US media outlets and was the subject of a Hollywood feature film in 2012 (Zero Dark Thirty.) * POTUS Obama adopted and normalized facets of the BUSH DOCTRINE, especially regarding preemptive war. Under the POTUS, this adapted doctrine has been referred to as the JUST WAR DOCTRINE. POTUS Obama spoke about the JUST WAR DOCTRINE in his remarks to the Nobel Prize Committee which you can read [HERE](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-acceptance-nobel-peace-prize) * POTUS Obama expanded the use of UNMANNED VEHICLES IN US COMBAT OPERATIONS. The POTUS discusses the use of drones in his LANDMARK SPEECH AT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY which you can read [HERE](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university) and which you can view (it was interrupted and the POTUS did improvise some remarks which do not appear in the prepared transcript) [HERE, part 1/6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLF_LtqhHEE) * POTUS Obama has maintained operations at the GUANTANAMO BAY DETENTION CENTER, citing congressional obstruction. * POTUS Obama ordered US forces, in conjunction with coalition forces, into action during the LIBYAN CIVIL WAR (also called the LIBYAN REVOLUTION.) * POTUS Obama has prosecuted a more-or-less clandestine military action in SOMALIA, in conjunction with African Union forces. * POTUS Obama posed the question of intervention in SYRIA to congress in a reversal of historical norms. Phew. That was a lot. Ive doubtlessly missed a good number of significant actions and policies and I invite you, dear reader, to make note of any omissions that I should have included. Whether or not you consider any or some of these legacies as *positive* it should be obvious that the PPACA, however prominently it figures in this administration, is not the only legacy of this POTUS. **Edited for formatting.** **Addition, with gratitude to /u/TheVegetaMonologues** **Addition, with gratitude to /u/Boye** **Addition, with gratitude to /u/qwicksilfer** **Also, /u/demonshalo thinks that I should fuck myself with crooked stick and has his own list.

26878456181,"&gt;As a Canadian, I have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. If you ask specific questions I will be happy to try to help you understand anything that was unclear. &gt;Why doesnt the USA have socialized health care to take care of its own citizens when even 3rd world countries have better health care than you? Is this a question about Obamacare (PPACA)? Although there are subsidies involved and the medicare/aid rolls are set to expand, the PPACA does not set up what we generally are talking about when we say socialized healthcare outside of the US (single payer.) If you could clarify your question further I will be happy to try to help. To the spirit of your question: why dont we do those things that we ought to do? Well, we cant pass a fucking farm bill [(link)](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/306981-farm-bill-setback-opens-gop-to-attacks-about-ability-to-lead) so...the notion that we would pass major reform bills in practically any area of policy is currently untenable.

Just because people on medicare part D dont necessarily know that theyre benefiting from a legacy of the Bush Administration doesnt make it a falsehood to call Part D part of that legacy. So Obamacare is literally his legacy isnt, as far as I can tell, correct and I listed many more facets of his legacy in order to demonstrate that.

I strongly dissociate myself with implication of your comment (that the POTUS is motivated by racial animus.)"
26878395604,Keystone XL is game over for climate change? What about the hundreds of new Chinese coal factories and power plants?

26878426518,"&gt; POTUS Obama posed the question of intervention in SYRIA to congress in a reversal of historical norms. Yes but he did this only when the decision to intervene was going against him.

26878401288,"&gt;Several of the points listed here are just continuing the policies of Bush. Does that really count as Obamas legacy? Yes. &gt;I suppose you could say that doing nothing is in itself a legacy, but that seems deceptive to me. How do you reach that conclusion? &gt;I think of a legacy as something he personally did that significantly altered the course of the government. Nero famously played the fiddle as Rome burned, a legacy of inaction which altered the course of government. If legacy were only embodied in affirmative action then what shall we call the consequences of inaction when it has lasting impact?"

POTUS Obama signed into law the DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, the legacy of which cannot be assessed in full until the process of rule-writing is completed. (Again, counting our chickens before they hatch) 4. POTUS Obama has overseen the declassification numerous documents related to FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT and related SIGINT programs in response to media reports and unauthorized disclosures. (This happens constantly. stuff gets declassified, especially once everyone knows about it. How is this a legacy?) 5. POTUS Obama adopted and normalized facets of the BUSH DOCTRINE, especially regarding preemptive war. Under the POTUS, this adapted doctrine has been referred to as the JUST WAR DOCTRINE.

Obama aligns with the GOP to gain authority to go against the nations interests? Ridiculous. This isnt in the purview of the presidents role. They are handled by the Office of The United States Trade Representative. Also, considering we live in a world of multinational corporations, theres absolutely no controversy, since they stand to profit from each countrys marketplace in their own separate legal context. The United States only regulates what is sold based on FDA recommendations. Whatever drugs arent made here initially can be manufactured here once the drug in question is approved for sale. (This opens to a whole other discussion on international copyright and patent law) On March 4, a coalition of groups concerned about the anti-democratic investor-state provisions called for a public consulation because investor-state clauses in trade agreements threaten democratic principles and the national interest. Again, this is just not the way government interfaces with concerned parties. As with any court case, you have to prove actual damage done. The assertion of democratic principles being threatened is too vague to merit any attention from anyone. Public consultation? What does that even mean? Id also argue that trade relations are always in flux. Investor-state provisions merely enable companies to properly arbitrate issues that may arise with a foreign government. It gives them agency in court with government support, so that they can successfully navigate the legal system abroad. If youd rather not give pharma companies that kind of support (which is also given to foreign companies trying to settle disputes with the U.S. government), I guess you dont want that sort of stability and structure for when issues arise."
124798885,"http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/22avfp/why_is_the_obama_administration_trying_to_make/ Why is the Obama Administration trying to make drugs for sick people too expensive for them to afford, all around the world- while PRETENDING they want affordable health care? As I surf around the web at various web sites that deal with international trade issues and so called free trade agreements I am struck by the fact that the Obama Administration and the USTR (US Trade Representative) are playing hardball in at least a half dozen separate trade negotiations, trying to raise the prices of drugs such as to make drug companies maximum profits. These agreements all of which being bilateral or multilateral all apply to the US as well as to foreign nations. What they are doing is trying to block various measures which save countries prices on drugs. This has an unfortunate blow back effect on our own country. Let me give you some examples: ----------- https://www.citizen.org/documents/States-Letter-to-Kirk.pdf Here, representatives of numerous states complained of an ill conceived agenda to use trade policy to restrict foreign and domestic medicine pricing programs. ------ quote We call on you to renounce support for inclusion of a pharmaceutical pricing chapter in the TPP negotiations and prohibit any future use of trade agreements and pressures to push pharmaceutical pricing policies abroad that we do not follow here at home. As we have explained to you previously, U.S. federal government agencies and state governments negotiate drug prices in similar ways asforeign governments , and they pay similar prices. Some of the most important tools used by over 40 state Medicaid programs are open formularies known as Preferred Drug Lists (PDLs) . PDLs are substantially similar to the programs in other countries that USTR and industry criticize as unreasonable price controls. Two recent trade agreements, Australia and Korea, included pharmaceutical chapters that imposed restrictions on foreign programs . In each of these instances, state officials criticized the agreements as promoting new standards that, if applied to Medicaid and other state programs, would cripple our ability to control rapidly escalating medicine prices ------- See the problem? This policy has continued, as shown here. Now, having lost Democratic support for Fast Track Authority he seems to have allied his administration with the GOP and is trying to mount a stealth campaign to have power given to him to approve trade negotiations against the nations interests in secret. http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2014/01/obama-downplays-trade-authority-trans-pacific-partnership-fleeting-mention-doesnt-even-reference-rec.html On March 4, a coalition of groups concerned about the anti-democratic **investor-state** provisions called for a public consulation because investor-state clauses in trade agreements threaten democratic principles and the national interest. https://www.citizen.org/documents/letter_froman_public_consultation_investment.pdf See also: http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2013/11/38-million-retirees-say-no-to-a-trade-deal-that-would-make-medicine-more-expensive.html [Obamas Biggest Health Reform Blunder: How Big Pharmas Billy Tauzin conned the White House out of $76 billion](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/prescriptions/2009/08/obamas_biggest_health_reform_blunder.html). http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade http://www.citizen.org/investorcases .

27149501227,"There are legitimate reasons to question the BLMs actions at the Bundy and other ranches, but I havent seen any of them mentioned in the conservative press, or by conservative ideologues. My guess is this because like all media outlets they want something sensational that will allow them to pain Harry Reid as a bad guy and the truth is a bit more nuanced, but no less disturbing. First off, Bundy didnt just decide to stop paying the grazing fees cuz feds. The BLM were restricting his water and grazing rights, and were using the fees to buy out other ranchers. He felt they shouldnt be doing this and so started paying the fees to the state- which had no idea what to do with them, so stopped accepting them. The ostensible reason for restricting his grazing rights was for the desert tortoise, an endangered species which lives in the area. All the pro-environmental news sources have been touting that the US government determined that cattle ranching is destructive of the tortoises habitat. However, some quick research on my part turned up the following paper from the USGS which states &gt;Grazing by livestock has been implicated as a factor in decreasing populations of desert tortoises ... The effects of grazing on desert tortoises, however, have not been studied in a quanti?tative or scientifically rigorous manner https://www.fort.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/products/publications/2722/2722.pdf In other words, theyre basically guessing at this. Theres another paper from the University of Arizona which concludes that cattle grazing actually helps the tortoise: https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/rangelands/article/viewFile/10776/10049 &gt;The historical record shows that: &gt;1. Desert tortoises have coexisted with cattle for 300 years in California and Mexico and at least 100 years elsewhere. &gt;2. The highest tortoise densities known occurred at a time when overgrazing by livestock was the severest ever known. &gt;3. The fewer the cattle on a range, the fewer the number of tortoises. On the other hand, there are certain human activities which absolutely have been determined to damage the tortoises habitat and kill tortoises, namely the construction of solar plants. From wikipedia: &gt; Concerns about the impacts of the Ivanpah Solar thermal project led the developers to hire some 100 biologists and spend US$22 million caring for the tortoises on or near the site during construction.[19][20] Despite this, in a 2011 Revised Biological Assessment for the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, the Bureau of Land Management anticipated the loss or significant degradation of 3,520 acres of tortoise habitat and the harm of 57274 adult tortoises, 608 juveniles, and 236 eggs inside the work area, and 203 adult tortoises and 1,541 juvenile tortoises outside the work area. The BLM expects that most of the juvenile tortoises on the project will be killed.[21][22] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_tortoise This for the Ivanpah solar project, constructed from 2010-2014. There are a number of other solar projects in the area either prospective or under development, and keep in mind, in the desert 90 miles away might be next door. To that end, the BLM has created a set of Solar Exclusion Zones to compensate for solar development in the area: http://blmsolar.anl.gov/program/exclusion/ &gt;A page on the BLM website, since removed, listed the impacts of trespass cattle owned by Cliven Bundy ... Non-governmental organizations regional offsite-mitigation strategies are also delayed for the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoff The solar thing isnt the *only* complaint against Bundy by a long shot, but the BLM does have a history of harassing ranchers. From the court decision US v Hage: &gt; government officials ... entered into a literal, intentional conspiracy to deprive the Hages not only of their permits but also of their vested water rights. This behavior shocks the conscience of the Court and provides a sufficient basis for a finding of irreparable harm to support the injunction described at the end of this Order. http://www.r-calfusa.com/property_rights/130524FindingsOfFactAndConclusionsOfLaw.pdf So basically it looks like the BLM is taking land from ranchers and giving it to solar companies.

27034455526,"&gt;Dr. BRENNER: The concerns we have are actually twofold. One is that there are actually a lot of people who go through airport security many times. One group, of course, is airline pilots, another group is frequent fliers. A typical commercial airline pilot in this country goes through security anywhere from 200 to 400 times a year. So that means that the very small risk from an individual scan is multiplied by that number 200 or 300 times for a pilot, or for a frequent flier, in fact. Theres certainly frequent fliers who go through the security that many times in a year. &gt;I certainly would. Its hard to know what the logic is. I mean, I think the logic must be that the TSA believes both of them are safe and so theyre using both of these devices. But there is certainly not conclusive evidence but convincing evidence that there will be some cancers induced some time in the future by these X-ray devices. http://www.npr.org/2010/11/19/131447056/are-airport-scanners-safe &gt;As a ProPublica/PBS NewsHour investigation detailed earlier this month, X-ray body scanners use ionizing radiation, a form of energy that has been shown to damage DNA and cause cancer. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/europe-bans-x-ray-body-scanners/"
27034462469,Leading radiation experts agree that multiple low dosages are harmful and damage DNA. Going through and being bombarded by cosmic rays is unavoidable. These machines are avoidable.

27049167493,What are you talking about? The employer mandate only applies to 3.6% of businesses. 
27050211733,"Around 90 percent of firms with 50 or more employees offer health insurance today, and when you get up to 100 employees, coverage is essentially universal, Buchmueller said. So the mandate will be a binding constraint for a very small number of firms -- the small number of medium-sized firms (say 50 to 99 employees) that currently do not offer insurance and a few more in that size range that might be thinking of dropping coverage. Total number of workers is 78.5 million that fall into the category of businesses with 50+ employees. The total number of workers that fall outside that category is 143.4 million. The statistic of 72% of people that work for companies is pointless considering that self employment accounts for 112 million workers alone. Adding it all up, you have 35% of all employed individuals that could possibly be affected, but, as stated above, only 10% of those firms with 50 or more individuals do not offer coverage. I will give you the benefit of the doubt (because its talking about percentage of firms, and not percentage of employees) and say that 10% of all employees (not just firms) in this range dont have health care and would be subject to the employer mandate. So, youre looking at 7.8 million employees, roughly 4% of the working population. This is, indeed, making a mountain out of a mole hill.

26874205820,"Sensationalist headlines like this really polarize the issue. This is whats wrong with US politics. There can never be a level headed discussion about anything. Lets play devils advocate for a moment: **Suspend the debt limit until December 2014.** Conceptually, this is to allow enough time so they can build a better budget (one that will last for more than 12 months) **Delay Obamacare for a year.** OK, so I work in a small privately owned manufacturing business with about 500 employees and the affordable care act is going to cost us about $500,000-1M in FY2014 year because if you want to change your insurance policy at all you lose your grandfather status. Thats a huge monetary loss in a recovering economy. Its easy support the ACA until you realize it costs small/medium size businesses the ability to retain about 20 jobs each, those jobs have been removed from the economy, and those people HAD healthcare, a living wage, and disposable income. **Include tax reform measures along the lines of the Rep. Paul Ryan principles.** This is probably a bad idea, and I say probably because last time I checked there were no clearly outlines principles. Everyone claimed his budget didnt balance, so Im against it. **Agree to a slew of environmental issues: Approve the Keystone pipeline, kill EPA clean air and climate regulations, increase drilling.** I get that some hardliners dont like the Keystone pipeline, but its a pretty decent way to fight back against OPEC and ensure that the US Dollar continues to be the basis for global trade in an energy based economy. Furthermore, cheap energy means that our economy can recover faster, because people can afford gas, electricity, and the cost of production of almost everything will fall. Also, a lot of those EPA regulations probably dont do what you think they do (e.g., most natural gas companies are exempt to those regulations, gulf oil spills still happen, Oklahoma doesnt have vehicle inspections, etc.) **Approve regulatory reforms including the REINS Act, which would basically gut the executive authority to make any regulations.** Constitutionally, the executive branch doesnt have any authority to legislate (regulate, make laws, whatever you want to call it), so Im actually for this. If you want the executive branch to have the power to legislate, then you probably need to amend the constitution. **Implement spending cuts, including reforming retirement programs, the child tax credit (to prevent fraud), and, of course, ending Dodd-Frank. Reforming health spending, including tort reform.** We need to reform health spending. We spend more than any other post-industrial nation, right? Spending cuts are good. Have you seen the national debt? Retirement programs *may* need to be reformed. The child tax credit *may* need to be reformed. I dont know anything about the last two, so I wont comment. ________ Anyway, these issues need to be discussed in a public forum. They dont need to be preached, regurgitated, reduced to Orwellian sound bites, then circle jerked about. The Democratic party is not divine, and the Republican party is not evil. At the end of the day, they are just people, from opposite sides of the isle, trying to represent their constituency democratically. The extremist, vocal minority in each party always seems to rise to a position of leadership, which prevents any centrist cooperation from taking place in Congress. And, truth be had, articles like this only make the polarization worse by driving the constituency apart. &lt;/rant&gt; "

But that is the only GOP solution to anything: tax cuts. Nor does a family decide that they are going to stop feeding one of their kids to save money (spending cuts).

26993216823,"&gt;&gt;People losing hours is not an effect of ACA... Not true. The ACA says employers must offer health insurance coverage to their full-time employees and their eligible dependents or face a penalty. Because of this, some employers (AKA greater than one) are using this as an excuse to reduce employees hours to avoid this. It doesnt matter if its justified or not, it is still the ACAs fault to some extent. &gt;&gt;...the cancelled policies were cancelled because ACA made them illegal Pretty much, yes. &gt;&gt;pretty safe to assume that a policy made illegal by new legislation would be altered or cancelled Except this was the opposite of what he was implying, and even stating. He said that if you like your health care plan, youll be able to keep your health care plan. And this is completely not true. The implication was that old plans would not be touched; they would be grandfathered in. And it was set up to allow plans to be grandfathered in, which meant Even though these plans are illegal, you can keep them. However, this did not work out, as some of the restrictions to be grandfathered in were too strict. However, the insurance companies deserve blame here as well as the ACA. &gt;&gt;I havent seen a report of widespread premium increases based on actual numbers After looking it up, I will agree that this research is lacking.

EDIT: Dude, the article you referenced said most people who are on a individual healthcare plan already change there policy a lot. 4.8 percent change it before 44 months. So why would it matter that in seven years 100 percent of people who have INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE loose it, if everyone changes it before hand anyhow?"

Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan. &gt;How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population switched health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching... So, lets say conservatively 15% a year? 100% lose their health insurance (using the GOP definition) every seven years. "

And lets be real, how many people does this ACTUALLY affect? - Your second point. Is this necessarily a bad thing that my proverbial child can stay on my insurance longer? - Your third point.

Intelligence reports almost never land on someones desk cut and dry - its full of probables, likelihoods, and other words that are purposely unclear even behind the classified wall. What won out over this decades-long approach within intelligence was the political certainty within the White House that Iraq was a threat which needed to be handled. Thats what makes things far worse - its not that they knew they were lying, its that they truly believed in their heart of hearts that they were doing the right thing in a climate they saw clouded by ambiguous intelligence and chaotic geopolitics. Only Powell, White, and a few others even stopped to think and consider the possibility or option of **not** attacking but it was overruled by the certainty that this new military with massive contractor support could stop a bad man from doing a bad thing. They were at least partially right, but then we demand more out of our leaders."

27127187799,"Im a rabid liberal (at least now). But I dont think Bush did it for those reasons. I think Cheney saw an opportunity when he was asked to find someone to be his VP (Cheney ultimately picked himself). Rumsfeld and Rove both latched on as well. Because Bush was more charismatic than a garden snail (Turbo excluded) he was able to win over Gore. And by win I mean have things decided by the SCOTUS even though it is pretty much directly prohibited by the constitution AND there is reason to believe that there was voter fraud and other issues. But whatever, thats not my point. My point is - Bush got elected because he was who came out of the primaries. Cheney, Rumsfeld and Rove all latched onto him like diseased ticks. Ready to suck the motherfucker dry just to serve their own purpose. And they did just that. Now - Im not saying Bush didnt want to go into Iraq. He did. But for completely different reasons. And it was this particular issue that was the in for Cheney and Rumsfeld. Bush hated Saddam because Saddam tried to assassinate his father. During the exchange of office, Cheney allegedly requested a briefing on Iraq from the outgoing administration ([Source](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042700550.html)). It appeared that even before 9/11/2001 Bush had his sights set on Iraq. Or, at the very least, Cheney. Now heres where things get a little complicated. Bush ended up allying himself with people who felt that George H Bush should have gone in and overthrown Saddam during desert shield/storm. GHB knew then, and said since, that there was no clear exit strategy so he could not risk going in. He has since said that he did not agree with his sons actions. Rumsfeld and Cheney disagreed, but ultimately the first Bush knew better than to trust those guys. However, GWB wasnt as sharp. Perhaps it was because he was blinded by the assassination attempt of his father, or the way that the Clinton administration thought of Saddam (they both wanted Saddam out, but Clinton wasnt willing to go to war over it). Either way - Bush was easily convinced by Cheney and company to go into Iraq. Then 9/11 happened. This diverted their attention to afghanistan, because that was where everything pointed to. But even then, they started spinning lies about how there were terrorists who were linked to Iraq in on 9/11 (even though this has been found not to be the case). Cheney would go on to say things like that Iraq would have nuclear weapons within a year. Note, Cheney did this first. Others followed suit. Cheney, when looking back, seemed to have a stranglehold on the administration. He would do things without really clearing them because he had an authoritarian god complex going on. He seemed to think he knew how to protect everyone. Id even grant that he thought that he could kill two birds with one stone in Iraq. He could depose Saddam and since he knew best, obviously his company Halliburton would know how best to rebuild Iraq. Now, ultimately it is the presidents decision to go to war. But when youre constantly being fed lies by the people you trust the most, you dont go with your gut. Since his gut was that pig fucker over in Iraq tried to kill my dad he ended up siding with the war mongers. While he still is ultimately responsible, I dont think he did it with the intent for Cheney and others to profit off of. I think he was used to suit the goals of those who were doing the using, and this is even supported by evidence of a significant rift between Bush and Cheney both in the late part of his second term and since. So, while I think that Bush didnt do it maliciously, and Cheney had what he rationalized as the countrys best interest in mind, everything got skewed. But, Cheney, that man is downright evil. In my opinion, he beats Saddam on the scale of evil. Anyone who is willing to sell to an entire country a war they dont need because he knows best or wants to be the hero, then gets that wish, and lets it end up as a huge clusterfuck of dead soldiers and civilians (not to mention combatants who would likely never have turned to that life had we not invaded). He pretty much destroyed all of Iraq. At least Saddam only destroyed part of it. And Cheney had the added I fucked over the american people while doing it.

27126636738,he is absolutely wrong. Rand Paul is a batshit crazy moron like his father and he has the balls to blatantly lie and insult one of our nations greatest VPs of all time? 
27126656179,&gt;Im not a fan of Rand but hes right this time. My theory is that hes the one saying these things because it discredits the cause of accountability. Have a racist crackpot hijack the issue and it damages the credibility of the many non-idiots who also support it.
27126848219,Dubya paints awful paintings now.. and somehow his daughter is on the today show
27126948659,"Just to play devils advocate (because I agree with you pretty much all the way), they had been informed that the original intelligence suggesting Saddam had WMDs wasnt necessarily reliable, they had not been given any confirmation that the WMDs didnt exist. And to be fair, Saddam was known to have tried to obtain WMDs on a number of occasions. Still, as much as it was the right thing to do to remove Saddam and his heinous party from power in principle, the war was a giant sloppy mess really only intended to generate money/power for certain corporations and lobbies in the US and Europe."
27126953979,"There are tons of articles on this, but Dubya/Blair were informed by intelligence agents that there were no WMDs. http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/04/23/cia.iraq/ Beyond that, yeah Saddam sucked, but lots of leaders are equally horrible or worse. Do we start invading every sovereign country that has a leader our leaders dont like?"
27127004877,Source on other agents informing them? Source on Cheney not profiting? Provide a fact check link. The only thing I could find was this: http://www.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/they-lied-they-died.pdf 
27126995964,1) Factcheck.org already debunked this countless times. There was no way Cheney could have profited off of the Iraq war through Haliburton 2) They were also informed by *other* intelligence officials that Iraq *did* have WMDs. 
27127007875,&gt; That was 100% the point of the Iraq war. Not buying it. Cheney was just the VP. He had little power. 
27127027528,Ha! Okay... Do you really think Dubya was anything other than a puppet? Can you see his sparkling intellect reflected in his puppy portraits?
27127035003,Oh goodness... We know they were informed by intelligence agents that there were no WMDs. Of course Cheneys bribes were hidden. Cheney isnt stupid. There were no valid reasons to invade Iraq. 
27127026173,"Im not a fan of Rand and hes even more wrong this time. Cheney/Dubya/Blair all thought WMDs existed, despite some dissenting voices in the intelligence agencies. And there were numerous other reasons we went, not just for WMDs. We didnt get their oil or anything. And Cheney had no interest in Haliburton. "
27127037450,People always issue this disclaimer before agreeing with anything the Paul family says. Its because theyre afraid of Obama supporters and the SJW-mafia giving them the scarlet letter for agreeing. We will have the same type of bad leadership until people can grow some balls and see past their little button-issues long enough to vote for a candidate like Rand.
27127048812,"Why would we want a bunch of fake libertarians who think freedom is only for straight, white men?"
27127047732,"Yeah, they were informed of that before they fucking invaded. "
27127049587,people will believe anything these days...
27127052811,"Yep, like believing Cheney thought there were WMDs."
27127060369,Just because wmds was the pretext doesnt mean that the only reason for the war was personal profit. Just saying. ..
27127078859,"Oh, I agree that it doesnt automatically mean that. However, when WMDs were basically the only excuse and all evidence points to all the death and destruction being purely for profit, its pretty silly to write it off."
27127133357,"Heres the thing, Cheney isnt an ordinary guy. He went directly from running Americas military industrial complex to running America and immediately starting two wars, at least one for entirely made up reasons. "
27127122732,"Im sorry but I dont buy it. I know it is fun to reduce Cheney to some kind of The Penguin evil criminal mastermind but I think it is far more likely that he is an ordinary man whos view is skewed by workings for companies that are involved in wars. You are constantly telling yourself that what you do matters, and that then shapes your worldview when events like 9/11 happen. It makes you believe that the American Army is a force for Good and that it is your duty to remove as many bad guys from the world as possible. It is never a matter of simple greed - people are just way too good at rationalizing for that to be the case."

26972716620,"Preemptive responses to the comments that come up: **Why is income inequality bad for the economy?** The economy functions when goods and services are produced and sold. The more goods and services are produced and sold, the healthier the economy is. Capitalism is generally considered a good thing because it encourages competition to make better goods and services. The wealthier will spend more money than the middle class who will spend more money than the poor, and thats fine as long as money is efficiently circulated. If income inequality gets to the levels it is at now, a very large percentage of the population will have little to no spending power and have to go into debt. Those at the top will have so much money that they are literally unable to spend (there are only so many cars, planes, vacations you can buy). So overall spending in the economy will go down, less goods and services will be produced, and the economy will be hurt. Now why was the economy seemingly functioning just fine before the recession? The poor and middle class had very little income, and had to go into debt to keep up their previous levels of spending. The rich had so much money they couldnt spend, that it was all funneled into savings and investment. People had a lot of incentive to borrow money, banks had a lot of incentive to lend money --&gt; high risk speculative investments, subprime mortgage rates, people encouraged to borrow against their houses, false AAA ratings --&gt; CRISIS. Now the problem is out in the open, the coping mechanisms are gone, and the economy isnt going to fully recover until these underlying problems are solved. The [last time that income inequality was this high](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/cassidy_01.jpg) was in 1928 right before the stock market crashed and caused the Great Depression. **What can be done about it?** Many minor policy changes will help. Raise minimum wage so that anyone living in this country can have a decent standard of living. That doesnt mean that managers shouldnt be earning more, or that CEOs shouldnt be earning significantly more. Increasing taxes on the rich is also not as dramatic as it sounds. There was a [90% marginal tax rate on the highest income bracket for a long time] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Historical_Mariginal_Tax_Rate_for_Highest_and_Lowest_Income_Earners.jpg) in the United States. Its important to understand what marginal tax means - 90% tax for income over $10 million for someone who makes $12 million would mean that only $2 million is taxed at that rate not the whole $12 million. And then there are capital gains that arent taxed at all for no reason. In general, theres a need to reform the tax code because the lawyers of multimillionaires are able to use loopholes to keep most of the money from being taxed at all. **What can I do about it?** Get educated and educate others! Its very easy to become misinformed about topics like this, especially with the current state of our media. People like Robert Reich have been pointing out this income inequality problem for a long time, but nobody paid attention until after the recession. Watch [this movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9REdcxfie3M) or read one of his books - Supercapitlism or Beyond Outrage."
26972635086,"People keep focusing on jobs when they really mean income. Income is why we sell the best years of our life anyway, not for some feeling of duty to work. Do we feel the same about people that literally do no work at all, but have plenty of money to survive? Nope. Would it be so bad if people had enough income to survive, but only worked 20-30 hours a week? Nope. Lets stop focusing on our work itself and start focusing on the reason why we work, money. Businesses need less and less labor, because productivity keeps increasing. Our distorted virtue of work is incompatible with reality. We cant maintain full employment with increasing productivity on a planet with finite resources. We just need to find ways to more equitably distribute the income from production. Right now we accept the Ferengi way of life and all want to climb up the economic pyramid on the backs of our neighbors. In other words we all want to have many times more goods and services flow to us for the goods and services we work to create. No, owning a company full of people providing goods and services DOES NOT mean that one has provided others with those goods and services. Those that one feeds on for ones income by owning that business are the ones that provided those goods and services. We can delude ourselves about this when it comes to innovative new business models, but when it comes to simple, established items like food, its obvious that theyre just full of themselves. So often the owners just hire others to do the mental work required to manage their property anyway. I dont have the answers, but I know that most of us will effectively become slaves if we do not reverse the trend of consolidation of wealth. Time is money. When we accept such income disparity what we are actually accepting is a time disparity. We accept that some work a very long time for a little while others work very little time for a lot. How can we not see this as servitude? Are we that blinded by the shine of the mansions and yachts we covet? We are consenting to our own enslavement by accepting this race to the top of the pyramid of exploitation. We dont live to work, we work to live. Lets not forget that."

26972700606,The Waltons are exactly whats wrong with this country. Evil incarnate. Never - EVER - shop at Walmart. Theres no excuse.
26972702805,"This article is hugely misleading. First of all their wealth as a family is derived from stock and asset control not direct profit from the stores; Its all relative to how well their company is performing in trades on the NYSE not to the irrelevant number of sales revenue that the article points out. And yes I know the revenue number drives stock prices, but the prices in actuality are driven more by things such as employee count, profit margin, and market control. Which brings me to my second point, despite having 469 billion in sales they only turn around a 3 percent profit margin which means when all is said and done and the bills are paid including salaries the end result net income of that 469 billion is 17 billion dollars. Which in a lot of cases would not leave a lot extra left over for increases in salaries for those 2.2 million employees that everyone is always barking about saving from the evils of Walmart or 1.3 million if you only care about America. I dont agree with their business practices which is why I dont shop there. Their low prices are derived from deviously low wages that are supplemented by government assistance to their workers who are not earning a living wage. The only reason why they can have such low prices is because they are getting a tax break through an off book channel through their employees as opposed to actual corporate government assistance. Everyone who complains has a right to not shop in such companies, and they also have the right to not participate in their stock. But frankly complaining about someone who uses the system in the way that its set up to be used, that is not Walmarts fault. And they have no obligation by law to pay more than the minimum wage. Politicians can gas up a room with these arguments as much as they want to get votes but the reality is they are all pocketing money from these companies to keep their respective seats in office on both sides of the aisle.

26972719031,"If subsequently anyone proceeds thinks that the Walton family has therefore brought an equal value to our economy as the bottom 42 percent of Americans, they need to have their head examined. The values assigned different paths through our society is only very loosely correlated with the true value. Nowhere is this more apparent than when looking at the top 1%. "
26972721303,"Yeah and these are the same type of people that move production to China etc because local labour costs are too high. Pssshhht, the problem is that they are greedy beyond any measure."
26972724097,They control all the stocks of this publicly traded company? Also: love the wealth distribution posts. I assume everyone posting them is making sure all the other poor people in the neighbourhood and city they live in is getting money from them too? I assume youre taking a homeless person to a movie and/or letting them play your PS4 on your big screen? 
26972724377,"People seriously need to realize that this isnt new. Take a look at Carnegie, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, etc. This income inequality issue is real, but only in the sense that the government has sold out the solid blue collar jobs that allowed people to support families with. The watering down of the unions and the exporting of jobs is what has really hurt. Not the Waltons, or families like them. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_historical_figures"

26972726788,I wonder what percentage of Americans are in debt and have zero financial worth?
26972729240,Thats because the bottom 42% are worthless and utterly expendable. 
26972731009,Capitalism at its finest

26972733759,After reading these comments im confused. Whats wrong with walmart?
26972734244,"Makes me proud to be an Arkansas, woo pig sooie"
26972736006,these articles are getting really fucking old. no one gives a shit
26972738804,"Whats really sickening here is that you cant say just dont shop there. Some people have become so impoverished by this system, that they cant shop anywhere else, thus feeding the system itself. "
26972739356,Yeah fuck capitalism
26972741458,"After watching a Walmart documentary my friend runs around campus screaming, Walmart is evil!"
26972741509,.000000018% of the population has money equal to what the bottom 42% have. Great direction our country is headed.
26972742639,Good thing they pay taxes on it and otherwise invest the bulk of their funds into driving the economy...
26972743211,"The Waltons make almost none of their income off of the performance of the stores. Not directly anyway. They own a non-majority stake of the company through shares they inherited. They get income from the dividends these shares earn. As it is, the shares that make up their net respective net worths are just money that exists on paper. They dont actually have that kind of cash laying around in bank accounts, etc. Now, if they converted the stocks to cash by selling them, thatd be a bit different. But castigating these people because of some net worth figure that exits only on paper is kind of silly."
26972744801,"Walmart used to actually take really good care of their employees. That is, until Sams bunch of half-wit kids took over. Theyre a greedy bunch of little shits. Still, I shop at walmart, and even if you did have the mom and pop shops still around, you would too. Walmart didnt take over for no reason. They have an incredibly simple, yet effective business model: everything in one place for cheaper than anyone else. Its easy to be idealistic when you have nothing at stake, but when youre stretching every dollar you can to make ends meet, the difference between paying $800 a month for groceries at walmart vs $1100 at the local grocer is a no-brainer. Also, shopping at Target doesnt make you a better person, youre just feeding a different beast. Quit trying to claim moral superiority. "
26972745622,Went to school with one of the Waltons grandchildren. Was a humble kid.
26972746193,Yep the Waltons are rich. WTF does this have to do with politics?
26972746200,They sold America to the Chinese for a few billion. They should be burned in dumpsters.
26972747728,"when you have that much wealth, why not pay the workers more? Seriously, why not? its not like they need the money. It can be alternative to giving to charity"
26972751681,enough to make me physically ill to my stomach.
26972751834,Grrr! Damn successful people! How about we take their money so I can get me some obamaphones and medical marijuana?
26972752292,"I dont get these kinds of critical titles. I mean, obviously, they went out of their comfort zone, risked everything and made their business big. What the fuck is wrong with that? Of course they are gonna be rich. Of course a person who takes the safe route (college, someones employee) will not have the same fortune as someone who does NOT take the safe route, risks everything and succeeds. Now, how they treat their employees is another issue."
26972753952,Oh god. That is actually worse than even I thought. I guess they are getting richer and the bottom is getting poorer so they difference is getting greater at an alarming rate. The power shift with be enormous.
26972755596,Better redistribute their wealth. 
26972756938,Perhaps we should forcibly redistribute their wealth with a bullet or 10?
26972757360,Sounds like the bottom 42% need to pick it up a bit.
26972761632,"Nobody mentions the fact that the Walton family donated $300 million to The University of Arkansas, the state that holds WalMart HQ, and continues to donate. http://admissions.uark.edu/1456.php"
26972764538,And? I hate when being successful is made out to be a bad
26972767178,So they are massively in debt?

26972771054,"Sam Walton had to borrow $30,000 to open his first store. "

26972772816,"Should be illegal. I dont understand why these people would keep this much money to themselves, and not change the world for the better. So greedy its scary. "
26972772935,"Ey, its a meritocracy, why dont you believe it? Believe it!"
26972776065,Who knew Bill Walton was this rich?
26972776517,Why are we punishing success by insinuating that maybe its wrong for a handful of people to have the same amount of money as 131 million people combined?
26972778409,IM. SO. ANGRY. GIVE ME MONEY. RRRRAAAAAAAA
26972779108,We know already. Bother you? Stop fucking shopping at walmart. Not really much more you can do other than bitch about it.
26972781639,"My god, what a biased title. U jelly?"

26972788869,So?
26972789546,"So what do we do about it? Outside of taking every last penny and distributing it equally to the bottom 42 percent, what can be done?"
26972790999,Wealth.... Not income. Bill Gates by himself has a net worth of more than half the Waltons combined net worth. In all honesty I am surprised the Waltons net worth is not more.

26972795736,This statistic is almost unbelievable. Maybe these guys will be future Marie Antoinettes when the seemingly unavoidable revolution occurs (as has happened throughout history in instances of extreme consolidation of wealth).

26972814771,we need robin hood
26972815373,"As well they should. Someone in their immediate ancestry made such wealth possible for them, so they are honor-bound to create jobs for the rest of us. ^^^^/s If there is any hope left, it lies with the proles."
26972815978,"So? Have the Waltons broken any laws? Other than jealousy and envy, why should they be forced to give any more than the taxes that they already pay to anyone else? Have you any idea how much Wal-Mart pays annually in taxes? Over $7 billion. Perhaps we *should* penalize the corporation, kill some jobs, and ultimately kill this golden goose - then we can watch as many wasteful social program begin to wither and rot on the governmental vine because they lack funding. Heres the $7 billion source: http://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Wal-Mart-Stores-Inc/Financial-Statement/Statement-of-Cash-Flows"
26972817832,I thought it would have been 47 percent...
26972826080,The wealth distribution is completely fine!
26972827807,If this is a problem for people maybe its time to seek out alternatives to walmart as a consumer with the aim to weaken their position and increase competition. 
26972831222,"The fact is the family DOES have a controlling share in the corporation but none of them have anything what-so-ever to do with how the company has been ran since Sam died. Yes they still get their cut but to blame the managerial practices on his grandkids isnt completely fair. As someone who was raised in Waltonville this is where I have a serious conflict. Its true that the current incarnation of Walmart is a textbook version of the purist form of megacorporation that could exist, raping the land and the peoples all in an effort to increase its base margin BUT the original incarnation built this tiny town into what it is today: a proud city with art, food and music that cant be found within a 500 mile radius...all of which is due to the charity work of the daughters and grandchildren of Sam Walton. It might not seem like much to the rest of the nation and I am in no way condoning the actions of the corporate douchebags who are raping our work force but Ive got to say that, here, in their hometown, the Waltons have always done right by their neighbors."
26972831337,Obviously we should execute the Walton family and redistribute the wealth to the bottom 42 percent.
26972831557,I dont understand how a family can be so greedy. I mean you have the opportunity to make the lives of a significant amount of people better without harming your own quality of living significantly and they choose not too.
26972833506,"I think when you get that filthy rich, all bets are off. You should have to pay for everything. Fire at your house? better have hired a private firefighting company. Break in? Private security. Make no law apply to them at all so if they show their greedy faces in public theyd better have a small army with them because murder will not stick. Its already that way for them, as no rich fuck ever gets convicted of shit, at least this way we can take a few out for sport on weekends."
26972836020,why are all the scores hidden?
26972837585,Does this measurement of wealth include debt as a negative of worth? Ive always wondered if Im considered a negative value (in terms of wealth) because of these shitty student loans.
26972840989,The Waltons also give nothing to charity. Theyre everything wrong with this greed fuelled economy.
26972843074,"I really think somebody should make an updated Poor Richards Almanac people are content with their wuality of life because they dont know anything else - and thats fine. But if somebody were to point out the opportunities available to them along with how to utilise em, itd be a win-win with everybody. Everybody has a skill; and everybody is willing to pay somebody to use it. I really do hope that somebody finds a way to help these people out... Obviously, only if they want to be helped. Not because i say that they have a shitty way of life, just because i dont like people believing they cant get better when they can - they just gotta look for it."
26972844768,Its easy. Just hire the bottom 42 percent of americans and cut their pay in half.
26972846726,"Thats really fucking cool. Wow, pretty inspiring. Oh wait.. Was this supposed to be a negative thing? Oh yeah I forgot, they have more than me so Im supposed to be jealous and hate them and call for new laws that take their money away from them and give it to me."
26972847300,"Does them being super rich somehow make me poorer? I dont get why its such a huge deal that the top 1% has so much money. If I have a steady job, am able to live in a decent house, drive a good car, and take care of my child, why should I care that they have so much? Sure there is poverty in this country but what are they supposed to do? Give their money away? A lot of them donate billions to charity."
26972852146,"Capitalism, thats what im talking about!"
26972855128,Isnt it weird how riots dont happen at walmarts all across the nation?
26972855617,Wal-mart is also the worst paying job in America 
26972859499,How the fuck is Walmart not a monopoly?
26972859873,As capitalists though dont the Waltons have a fairly socialist agenda... Not so conservative so to speak. Happy to be schooled on this.
26972865554,"Again with this communist bill maher rhetoric. Business leaders put out way more money than they actually make by creating jobs. The wealth a CEO has is only a tiny fraction of the wealth they created and id be willing to bet they give a sizable amount of that fraction to charities too (whether they do that as a tax write off or because they genuinely want to help is irrelevant. Its still a good thing), yet somehow they are greedy and selfish. "
26972868946,"And it all started with a guy who never took a dime from the Govt and drove a ratty old pick up truck. Andrew Carnegie was once a penniless immigrant. And look what he built. Bill Gates was writing Basic code before he made his Billions. Have you ever heard the story about that guy who developed Facebook? Income inequality is just another contrived demon form the left. If someone is content eating the scraps that fell off a rich mans table, good for you. But if you want to make it, youre going to have to work for it. Thats life. Fair is a place where cows go to compete for ribbons."
26972871191,"They worked for it and built themselves an empire. This is america, this is fundamentally the American way. People who cry about this are probably the same people who think everyone should get a trophy in kids sports. "
26972872466,"Jokes on them. Lots of those folks have a negative net worth. Suck it, Waltons."
26972874781,"I feel the need to, once again, point out what bullshit statistics these are. I really wish people would educate themselves as to how wealth is calculated and how to accrue it. If I told you I was wealthier than the bottom 25% of Americans combined, you might not think I was a Walton, but youd surely assume I was well off. Nah. Im middle class at best. Due to the way wealth is calculated, [being wealthier than the bottom 25% of Americans is as easy as having no debt and $5 to your name.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2011/12/14/six-waltons-have-more-wealth-than-the-bottom-30-of-americans/) But remember, negative net worth does NOT mean someone is *poor*. Many people with negative net worth are highly paid professionals who have large houses (and large mortgages to go with those houses) as well as hefty student loan debt. The people being counted among the bottom 25% of Americans with negative net worth *could very well have six or seven figure salaries*. This is why its ridiculous to see this dead horse beaten at least once a week. Im not saying the Waltons arent ludicrously wealthy. Nor am I saying theyre good people worth defending. Im saying if you want to attack them, *attack them where theyve actually done something wrong*. In the meantime, everyone could do with a healthy self-education regarding wealth accrual. Forbes hosts and supports [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/), a website that is pretty much the Wikipedia for personal finance. I guarantee almost everyone can learn something from this site. It almost certainly wont make you Walton-rich, but if you follow its lessons youll certainly be on the way to a better future and retirement."
26972878468,"Im amazed at the number of people out there that dont see the problem in this. They have no issue with some CEO pulling in $10, 20 or even 100+ million dollars. These people actually defend the obscene salaries and cant put two-and-two together to understand that a wealth distribution as lopsided as this pulls money out from the poor and middle class and concentrates it at the top. Its a direct reason *why* Walmart workers are paid so poorly because most of the money goes to only a few keys people. Its *because* of these practices that full time workers for these companies cant make ends meet, and as such need to go on public assistance, making them a burden on regular tax payers."
26972889284,Good for them!
26972891720,Night John-Boy
26972891902,"I dont get people. Maybe im an idiot, but i just feel people are entitled to the money theyve earned."
26972892596,They must have worked really really hard. /s
26972892903,Damn them. So what can we do to them? Jack taxes up? Theyll just move their money. Confiscate their assets and redistribute the money? Seriously I see all these posts bemoaning the money the wealthy have yet no solutions. The wealthy are always going to have a bigger percentage.

26972900003,"If this fact bothers you then the first thing you can do to help is stop shopping at walmart.

The I wish I could shop somewhere else is just a lazy excuse."
26972901748,uhm yeah? they own freaking Wal-Mart. 
26972904741,"You have to understand that a large chunk of the bottom 42% dont own ANY wealth. Hell, I own more actual wealth than a percent or two of Americans. "
26972904901,Good for them. 
26972906607,"Capitalism is awesome! Nothing at all wrong with this. They earned it! Theyre successful! Say this is sickening or something should be done to solve this problem, or even think its a problem at all, youre evil un-American commie scum. -lots of idiots on the internet and the telly"

26972917134,"And the bottom 35% or something are either in debt or balanced out by those in debt, so a more accurate count would be earning capacity.. this headline keeps popping up without anyone taking note of that."
26972920848,And this shows capitalisms failure.
26972921720,Coincidentally (or not) they also control the wealth of the bottom 42%.
26972922902,"We must raise the highest marginal tax rates back to ,at least, 70%. Probably higher. Does anyone think these people actually work? I mean, besides having their accountant deposit their dividend check from the slave labor and dead Bangaladesh textile workers."
26972922968,"faulty example taken for political purposes, their, held assets may be greater, obviously, as the bottom 42% holds little to no assets in savings, many are in debt, etc. Their revenue and total spending or all the money the take and spend grossed isnt. So what you would imagine from the example and following political argument does not follow from an honest interpretation of the information, normal for liberals."
26972923850,"Okay, thats just their wealth. What are they doing with it? Example: I trust Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to do bigger and more effective things (per dollar) in the philanthropic or tech advancement arenas than ANY other government or average person. They run their charities like they ran their businesses - thats something that the average person (no matter their nationality) is incapable of."

26972929244,They created more value than the bottom forty something percent combined too. Amazing how that works
26972929850,Yet they let their employees suffer.
26972930300,"I wonder if theyre all total dicks. At least one of them should aspire to be like Elon Musk and bring us awesome things like electric cars, online payment systems, and space-flight in the private sector."
26972938407,Im not surprised. Theyre the most successful business in the country.
26972938800,So what they cant be rich? is what my uncle said when I brought this up at Thanksgiving dinner. 
26972942829,But they worked so hard for that money. They deserve it!

26972981048,And? Im supposed to be offended because someone made a shit ton of money?
26972989731,Wealth does not equal cash. A lot of what they have is stock and the value of Wal Marts assets. Not exactly liquid assets. 
26972992751,I am the 42%

26973035377,Okay... So... Pillage all of their money?
26973038152,Their wealth includes the company value though. This fact is equivalent to saying Walmart is a big company! It certainly wouldnt help the poor to liquidate the company and distribute it to them.
26973045068,"So, if we seized their entire fortune and distributed it evenly between all americans, we would each get about $435."
26973057268,"well, yeah. he started one of the largest companies in american history. also, that value isnt just sitting in a bank either, it likely consists of lots of walmart stock. (remember how some times bill gates is the richest man in the world and sometimes hes not? that is the same logic. his value fluctuates with the value of ms stock)."
26973063296,Boycott walmart this christmas and next year. That would be enough to get rid of them.
26973094523,"So? Its also the largest retailer in the world. I mean, Im not defending their practices... but the numbers are pretty meaningless. Its not like.. the waltons could give up all their stuff and now the bottom 42 percent of Americans would be rich.. theyd just have twice as much money. "

In care you are wondering, the reason that pre-exesting conditions are no longer allowed as exclusionary is so that these kinds of people can be covered...their premiums and the tax subsidies that go along with them are gravy for the insurance companies.

YOU will probably never need (or at least dont think you will need -- good luck being part of the vanishing middle class) subsidized care. Those people have had their standard of living reduced and if they get sick and cant meet their deductible insurance wont pay jack.

Well, thats easy! Just fire them! you might say. Unfortunately, this companys contracts are written in a way that makes this so difficult that in over two hundred years, only ONE employee has ever been fired from this company. Now, all is not lost! These web designers can only work for a set number of contracts in their lifetime, after which, they can no longer apply. Surely, theyd get some web design done during that last contract, right? Since they know they dont need to torch juggle ever again? Weeell, they actually just spend all of their last contract helping their friends and family learn to torch juggle, so THEY can get cushy web design jobs. **tl;dr: If you set up a system where people compete for a job thats entirely unrelated to the competition itself, youre going to end up with people that are good at the competition, not the job.** "

26823976253,We need to elect someone that really understands the constitution. Someone that maybe taught constitutional law at some point.

The Constitution of the United States of America (ratified 1788), prior to the addition of the Bill of Rights (ratified 1791), is all about economics; the current Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation (ratified 1781) because under the AoC the federal government could not tax nor could it regulate commerce (interstate and international). Thus, the current Constitution was drafted to breakdown how the locus of power between States and all forms of government would function based on economic variables. As an example, the 3/5s compromise."

26824321448,"I would like to correct the misunderstandings, mischaracterizations, and outright misinformation about *Citizens United*: (1). *Citizens United* did not declare corporations are people and thus have First Amendment rights. Even Lawrence Lessig rebuffs this bit of misinformation. What the Supreme Court held was that the First Amendment protects *speech* not *speakers* and that any regulation of speech (no matter the source) must meet strict scrutiny. Note: the term corporate personhood shows up once in the entire case: in Stevens dissent. (2). *Citizens United* does *not* allow for unlimited donations by corporations to candidates nor for corporations to give large sums of money. FEC limits on direct donations to campaigns are in the low four figures, period. *Citizens United* was about whether restricts on independent political advocacy met strict scrutiny, they did not. If someone would like to point to the part of Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech which allows for discrimination based on source, I am happy to hear it. (3). No, corporations cannot get around this by using Super PACs. A Super PAC is super because it can receive (and spend) an unlimited amount of money. What makes them super? They cannot donate to a candidate. One thin nickel and theyre back to being the same as any other PAC: the most anyone can donate is $5,000. (4). No, you dont have evidence corporations donate vast sums anyway. Dont link to that news article. All of those articles are going off of the Open Secrets website. But what Open Secrets admits (that the news article doesnt) is that [we standardize the name of the donors employer. If enough contributions came in from people connected with that same employer, the organizations name winds up on the Top Contributor list.](http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/include/contribmethod_pop.php) See also: [The organizations themselves did not donate , rather the money came from the organizations PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals immediate families.](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638). Its how Elizabeth Warren receives [$304,050 from Harvard University](http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;cid=N00033492&amp;newMem=Y&amp;type=I). The university didnt cut her a check. Those are donations from individual employees of Harvard. (5). There is no difference between what a PAC does and what Google did by going dark to protest SOPA. In both cases it is an attempt to *influence* voters by presenting an argument. You can argue that it distorts the political views of the American people, but Ive yet to see someone justify allowing Google, Wikipedia, Reddit, and the New York Times to do it, but not allowing Moveon.org to do it. (6). Correlation does not prove causation. Even if we accept that there is a distorting influence of this money, it does not indicate corruption. The explanation that a wealthy individual is donating to a PAC to help someone get elected so he can exert influence is no more likely (I would argue less likely) than the explanation that a wealthy individual donates to get someone *who already agrees with him* elected. (7). The entire argument against *Citizens United* (when it is properly understood) relies on a belief that the American people cannot be trusted with democracy. It relies on a belief that the American people are slavishly obedient to whatever advertisements tell them, and will do no amount of research, or much by way of thoughtful analysis, when told something. Justice Stevens argued as much in his dissent: If individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to and contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no special ability to influence elections apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they make any)... then I suppose the majority¡¯s premise would be sound.

26824041514,"What I found very useful is to apply some principles of the Evolution Theory to politics: Not the smartest and best win. Those who survive the longest win. And you dont survive because you have great ideas or concepts, but because you recieve funds that help you to keep advertising and hire a staff that keeps you relevant. And the most reliable way to recieve funds is, to be a bumlicker for the rich. And not just that, its also quite obviously so that the rich are much more influential in this society. They appear successful and influential, they can buy attention and have well-connected people around them in their sociotope. Ultimately that leads to a clear correlation between money and percieved credibility and reliability, as we do not expect people in expensive clothes and with good contacts to act like thugs. And of course it works in a similar way in the media... those who have ideas that diverge from the perception of the rich are considered irresponsible and ideological. This leads to scenarios where for example during the Nicaragua crisis Nicaragua was seen as the most problematic country in central America, even though it was the *only* country there at the time that did *not* massacre its own people, and even had successful social reform. But the government was socialist and the rich did not accept that, as that could have blocked their ways to rob and influence the country. If the measurement of problematic instead would have been things like social inequality and state murder, it would have been the *least* problematic country. Yet as Noam Chomsky found out, the mainstream press did, in of 80 researched opinions for example in the New York Times, not once question the fundamental necessity of an intrusion into Nicaraguan affairs, but rather limited all discussion on the tactical idea of how to do these intrusions. In other words, the press is highly ideological since a long time already, but we dont recognize it but rather agree with their ideas of what unacceptable opinions are. And then we wonder every few years how they could for example condemn Snowden so easily."

He has served as a role model for our junior senator, Jeff Merkley, and both now host town hall meetings in each and every county in the state, every year. Who would you suggest replacing these legislators with? The simple fact of the matter is, the problem is not *all* politicians, but merely a majority of them.

Its the combination of visual images, music, and scripting that give these ads the power to elect. Its where most of the money goes, and for a good reason. Its effective. Most people arent going to take the time to read an ad thats deceptive or many ads in a repetitive nature. Print media just doesnt have the same influence. Trying to argue a corporation isnt an individual is futile now, but passing legislation that deceptive ads or ads in general are not conducive to civic responsibilities is probably easier at this point. Let em spend all the money they want, but the thing that has the best results for the money spent wont be available anymore. "

26824562894,"She is wrong though. They dont **have** to spend all their time raising money and campaigning for office. They **choose** to do that -- because they WANT to stay in office (and pursue politics as a career). The problem isnt really just money, it is that politics has become a life-long CAREER, rather than a form of (temporary) public service. Not to mention that the majority of the money that politicians raise... ends up being pay TO THE MEDIA (which profiteers from it, and which ironically enough is a big part of what pays Ms Stahl her ridiculously oversized salary as a political reporter). So when it comes right down to it, the media -- including Ms Leslie Stahl herself -- are at least as much to blame for the problems with the system as anyone else."

There are several statistics that you can search for on the web that show this. Campaign finance is the only realistic way to unseat an incumbent. Campaign finance reform that is restrictive in certain ways would tie the hands of those who would oppose an incumbent. We do need reform but just as they would never give themselves a pay cut and they would never give themselves a term limit, they are not going to make campaign finance reform that makes it easy for them to be unseated, you are basically asking them to self regulate, so be careful what you wish for you might not like the results.

26830682811,"Partially true, however that was much too simplified for me to agree with its substance. I will say that moneyed interests hold too much sway in our political system. One of the major issues that people/ commentators fail to identify is with the lack of party cohesion. Which essentially hold no power in the political process, therefore our politicians are beholden to their electorate, and moneyed interests. Or more simply, if there are 100 republicans across the country, they are bound by their voters to push for their idea of policy...however politicians in different regions have different agendas. What once gave parties enforcement powers over their members was removed in the 1970s . So even though there are two parties, they exist in a nominal way only, and politicians have become what are called individual enterprises... No party cohesion = no policy cohesion, which ultimately leads to no policies getting made and most importantly NO ACCOUNTABILITY to voters on a national level."
26865214396,"Third parties cannot win because information is controlled by money and the money flows through the two parties. If we could somehow fund a third party at a level comparable to the Dems and Repubs, they could win, but would have the same weaknesses that the Dems and Repubs have now (unresponsiveness to the needs of average citizens/over responsiveness to compaign contributors). Furthermore, (I am less sure about this argument) the third party argument is a bit naive. Government is an incredibly complex machine and only the parties really know how it works. A third party President would lack vital insider connections needed to get things done. The best option is to force the parties to change. Americans need to demand better. Increased intra-party turnover as punishment for campaign-trail lies will force the parties to de-homogenize and respond to the public will. History shows how far the parties can change when the public stops believing their bullshit. Only if the parties did not change in response to broad public disapproval could a third party conceivably be successful. And the American public is nowhere close to broadly disapproving."
26864941218,"Really good points, but Im not sure what your proposed solution is. We are absolutely stuck voting for the lesser of two evils, and the Democrats are absolutely that vote. As voters, what we can do is cause high turnover in the Democratic party. Always vote Democrat, but if that Democrat is a wolf in sheeps clothing, vote them out in the next primary. We have seen how horrible revolution is, so we must change things from within the system, and that requires voter awareness. I do not know how to raise voter awareness though."

I will not just vote the lesser of 2 evils any longer, I would like to see a clean sweep of the house in 2014 and will not vote again for my congressman (Duncan Hunter Jr. CA-52). Folks on both sides need to understand the system is completely corrupted and we need to start over.

You could run your dog and that makes your rep spend money running ads and mobilize support for the primaries. In states with open primaries the GOP would rally to support the weaker candidate, which would make it a race even if your primary challenger is grossly under qualified. A couple primary challenges send a clearer message than all the emails you could ever send. "
26865069493,The problem is candidates can say whatever they want when running (they can lie). So we have to give them a chance and then have the awareness to know when they are liars and punish them for it.
26865103569,"I might be right or wrong, but as I see it there are problems with both parties. I refuse to vote for any candidate, regardless of party, whos ideas and values I disagree with. Mitt Romney was so pro-business its sickening. Corporations get enough tax breaks in this country - to the tune of billions of dollars a year and a first-class seat at the head of government. Corporate tax breaks, by and large, need to go away. Secondly, corporate political spending need to be outlawed. Obama is just a liar, plain and simple. Out of all the campaign promises he made, 48% were either stalled, compromised or broken outright. [Link](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/). Not only that, but hes continued and even expanded many of the domestic spying programs enacted under his predecessor, then lied about what they do - to the *public on national TV* [Link](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/08/07/obama_we_dont_have_a_domestic_spying_program.html). Even more egregious, he blames their continued presence on Bush? Hes been in office long enough now to change them. Instead he shift blame? Thats not Hope and Change, Thats Its not my fault. His campaign advisers got it right. The Hope and Change mantra of his campaigns were happily swallowed by the people because *thats what we really want - CHANGE*. Instead we got another politician, content to keep the status quo, raises taxes fruitlessly while stripping the pockets of the middle class to pay for expanded programs no one wants - or worse, dont know exist. The only thing Obama is really good at is giving speeches. There are platforms in both parties that I vehemently disagree with. I disagree with expanded government that forces me to pay more and more and get nothing of value in return. Obamacare is a disaster waiting to happen, regardless of all the things liberals point to that will be fixed under it, such as denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. Frankly, it doesnt go far enough to fix the underlying problems with our Healthcare system. I disagree with giving unfair tax breaks and economic benefits to businesses just because they line the politicians pockets with gold every election. While its undeniable that it save these companies money, the fact is these savings are not doing anything to improve the economy - instead this wealth is being amassed and sheltered in tax havens, giving CEOs and other board member the capability of having Golden Parachutes and other insulators that protect them against failure, while the rest of the workforce suffers."

Bill Clinton was the one who introduced legislation saying that the able-bodied needed to try to find work or to be in a job training program in order to get food stamps. http://www.mediaite.com/online/wsjs-mary-kissel-democrats-voting-against-bill-clintons-reforms-for-food-stamps/ Obama eliminated that requirement. As a result of relaxed rules and a registration campaign, food stamps have more than doubled in the past five years. http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/behind-the-big-increase-in-food-stamps/ Veterans CAN use the GI Bill to enroll themselves in a job training program and get food stamps. They can work part time (and IIRC do some community service) and get food stamps. Mother Jones isnt telling the whole truth."

He should have told both parties to take the pork out of the bill and THEN pass it."
27033381074,"Youll forgive me if I dont recall discussing this with you. Maybe you could point me to that thread. The issue with the relief bill was the principle. THAT is what conservatives objected to. It doesnt matter what sort of pork was in it, conservatives objected (and Im talking about every day conservatives) to spending that was NOT something brought about by Sandy. There was money for Alaskan fisheries put in that bill. There was substantial spending that had nothing to do with Sandy. Thats what conservatives objected to. It was a behemoth spending bill. "

I have to wait 9 minutes between posts even when liberals here are rapid firing questions at me. The comment you responded to isnt even controversial. Its documented fact.

I heard that in a closed-door meeting...really, I did. Im writing a book about it. Do you understand me? Obama dictated some policy he wanted that the GOP was necessarily going to oppose, because their voters oppose it. And the Senate is sitting on over 200 bills passed by the House...why? To say one side is just unreasonably obstructionist...and the other side doesnt obstruct is wrong. And the top comment here is not sourced by ANYTHING legitimate. Obama IS a partisan. He was the most liberal Senator in the Senate before he was elected. http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/31/study-obama-most-liberal-senator-last-year/ The democrats SHUT DOWN THE government SEVEN times under Reagan.

Senator Voinovich on record, tells the author, If he was for it, we had to be against it, Voinovich tells Grunwald. And at another point, characterizing a strategy session Republicans and McConnell had held in early January of 2009, Voinovich said: He wanted everyone to hold the fort. All he cared about was making sure Obama could never have a clean victory. A Republican aide sheds some more light on McConnells strategizing just after the 2008 election. Page 148: People were pretty demoralized, and there were two totally opposite thoughts on how to approach the situation, a McConnell aide recalls. One was, we dont like the president, we ought to pop him early. The other was, hes really popular, we should work with him, because thats what people want us to do. The bosss take was: Neither.

Of course, it does seem to corroborate pretty well with all their actions since Obama was elected. Both times. [Heres an interesting video from old Mitchy-boy](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/10/1118614/-Biden-Mitch-McConnell-vowed-no-cooperation-with-the-Obama-administration-from-the-get-go#) Our top political priority over the next two years should be to deny President Obama a second term. Republican obstructionism under Obama is unprecedented. It just is. Unless you havent been paying attention to politics the last 5 years, or only been listening to right wing media, it is obvious. Just like climate change, you cant deny reality or twist the facts. There is chart after chart after chart showing the numbers in almost every way you can measure it to demonstrate how far Republicans have gone to obstruct Obama. Some key words that you may have heard over the past couple years: Supermajority, cloture, filibuster, nominees, shutdown, compromise, repeal Obamacare, debt ceiling, etc... http://crooksandliars.com/jon-perr/republicans-unprecedented-obstructionism-by-numbers http://www.nationalmemo.com/5-ways-the-gops-obstruction-is-unprecedented/ http://www.epi.org/blog/congressional-republicans-smothered-rapid-economic-recovery/ http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/05/03/happy-hour-roundup-new-report-confirms-gop-obstructionism-is-unprecedented/ The false equivalency wont work either. You can compare the numbers, ask a historian, or heck, even read yourself about politics when the places are reversed. Yes, when Bush was in office and Democrats controlled the Senate, the indexes spiked, but not even close to the extent that Republicans have on everything from filibusters to blocking judicial nominees. Resistance and obstructionist are two different things.

Some for innocuous reasons, like the scheduling of the Presidents White House Barbeque. Not to the extent and over such hard-lined ideological issues we have had since Gingrichs shutdowns. In fact, ironically, since the impact was so little on everyone politically and practically, including the public, shutdowns were more common. It wasnt really until Republicans under Clinton really raised the stakes of what a shutdown could be. 26 days, over overtly ideological issues. Seems kind of different, if you ask me. Look at just ONE of your talking points, Dems shut down govt 7 times under Reagan! One simple sentence, the implication being, Oh, so it is normal. Or, Dems are just being hypocrites. Or, Dems do it also, so its fine if Republicans do it. It takes *so* much explaining just to get people to understand and undo all the coded language in that one brilliantly crafted talking point.

Particularly the America is unusually violent which excludes nations that outpace us that would normally be listed under OECD, not to mention make it look like there is more of a gap than there actually is between 2 deaths per 100,000 and 5 deaths per 100,000. Granted a 150% increase is significant but its scaled in a way that exaggerates it. Same with the Gas Guzzlers, notice that the Axis starts at 10% making America appear 400% over other nations instead of the admittedly not so great 80%ish."

26761046656,"USA is great in principle, and on TV. "
26760773185,"A large amount of the data is skewed to cast the US in an unfavorable light. The use of graphs has always and will always do this. Graphs such as this are always misleading at first glance due to the fact that the information used to create them are not clearly stated with the graph; and the references, in the case of these statistics, are somewhat shady. These also look at national laws, and do not take into account any state laws that the US has or social norms in the US; which has a huge affect on most of the data in the graphs. Take for example the violence statistics. It takes into account the nations in the OECD that the US is above. Leaving out Estonia and Mexico, which are greatly ahead of the US in violence. Turkey is also not included, due to the fact that the information could not reliably be obtained. Other problems in this set of data is the way in which the national statistics are reported; that being in a reliable way. When looking at the surveillance data it shows that most of the faults it lists are the lack of laws preventing government intrusion, REAL-ID, and border surveillance. The greatest factor seaming the be the fact that the US Constitution has no law granting a right to privacy other than the Fourth Amendment. Also making this graph somewhat misleading. While there is no national paid maternity leave there is the Family and Medical Leave act, which provides up to 12 weeks unpaid leave; with paid leave being up the the discretion of the employer. California and New Jersey have state legislation that provides paid Family Leave insurance. However this is provided through payroll tax to the employees; imposing no cost to employers. In regards to vacation time, it only accounts for national laws providing vacation and does not take into account any state laws. Also a recent study done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2011 found that over 90% of all full-time private sector jobs, and 40% of all part-time private sector jobs, provided paid vacation time. This also takes into account that these are based on full-time jobs. The gas guzzler graph also doesnt take into account the amount of public transportation, amount of population in rural areas, or the number of cars per capita; only global emissions per capita. The women in government statistic shows no reference other than World Data Bank and as such holds no validity in my opinion. Does it take into account local and state government or is it only federal government? Im not going to go searching for some random information that i may not find to verify this. **TL;DR**: these graphs are incredibly biased and pretty much shit."

26760737162,The reason the US is so low is that Americans on average prefer non-interventionalist policies. Many dont like the idea of employer regulation from the government on things like vacation days and maternity leave.

That depends on a persons political beliefs and your definition of what freedom is.

US On-highway regulations are not very focused on CO2 emissions, and are more focused on NOx, CO, and particulate matter. In fact, as far as I know (and I could be wrong as I work exclusively with diesels) the US Government doesnt even regulate CO2 emissions in cars! I will attest that CO2 emissions are directly related to consumption of fuel, but the two issues I have with this graph are that: 1) It doesnt specify what is included, who is included, anything other than listing these numbers. This may or may not include Semis, other work trucks, military, all of which could have a huge effect on the numbers. 2) The main reason for this differential, at least in my opinion, is the fact that due to higher taxes and gas prices in other countries, the US often doesnt get vehicles which get much higher mpg! We hardly get any diesel models, not very many smaller more fuel efficient cars, and while it could very well be that the market here wont support those models, I still feel like it needs to be mentioned as a cause for this difference in CO2 emissions /rant"

26760944422,"Theres one major caveat that isnt disclosed in the last graph about womens participation in government: Many of the countries, such as Rwanda and Argentina, *mandate* minimal levels of female representation or list placement through political gender quotas (essentially taking away voters absolute discretion to choose in exchange for greater diversity, which raises other ethical quandaries). This would arguably be unconstitutional in the US, and even if it werent, the USs winner-takes-all system of voting would make such a mandate impossible to implement. So theres little, from an institutional standpoint, that the US can do to affirmatively increase representation. You would have to change voters prejudices toward female public officials in order to get effective change, or have an already male-dominated Congress amend the Constitution.

For example, lets get rid of the restriction against buying health insurance across state lines. This simply makes no sense. Why should healthcare be confined to the state you live in? If theres a more affordable plan in another state, why should you be prevented from purchasing it? What happens when you move? Do you lose your health insurance? Do you have to buy another insurance plan? This make no sense! Just allow people to buy whatever insurance they want wherever it is. This will increase competition among companies and help drive down costs. And thats just one way of fixing our healthcare system without spending a dime: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhJ73JuWJY (And before anyone says that we need to go national because other countries have socialized national healthcare systems, both Switzerland and Singapore provide universal healthcare WITHOUT a socialized national healthcare system: http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/the-myth-of-the-free-market-american-health-care-system/254210/ So why not emulate them?) As for women in government, while it would be ideal to have more diversity in our government, pragmatically, it should not be our main concern. We ought to be focusing on what our politicians stand for, not what dangles between their legs. It would be nice to have a female president, but think about the recent women whove tried to run for president. Would we really want someone like Sarah Palin or Michelle Bachmann or Hilary Clinton running the country? Seeing as how most of these women would run the country into the ground, Im guessing most of you wouldnt. More female politicians would be nice, but competent female politicians would be nicer. Think quality, not quantity."

26760761699,"Only a few of these graphs really indicate bad things. For example, the fact we dont require maternity leave or vacation time are GOOD THINGS!! We let businesses and individuals decide for themselves. Personally, I do not want to live in a country with required vacation time, I want the freedom to decide for myself whether I want more money (i.e. work more) or want a vacation. Some family friends in Germany are disappointed with their system, because they make the maximum amount as doctors and are required to take time off work. They take off about a week every month (but shouldnt they have the freedom to choose if they want to work and earn more?!)"
26760761843,You mean 6 graphs. Women in government does not say anything about being overrated or not. Government is a tiny percentage of people.

26760767368,"Two of these graphs strike me as being entirely out of place in a human rights discussion: maternity leave and paid vacation. Who in their right mind can honestly argue that we, by nature of being human, have the right to paid time off? Its something we would enjoy, certainly. But how can you force a company to spend the enormous amount of money required for something like a month of paid vacation and call it freedom? The company I work for employs (I think) 66 people, with I would estimate an average pay rate of ~$20/hr. If they are required to give 4 weeks vacation, that amounts to just over $211,000 of pure cost (per year), mandated by the government. Yearly sales are probably around $8 million, and lets say 15% of that is profit. Thats $1.2M. So the government is forcing them to spend 17.5% of their net earnings. That said, my employer offers paid vacation that you earn through loyalty - a format I find totally agreeable - Starting with 2 weeks after your first year, another week after 3, and a 4th after 10 years or something. This is a BENEFIT, not a right. Thats a problem with our entitlement culture. People just want everything for free. Paid maternity leave is something I could get on board with easier, but still, I believe something like that would be a benefit an employer offers, not an inalienable right. Having kids is expensive, you should know that before you go making babies. Its a tremendous responsibility that you ought to plan for, not fall into. But thats a topic for another thread. And holy hell Canada! 50 weeks?? Another that stands out to me is the gas guzzlers plot of CO2 per capita. There are so many factors affecting fuel consumption (and efficiency thereof) that I have trouble taking this graph with anything but a grain of salt. Yes I know the US is behind most countries in the regulation of environmental factors like these, but I would like the see how much of these emissions are related to availability and feasibility of mass transit systems in compact vs large countries. Similarly how much the domestic shipping industry is involved (e.g. heavy reliance on trucking for cross country delivery). The violence data is a bit frightening, to say the least. I wonder (wasnt able to read the article/data if its available) how the surveillance states were ranked. What was the criteria? Where did the data come from? Who is the [company?] publishing this research, and what are their ties? TL:DR Im a skeptic, and some of this stuff I dont think really belongs."

We are aware that we have a very expensive health care system. We are aware that the education in high schools falls short. We are aware that we have great military spending, and we are aware that we dont provide much social welfare (like paid maternity leave) compared to some other countries. But heres the thing: we are still #1 in where it actually matters. We are tough people, and that is ingrained in our culture (despite what you see on MTV, and despite the sketches on the daily show). We value work, and we value good work. We push forward the frontiers of technological innovation. And for fucks sake, we have by far the biggest influence in the world. Why is this? It doesnt come around by giving women paid maternity leave. It comes because we are still one of the best in higher education, the one of the best in technological innovation, and one of the best in scientific innovation. Americans (amongst a few other countries) have pushed the frontiers of space exploration. We havent sent people to the moon and rovers to mars by eating McDonalds and being fat. We have the worlds biggest GDP (and before you start saying oh well its still not the best in GDP per capita, you cant really count some countries like Lichtenstein given that they such a small population. Its not easy to have worlds best GDP/capita when you have 300 million fucking people). Oh and yes, we dont provide great social welfare. Cry me a fucking river. People dont come to this country to jack off on government money. People come here to work hard and become billionaires. The american dream exists, but doesnt come easy. I get it though.

If an article cannot get the first sentence right, it doesnt deserve my time. Every bullshit claim about Benghazi that supposedly designated it a scandal have been false. Opponents of Obama said the White House politicized the talking points.

The White House had a mediator role and it was the CIA that edited the talking points based on input from the State Department. Then came the claim that the Administration and military abandoned the victims in Benghazi by telling troops to stand down. [Well, that was apparently false also](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/14/jason-chaffetz/rep-jason-chaffetz-says-special-forces-ready-save-/). I mean ask yourself, why would the military leave its own people to die. Use some fucking common sense. Lastly, they said that the Obama administration lied about the attacks being due to that controversial video.

26761156009,"Sure are a lot of people complaining. One of the great things we have in the US is choice. Choose what you want to do with the rules that exist. You know what another choice is? Living here. If you think it is so bad then leave to one of those other fabulous countries. I understand complaining and wanting change, but I have been to other countries (only a couple). I went to Ireland once. I loved it there. I learned the rules and saw how they live. Free education, free health care, benefits of work places such as vacation pay, and maternity pay for both man and female etc etc. They also pay like 50% of their wage in taxes. They also do not get paid the same rate, sure their cost of living is lower however their choices are also lower. The service was horrible comparative to the US. There are many many other rules and things that people just do not think about in the US. To get their drivers license it takes years to become a full license. Their gas was like $5 a liter, or something like that. Of course their cars are way smaller and go further per gallon, not many luxury SUVs. I kissed the ground when I came back from Ireland. That was just Ireland, think would it would be like in other countries, Ireland is a vacation. The point is, here you have many many choices. Yes, most of those choices are luxury. What other choices would there be? As much as you may hate things, the grass is not really greener on the other side. It is pretty easy to find out, visit other countries."

If you think forcing an employer to pay you for choosing to have a baby is a good thing, move to Canada. Its literally right up there. Im pointing north, by the way. If you actually think America is unusually violent, go away. Go away someplace safe like - as the graph states - other OECD. That sounds like such a safe country. If you think our health care sucks... well.. yeah. The quality of health care is among the best in the world. The system we use to pay for it absolutely sucks. Im with ya there. And I love the graph for Gas Guzzlers. Its not comparing America to the rest of the modern world or even the entire OECD. Nope. Its just high income OECD countries. In other words, its comparing a giant, diverse country like the United States with much smaller, much less diverse countries like Sweden (for example). And if you think the government should force - were talking FORCE here - companies to pay you for not working (vacation), then move to Austria. The Austrians force their employers to pay their employees for over a month of not working. All I ask is you LEAVE ANY REMAINING SENSE OF HONOR at the door when you leave this country because theres no honor in forcing another person to pay you for not working. And if you think there is a glass ceiling in America for women, youre an idiot. As a fellow voter, I cant vote for women if they arent running for office.

You can get crime down to pretty much zero if your solution is to start chopping off heads and putting cameras and chips in every person. Look at the vacation and paid maternity leave. Apparently were confusing the government mandating everything you do with freedom which is a really bizarre connection to make there. This has more to do with quality of life and pretty much absolutely fucking nothing to do with freedom. Highly socialist does not equal free. You can make a pretty perfect utopia but it would require meddling in everyones lives, requiring everyone to pay ridiculous taxes, and passing ridiculous laws. Say what you want, but the US government still (mostly) trusts its people with the right to own guns, and that represents more freedom than even a single one of these idiotic graphs, especially with regards to how much we drive.

This slipped by like a Trojan Horse and dismantled the establishment of global economics for American citizens. This tore a hole in the moral fiber of the people allowing for corruption to fester like a disease. Those born into the recent times of America grew to focus their efforts on social issues with a bias and anger also. Conspiracy, abuse, fear tactics, and falsehood have paved the last bricks on the road to a great nation, and have been laid in the wrong course. Greed took the wheel and America may only recovery if its citizens take part in fixing the broken headlights. Unfortunately, most are fed by the controlled media and are blind to their own abilities. If America falls like Troy, from the inside and burned to a memory, the rest of the world may fall with it. That is my fear. That the giant empire the whole world believed in a long time ago becomes its own enemy. If this happens, I dont blame the country (or countries) for ending the suffering and watching their missiles bring peace to the wage slave cogs we call Americans.

Also, the influence and power of one nation-state (e.g. US) could have disproportionate ripple effects on the economic, political and social well-being of many other nation-states in a myriad of ways. Those who are able to and feel they have the right to shape our realities use a much larger frame of reference (i.e. the looting classes of the world who make the bulk of economic, political and social decisions). Nationalism now, as in the past, is a useful propaganda tool for many conflicting interests. Most pressing problems we face are global in nature and require solutions of the same scope (implying collaboration extending far beyond nation-states). My issue has never been with American citizens, even the most jingoistic ones, as every country has their fair share of them.

We could see the bad liveability stats and things like rates of violence and the religious crazies having too many fingers into the government at various levels. Then there is the militarization of the police; the moves to curtail civil liberties; and the general erosion of the things that used to be considered the great merits of the USA. We thought that Obama might have reversed all the bad stuff that been contributing to the slide downhill. I imagine that despite doing a lot of good, there is only so much that even a dedicated and committed President can do against the inertia that exists in the US Federal Government systems. So it seems to be getting worse. And the changes that the Government is making (such as they are), dont seem to be addressing the underlying issues that erode the merit and reputation of the USA.

I make more then the maximum for medicaid despite access being raised because I make a 20k a year instead of less than 15.8k a year. So by Obamacare Im forced to buy insurance I cant afford. Yes I know you get a tax credit, but it wont cover it completely plus I still need to pay thousands of dollars out of my pockets for little more then a year before I get said tax credit on my tax return. Considering I live from paycheck to paycheck that means Id have to get a second job to afford to buy health care, BUT that means Ill be making more money which means my tax credit shrinks. The only way to avoid working a second job after the first year is to dedicate my entire tax return + tax credits towards health insurance. For me that means no more emergency funds for the year for rainy days, car repairs, etc. In the end if you cant afford it and working multiple jobs doesnt make it any easier youre only recourse is to allow yourself to be punished for being poor and not being able to collect welfare by paying the fine. And thats what theyre betting on. They want you to pay a large fine because its really just a tax in disguise and the government is piss broke. Trust me when I say Im all for many of the benefits this law brings us, but in its current state its broken as fuck. The only way to fix things and make it work is to have some kind of public option. Something like Credit Unions for Health Care is what we need so Insurance Companies have some kind of competition to force them to have competitive rates that are actually affordable.

Should we get rid of the pre existing conditions that insurance companies use to keep some people from getting insurance? Should we stop rescission? Should kids be allowed on parents coverage until 26? Should insurance companies have to spend at least 80 percent of premiums delivering health care? Should we stop insurance companies from dropping people if they get ill? Should there be no lifetime limits? These are popular. They are in the program. But that is not how the right is arguing it. The program includes a decision not to force employers to provide healthcare for part time employees. It ended at 30 hours.

Though I agree that what the corporations are doing is horrible, people act based on reward structures.

You can argue about whether or not thats moral, but that was the logical outcome given the way the law was written, and it should have been written better. "

26877224746,"If the ACA works it will destroy **their primary goal** of making Obama look like a failure. They try to pull this shit every time a Democrat is in office, but a black guy with a Muslim name has essentially opened the gates of GOP hell. The party is a joke. They wont be winning many more elections with this kind of behavior."
26876707730,"Universal , single payer is the only answer. That is where it will end. California is on its way there. The ACA has a provision that allows states to experiment with health care. California is leaning toward single payer."
26876660432,tl;dr: the ACA is much more popular than Obamacare
26877124393,"&gt; The program includes a decision not to force employers to provide healthcare for part time employees. It ended at 30 hours. So employers figured they could just end healthcare by making everyone part time. That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers. I was under the impression that the ACA forces employers with more than 50 FTE employees to pay for health insurance, whether or not those 50 FTEs come from 50 full time employees, or from 100 part time ones. I was under the impression that it is designed this way precisely so businesses cannot just cut employees hours to get around providing benefits. Am I wrong, or are you?"
26877142646,"You forgot the incredible money and power of health insurance companies, durable medical goods manufacturers, and drug companies. "
26876693966,"I dont want to detract from your point - its an excellent one, but if you think about it, allowing children under 26 on their parents plans is much like the 30-hr cap. Were requiring companies that offer benefits to subsidize companies that dont. I saw this firsthand when a co-workers benefit costs doubled after adding her 24-yo daughter, who is presently employed in (get this) the healthcare industry. Her employer realized an $8,000/yr cost savings by passing it onto my company. A much better answer wouldve been tax incentives for companies that pay healthcare premiums for their employees &amp; tax penalties (perhaps based on total work hours instead of F/T, P/T or temp status) for employers that dont. Pay the premiums or pay the taxes - your choice."
26876867144, So they should have made it so all employees regardless of hours would have coverage?
26876782927,"&gt; That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations. Yeah, but that was an outcome foreseeable by *every single person who has ever run a business*. Companies are in business to make money, if forcing every employee to work part time is cheaper than giving everyone healthcare, then thats what theyll do. If they have to provide health coverage, the premiums are going to skyrocket and the coverage is going to get worse. Is not offering your employees health coverage a dick move? Yes, probably, but in the real world you simply cannot legislate away dickishness. Even if ACA is going to help people who could not get health insurance previously get it, it has already ruined health insurance for people who used to have it. Why is that acceptable?"
26876868111,"Legal, ethical, moral, all terms that have nothing to do with the corporate mentality. It is about money."

I mean what are they actually claiming on TV that is bad about it?

26877132283,Not if you make them into 29 hour workers. 
26876660800,"The ACA is much more popular than Obamacare. In fact, if you watch Fox news lately, they are going out of their way to call it the ACA. "
26876775209," The part you ignore is the worker /company relationship. Companies used to pretend that they cared about employees and their welfare. Now it is clear. Workers are just problems and expenses to be controlled. Any way they can cheat someone is a good way. Some helped pay for health insurance. Now they have a way to escape that too. But it is not their fault. If you accept that companies owe nothing to workers, then you agree with them cutting hours to escape health care costs. It is just a business decision. there are no humans there, just Social Security numbers."
26876759155,"It was such an obvious move by corporations that it should never have been made law. A corporation wants to make money. If you make them spend more then they want to, they try to find a way to cut costs. When you make it as simple as just having your employees work for 29 hours, what do you honestly expect? This is exactly why Republicans talk about how government doesnt understand business. "
26876865838," That makes no sense. Companies have an option to treat their workers respectfully. Can you image they would want their workers to be safe from an illness destroying their lives? The ACA was no just a Dem dbill. The Repubs had plenty of input. Bills do not just appear one day. They are fought over in committees before they get to the floor. There are people arguing that since the Repubs did not vote for it all, they had nothing to do with it. That is incorrect. They just voted against it in bloc, like they frequently do. But they were deeply involved in the process."
26876793058,"&gt;That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers. People respond to incentives. This is undeniably true. So if you design a program that doesnt take that into account, you are either incredibly naive, or stupid. Its your call as to which the ACA is, but regardless, it *is* the problem of the program. In your case, you seem to take the naive route. EDIT: I guess the other option is that this outcome was *intended* by the ACA. I doubt youll argue that though, but for the sake of completeness I guess I should include it as an option."
26876914226," There was a time when companies did look out for their employees. If the company succeeded, the workers did. There were bonuses and raises when they did well. Now when a company does well, it all goes to the top. The worker/company dynamic is inimical. You work knowing the company is trying to squeeze you and eliminate you. There was a time you worked hard to help the company. You were tied to its success. Now no matter how much they make, your job is not safe."

26876994172,"This. Exactly this. Unfortunately though, Obama has not done a very good job handling these budget crises. Each time budget talks up they end up kicking the can further down the road, which only plays in the favor of the Republicans who can use it to hold another political issue hostage."
26877018961,"&gt; The ACA is not as popular as it should be, because the Repubs, Fox and billionaires are lying about it 24 hours a day. You are the kind of person that gives /r/politics its bad name. Numbers released by the U.S. Gov actually state that premiums will increase by an average of $130 in all 50 states. Every state will have an increase. The ACA gives itself a bad name. Blaming right wingers for giving a bad act a bad name is like saying Americans give a bad name to Hitler. The general ignorance with this act is free healthcare, which it is not at all. From what Ive been seeing on even nightly national news is that pushing obamacare to next year could actually help the program gain traction politically."
26877021934,&gt; It works. It has always worked. We have always been at war with Oceana.
26877036776,"Im sorry, but you cant blame its unpopularity only on fox and republicans. Part of the reason its unpopular is because Obama said that hell keep his promise that if you like your health care provider you can keep your health care provider. How can you keep your health care provider if you lose your health care provider because the company you work for drops them because its cheaper to pay the penalty and make you opt into the ACA? You cant. Thats just one of many lies Obama and democrats have told about the bill. One of the reasons I dont like it is because Congress has exempted themselves *and* their friends from it. Another reason I dont like it is because the federal government is wasting $70,000,000,000.00 tax payer dollars on a nationwide marketing campaign trying to put a happy face on this bill when people can see its not everything we were told. Another reason a lot of people dont like it is because the while time it was being pushed through Congress the president and democrats went out of their way to say its not a tax. Well, viewing it as a tax is the only way it got passed. People are sick and tired of being taxed. Basically, there are a ton of reasons not to be exactly stoked about this bill, none of which have anything to do with Faux news or republicans."
26877158714, Taxes are at 60 year lows. I can not get excited by people who dont want to pay taxes to keep up the commons. Our taxes are too low to maintain the infrastructure. Taxes for the rich and corporations have been getting slashed over and over since Reagan. You will not be satisfied until taxes are at zero.

26877152385," You are partially right for the wrong reasons. The fact is insurance companies only add cost. They make money not by delivering health care, but by denying it. That is a huge expense that should have been eliminated. "
26877140564," They wont be getting Blue Cross . They will get ACA, which will have lots of companies competing to sell coverage. How does Obamacare make Blue Cross more expensive? The ACA does not even go into effect until Jan 1. You can check policies out Tuesday. "
26877107824,My parents just got a letter from Blue Cross saying that their insurance just jumped from $552 to $1397. Thats over $10200 a year. This bill is VERY unpopular in my household right now. 
26877137340,You will have a lot of options in a new policy. There will be lots of companies offering coverage. You might see some real competition. 
26877119178,This is why the ACA isnt popular: http://i.imgur.com/dSgYEKN.jpg
26877122951,There lots of things wrong with this bill too. Its overly complicated and will cause billions in costs. The way they calculated part time to equal full time will hurt labor. The whole thing is fucked. Not a liberal law at all. 
26877135573, Where do you get overly complicated? It is a huge bill that has to describe all the options and rules. Do you think they just added extra words for some reason? It will save money in the long run. in the short run it has already slowed the growth in medical care costs. 
26877283382,The individual survey questions you ask are heavily biased in terms of wording. You can ask a similarly biased version of every question that would illicit the opposite response in the same person. Should people who elected not to purchase health insurance be allowed to buy it regardless of the impact their bad health would have to increase others premiums? Should we punish companies with more efficient insurance pools that are able to profit more than 20% of what they take in from premiums? Should people who committed fraud about preexisting conditions when buying insurance be liable to be dropped from their new insurance? The same measures are suddenly wildly unpopular. The right is putting dollars into TV advertising on the bill because the law was passed with a clause that allows Obama to use tax dollars to promote it (thats called propoganda).
26877324124,Yeah but the ACA turned into such a shitty bill. It started out so good but it was butchered completely by lobbyists. Id much rather have them rewrite it than keep it just because it kinda does something good.
26877639988," Wonder why the Repubs are fighting so hard/ Not because it will fail, but because it will succeed. If they really believed it was going to blow up, the Repubs would have provided the match. But they know ,if it works out, the Repubs are in serious trouble, The Repubs are concerned about elections and power. They care zero about your health care problems,."
26877411750,"&gt; That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, who saw a way to cheat their employees out of coverage. They obviously have little regard for their workers. It actually is the problem of the program. The whole point of economics is to understand incentives and how they work. The program creates a clear incentive to put people on part time work or fire full timers and hire more part time staff. Its inevitable that people will follow incentives, and its not just our system, its human nature. Writing a plan that relies on people doing the right thing in YOUR eyes is really just not writing a good plan. At least in that one regard. Dont get me wrong, I hate corporates for other reasons, but this is not the right time to say because corporations."
26877451450,"Im around some pretty hardline GOP types often, their arguments for being against obamacare are pretty simple: * I dont want to pay for someone else to get medical care - Well buddy you already are. * Its going to force me to do something - Youre already doing it and youre never going to stop * (from a few small business workers) NO ONE KNOWS HOW IT WORKS!!! - well yeah there will be some adjusting but Ill take some adjusting to the current shit storm we have now. The I dont want to pay for someone else is the one that always gets me. Its almost always tied to the lazy welfare queens with 8 kids get better medical attention than me! or something along those lines. They never take into account the millions of working poor that will benefit, they just dont want that one abuser to get something free."
26877636068," Reagan told about the welfare queen. The NYT spent 6 months looking for someone who filled out the Reagan claim. they could not find one. The whole premise is a lie, but works because some kinds of people are looking for an excuse to step on people below them."

27055046988,"&gt; Yes, people are signing up. But, like Social Security, it is based on the same flawed design. You are adorable if you think social security is flawed and cant be fixed with a minor adjustment. &gt; The ACA needs, and I mean NEEDS, young people to enroll. Correct. Did you know this is already happening and that the data has been released which proves this? Of course you didnt. Right wing diatribes *never* include data to support their claims. Let me help you: http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/obamacare-enrollment-demographic-breakdown &gt; This is, of course, assuming that the ACA will operate at break-even. Better than that, actually. Heres what the CBO has to say about it: http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43471 &gt; In fact the numbers appear to show that, in the not so distant future, premiums will have to increase for the ACA. Of course you dont say by how much, leaving it open ended to sow FUD. The Kaiser Family Foundation also released a report last month that concluded if 25 percent of the enrollment pool were young people, the resulting premium increase might be only 1 to 2 percent, not enough to fatally undermine the laws actuarial base. Please point on the chart where a 2+% increase (because Im a pessimist) would stick out seriously: http://origin.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2011/10/premium-growth.png "
27053933738,Whats flawed about Social Security?? Theyre only going to get 1.72% instead 2%? OMGWTFBBQ! I guess the Republicans will have to step up their Obamacare bashing - maybe then it will go OVER 2%.
27053946187,Social Security is a botched design? You just voided your whole argument by beginning like that. 
27053950580,"The same deal of young people contributing versus older people drawing out funds. When Social Security was set up the ratio of contributors to drawers was significantly higher than it is today. By 1955 the ratio was about 9 to 1, as of 2011 that ratio is more of 2.9 to 1, and expected to drop to 2.1 to 1, or even 1 to 1 by 2031 [LINK](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/fast_facts/2013/fast_facts13.pdf) check out slide 36. As for the difference between 1.72% and 2% (assuming the population is at 330 million) is about 1 million people. If those people were paying $200/month, that is $200 million dollars per month of lost gross income, or $2.4 billion dollars annually. All of a sudden that 0.28% looks a lot bigger. Edit: format"
27053924357,"Just to be clear, it is an assumption that the ACA is working. Yes, people are signing up. But, like Social Security, it is based on the same flawed design. The ACA needs, and I mean NEEDS, young people to enroll. Why? To offset the cost of paying for the medical expenses of older people. An older person might, for example, be paying in $200/month but using $600 /month. Thus, the ACA needs 2 additional people paying $200/month and using $0.00/month just to cover the expenses being created by the first person. This is, of course, assuming that the ACA will operate at break-even. Why cant it operate at a loss, you might ask? It can, but not in reality. The fact is that it can dig a debt hole to pay the expense, remember these expenses are going to third party providers and not just the Government moving money around within itself, thus the funds for payment of services will be going from the Government to, say, your local hospital. The money has to come from somewhere. That leaves the Government the following options: (1) print more money, pay with newly minted funds and increase inflation; (2) borrow money, by running over budget and increasing the debt ceiling (remember, those monies will have to be repaid by the tax payers as the Governments primary source of income); (3) increase the premiums of the people enrolled in the ACA, defeating the purpose by making health insurance less affordable. Yes, companies are realizing that by taking away employer provided health insurance they can reduce expenses and increase profits. And, yes, this most likely will mean for those employees who are already paying for health insurance, they will go out and find health insurance on their own, either from a health insurance provider or from the government. But that does not mean that the ACA is working. Heck, the CBO admits that they budgeted, and set initial premium, based on having an estimated 40% of enrollees being young people. Right now that number is at 27%, way, way below the estimate. Right now 3.3 million have signed up, which is about 1% of the population. They were budgeting for about 2% of the population signing up, but based on current enrollment statistics it appears that they will only get about 1.72% (approx) of the population enrolled. When not enough people have enrolled and the vast majority of those who have enrolled are not young people (73%) premiums will rise, or taxes will rise, to offset the increased cost of the ACA. Thus, it is too early to say whether or not the ACA is working. In fact the numbers appear to show that, in the not so distant future, premiums will have to increase for the ACA. They say, in the article, the 3% increase of young people enrolled in January is even more encouraging. But if that increase continues through the end of the enrollment period (end of March) the percentage of young people enrolled will only be 33%, or 83% of what they budgeted for. TL;DR: Whether or not the ACA is working is yet to be determined, it is too early to say it is working. Shortfalls in total enrollment and more especially, in the enrollment of young people, could drastically change the premiums being paid by those who have already enrolled for the worse."
27055616271,"I stated previous numerous easy ways to fix the future insolvency of the SSA. Thus, I do believe that it can be fixed. Not only that but provided various options to do so. I clearly reiterated the portion of the article which stated that the total enrollment of young people had increased from 24% to 27%. I did not know that it was designed to function at lower levels than stated in the article. Thank you for providing a link like I requested others do. As for the break-even comment I was not taking into account reductions in other government expenditures off setting the costs of the ACA. I didnt say how much because, honestly, I dont have the time or the resources to conduct a proper statistical analysis of the situation. But, it is reassuring to hear that others agree with me that premiums will have to increase. The chart is nice but it doesnt compare employer based insurance premiums versus non-employer based insurance premiums, which is what we are looking at with the ACA, non-employer based insurance (unless of course you work for the US Government). Thank you for providing sources. I appreciate it. It is reassuring to read that the ACA will not fail if enrollment benchmarks are not achieved. I believe that the 40% young people to be a very tough goal to achieve, simply because it is much more likely that the breakdown of the demographics for enrollment will more likely match the age demographic breakdown for the nation as a whole, based on shear numbers (for example there will be more older people enroll than young people because there are more older people than young people in America)."

They clearly state Social Security is not sustainable over the long term at the current benefit and tax rate. They further state that beginning back in 2010 they started paying out more than they were taking in. Sure they have a cushion built up, but how long will it last with the contribution rate continuing to decline and the payout rate continuing to increase. Know your facts."
27052751337,"&gt; Where do you get this stuff?

Of course, *Obamacare is simply so awesome and the reform so urgently needed for our country that Obama keeps delaying implementing much of it.* &gt;It was a one year extension. Nothing more. 1. The fact that it is still only a delay, as opposed to a permanent change, *is exactly the reason why the promise to be able to keep your plan is **still** a lie.* 2. Only delayed a year so far.

Im guessing it was an anecdotal judgment rather than a scientific one. &gt;History, again, will bare that out. It hasnt been so long since George Bush was president. It seems hypocritical for you to be so sure Bush was a bad president when history hasnt been there to bare that out yet. &gt;so what if its a bare minimum requirement You have such low-standards such that your opinion isnt very meaningful? &gt;I am not sure what a good president is, to be honest.

Got it. &gt;he did bring it back from the edge that the republican and a republican president pushed us to with de-regulation, wars paid for on credit cards, a hugely unfunded Medicare Part D implementation thats costs us billions every year. Please tell me how Obama re-regulated the part of the economy responsible for the financial crisis (most economists say the systemic problems are worse under Obama BTW), how Obama didnt pay for more wars on our credit card by continuing military action in Afghanistan, many years in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Pakistan, etc., and the Medicare Part D which Obama permits to *still* cost taxpayers billions each year. I find your comments both hilarious and sadly revealing. &gt;That has a lot to do with it. If you dont believe that, you are simply lying to yourself. Please show me all hard data you used to come to this conclusion. You seem to have such a high standard for judging Obamas performance, I cant even imagine what comprehensive data sets you are using to come to this conclusion. Unless you have double-standards of course. Little old biased me points to [surveys like these showing no major differences in racism expressed by either political party](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/08/racism-by-political-party.html), and I then I *lie* to myself to come to the wrong conclusion! I mean, there is no other explanation other than racism when [that majority of all those super Evangelical, racist Millenials say they would vote to recall Obama](http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/millennials-abandon-obama-and-obamacare-20131204). &gt;they SUPPORTED many of the policies until presented by a democratic president Besides the foreign policy stuff and the deficit, I dont think there is much else different compared to what the GOP base supported at the end of Bushs second term. You arent going to say the Heritage Plan from 20+ years ago which I already debunked, are you? If you really want to see an epic double-standard, try looking at how quickly Democrats reversed their opposition to the temporary Bush Tax Cuts when Obama signed them into permanent law, or their embrace of the security state now that Obama and not Bush is in control of the drone assassinations. &gt;Let me know when Obama hits a 77% disapproval rating OK. So Bush was an ok president for Americans when his disapproval rating was 76%? 75%? Again, you sadly resort to the comparison game instead of accepting that a president can be bad on their own without being as bad some other guy. [A presi"
27052352239,"&gt; You fail to understand what seemingly every fact checker in America understands. The ACA intentionally makes it near impossible to have a plan grandfathered; the intention was to have these plans cancelled from the beginning. Where do you get this stuff? Do you make this up? There was NO intention. It was well know that it COULD well happen, but there was no intention. What the fuck would the purpose in that be? &gt; I guess he did anyway to try to compensate for his epic lie (though it looks like at the state level they are refusing to enforce it). It was a one year extension. Nothing more. Again, a way to ease the rollout. Didnt work well, given, but it still had to be done. Just like a lot of other tweaks they had to implement. Its an ongoing process, just like the rollout of Medicare Part D. Its going to take a while to get it right. &gt; Newsflash: most Americans think Obama is an awful president too, even worse than where Bush was at this same point in his presidency. Theres a huge leap. Just because someone doesnt currently approve of the job hes doing, doesnt mean hes an awful president, no matter how much you want to believe that. I dont approve of the job hes doing, but I certainly dont think hes an awful president. When he succeeded an awful president. I have a pretty clear stick for measuring and he dont make it there yet. &gt;Translation: Republicans presented even worse candidates, so Obamas awful policy choices and mistakes dont make him a bad president. Hmm, I wonder why that is, maybe they dont have any good candidates? Or maybe the republican base has lost its fucking mind, listening to the constant drivel coming from the mouths of Rush, Beck, and Hannity. &gt; It doesnt make him a good president. Certainly most Americans disagree, and I would think their judgement is more important. It doesnt make him an awful president either, it just doesnt. History, again, will bare that out. &gt; This is a bare-minimum expectation, not some sort of profound achievement, though I would largely say that attributing responsibility for economic performance to the president is fallacious most of the time. LOL, so what if its a bare minimum requirement, he did bring it back from the edge that the republican and a republican president pushed us to with de-regulation, wars paid for on credit cards, a hugely unfunded Medicare Part D implementation thats costs us billions every year. &gt; Is your bar for being a good president really that low? Well, seeing that the only decent presidents in my lifetime were a democrat, and a completely neutered republican(Bush I), I am not sure what a good president is, to be honest. I thought for a very long time that Regan was a great president. However, after really going back and looking at his record on human rights, the economy, and many other areas, I determined that simply wasnt the case. He was a fair president at best. &gt;Clearly the majority of Americans who think Obama is a bad president only do so because he is black, That has a lot to do with it. If you dont believe that, you are simply lying to yourself. White Republican Evangelical America was not ready for a Black president. Everyone else was, but the bible belt certainly was not. There has been a complete lack of support for ANYTHING this president has done since he took office. The republicans came out on the day(or maybe it was the day after) his inauguration and said we intend to make him a one term president. And they did everything they could for four years to block everything he supported, even IF they supported before he did. Its been comical watching the republicans for these last few years contradict themselves time after time after time just so they could rail on the president for this or that. To be honest, given the resistance to everything the man has done, I think hes done a pretty good job of TRYING to work with the recalcitrant republican party. The republicans have been a disgusting bunch the entire time he was in office. And I believe history will show that as well. Once the books are written it will be talked about how he was able to get anything done. &gt; as nothing to do with awful performance, and supporting policies that half the country is opposed to. Again, the point is they SUPPORTED many of the policies until presented by a democratic president. Its that simple. it really is. Im surprised he got anything done at all. &gt; You really cant stop doing it, can you? Nixons approval rating before watergate was quite high. Hes judged based on his actions in watergate. Was Nixon actually a bad president or does his scandal define his presidency? On the merits, Bush WAS awful: http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/roper/presidential/webroot/presidential_rating_detail.cfm?allRate=True&amp;presidentName=Bush Let me know when Obama hits a 77% disapproval rating OK. &gt; I have sometimes flirted with doing this, though I suspect for different reasons. I would not doubt its for different reasons, I would expect that, but the fact that you even thought about it should tell you something. That party has lost its way and is destined to be a player only in local elections, which trust me, is a powerful place to be. Just look at what the loonies are doing to my beloved North Carolina. Look, I have no illusions that Obama is an awesome president. I DO fully believe he is a better president than Bush was. That being said, I have some serious bones to pick with him about transparency, drones strikes on Americans, furtherance of the Patriot Act and media targeting. But I think he brought some worldwide respect back to the office of the President that Bush pissed away. I think he took many of the right actions on the economy, to repair the immediate damage. Obama will not go down in history as one of the great American presidents. That being said, he will not go in as one of the worst either and had he had a republican party that would work with him, even in the slightest, it could have been better. However, that was not the case, and he had to work around the current piss-poor republican contingent and that hampered his presidency. Thats not an excuse, its a fact. "
26818534804,You will find pretty much no examples of a CEO being ousted. Theyre all quietly forced to resign to save face for the CEO and the company.
26818562869,&gt; Plenty of companies pay their employees more than they have to - everything from Costco to Google - and shareholders love them. Actually the CEO of Costco mentioned that Wall Street thinks hes overly generous to employees. http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/costcoceo.asp
26818602678,"&gt; Wall Street thinks hes overly generous to employees. The quote says Some Wall Street analysts. Of course there are some who feel that way, but that doesnt mean its representative of anything. Wall Street analysts dont have much influence over how shareholders vote, especially when a company is performing well. Costcos stock has outperformed the Dow Jones by a wide margin over the past 5 years. Id say thats a good indication that overall, shareholders are extremely happy with Costco. "
26818598494,"Exactly - but by their own board, not by shareholders. "
26818416218,"Bullshit. Its extremely rare for shareholders to actually vote to oust a CEO. Name a single example of where a CEO was ousted because they wanted to invest more in their own employees. Plenty of companies pay their employees more than they have to - everything from Costco to Google - and shareholders love them. The only thing likely to happen if you cut into profits to increase salaries is that your stock price will go down *in the short term*. If it improves employee retention and customer loyalty, though, the stock price will go right back up again, in line with expectations of future profits. "

HE did run on bipartisanship, and then immediately told the other side to go get bent ( actual quote was we won, we dont have to compromise ) . He also ran as a disruptor to the status quo, and first thing he did was open the coffers to his buddies for payback and assurance that it was all campaign rhetoric. Oh, and transparency . You cant really judge a president as bad while he is still in office, but you can judge as dishonest on some big issues, all of which were to attract the moderate vote. "

I hesitate to call myself a democrat these days, even though Ive been heavily involved in the party and acted as precinct committee person for a while there. It was actually my involvement with the democratic party that made me hyper disillusioned with it. The other regular democrats, the people I worked with were awesome and genuine. But when I started moving up enough to get to know our representatives, and the major contenders running for office - I honestly wanted to take a fucking shower after every encounter. I couldnt believe that bullshit charisma can take slime so far. And it blew my mind that my fellow workers would fall in line, blinded by those twinkly smiles that held no substance. The only time I ever actually got a reasoned and insightful response when I dove deep into policy discussion was from a woman running for the school board. I worked my ass off to get her elected. But everyone else just sidestepped questions or tried to snow me with bullshit soundbites. But lots of smiles and really attractive spouses and kids in tow. It was a fucking parody of itself. Politics. Never again. EDIT; I want to make very clear here that Im not saying Dems are worst than Republican politicians. Ive had a few encounters with Republican politicians that were pretty much identical. The thing that killed me about hanging out with most politicians is that they obviously didnt have a fucking clue about what they were talking about, and didnt even give a shit about not having a clue so long as most people thought they had a clue.

26871169042,"This is what happened when the Soviet Union collapsed; insiders under-valued state companies, then bought them at low prices.

Richard Ellis (CBRE). Hes essentially implying that all of Congress is conspiring to privatize the USPS so that Diane Feinsteins husband can make money. Right... Its being slowly bled to death because Republicans incessantly hammer the budget issue because its an easy target, and the Democrats arent going to use political capital over it. Feinsteins husband may be improperly taking advantage of the situation, but its still definitely true that the USPS is struggling to stay relevant from the pressures of technology and slashing government services. The government should continue fully funding it because its a vital public service, but instead they will string it along with a broken leg just like Amtrak."

They really are (on the whole) looking for some justice and some truth. The republican party? Absolutely not. They seem wholly incapable of grasping the truth...certainly they are almost totally averse to the idea of the truth at all at this point."

26871212302,"Ill repost this response to this Feinstein crap, again here. My contention with the article is that it doesnt give credible enough proof that CBRE has actually been selling the properties for less than they were worth at the time. I hate Feinstein as much as the next rational person. I did, however, somewhat defend the decision to choose CBRE to dispose of the PO properties as they are on anyones list of companies to do the same in the private sector. However, having CBRE do the appraisals and then sell the properties is complete bullshit, if true. There is no way whatsoever that that is an acceptable practice. OTOH, some of the charges in the article are specious: * CBRE appears to have repeatedly violated its contractual duty to sell postal properties at or above fair market values. Not sure anyone is going to be selling much property above Fair market value. Determining FMV in 2010 and 2011 is a crapshoot, especially for special use type property, office buildings are a little easier, but if a major or 100% tenant is moving-out, determining absorption rates in that market is not a science. * CBRE has been paid commissions as high as 6 percent by the Postal Service for representing both the seller and the buyer in many of the negotiations, thereby raising serious questions as to whether CBRE was doing its best to obtain the highest price possible for the Postal Service. This is standard industry practice, perhaps even a bit light for commercial transactions. * CBRE has sold valuable postal properties to developers at prices that appear to have been steeply discounted from fair market values, resulting in the loss of tens of millions of dollars in public revenue. That is clearly a guess, by their own admission as they dont have the appraisals and in most markets assessed value =/= FMV. * In a series of apparently non-arms-length transactions, CBRE negotiated the sale of postal properties all around the country to its own clients and business partners, including to one of its corporate owners, Goldman Sachs Group. * Senator Feinstein has lobbied the Postmaster General on behalf of a redevelopment project in which her husbands company was involved. Those two stink. * By way of explanation, an assessed value is normally based upon the most recent sales price of a parcel, which is likely to be less than its current fair market value. Those are not necessarily true, either the independent or dependent clauses, especially in the worst real estate market in generations. * When there is shortage of commercial real estate in developable areas  which has been the general situation, nationwide, for several years  demand tends to push prices far higher than assessed values. There is almost always a shortage of developable areas in a downtown, but demand only pushes prices higher when there is, in fact, demand. Again, 2010-2011, are horrible years for real estate demand in most markets. Someone in this thread mentioned that the NYT is going to have a field day with al"

The country needs to adapt to ever changing situations and be flexible enough to realize that we dont live in the same world that the founding fathers did.

26868426088,Thats not what I am trying to say. My point is that people cling to things that are outdated and dont really have a positive influence in the way the world works today. 
26868371627," I agree with this to a degree. It is a different time with different issues, and the original laws dont stand; in most cases. But it is important to remember the ideology this country is founded on. Its not straight democracy, a dictatorship, a fiefdom, or whatever-else. The founding fathers debated what it should be, until they came to the decision that a government should guarantee as many liberties as possible without endangering the rest of the populous. It was perhaps the most forward thinking political philosophy of the time (dont give me shit about the Magna Carta, it was important as well, but it became important years after it was written). My point is, its important not to come to rash decisions. Its not likely that anyone (intelligent) would do this, but suppose was voted in that guns could be sold by anyone, anywhere. That goes directly against this founding philosophy, as it can very easily endanger people. Making guns illegal would very easily endanger a liberty. Again, I cant stress enough that youre right about the same laws not applying. But I tell you, the philosophy does. In a time where our country is weakened by bureaucracy, debt, and corruption, the only redeeming advantage is our bill of rights and our founding philosophy. NOTE: Dont ask me about the gun control issue. Its a complicated matter with no real, solid answer."
26868361095,Smoking tobacco until you die is a personal choice. Being shot to death by someone with legally purchased weapons is not. Guns are not irrelevant and they are not a sensation. They are a problem that we must deal with.
26868442722,Thank you.
26868320622,Same goes for the tradeoff of personal freedom and privacy. Its 2013. We live in a world of suitcase nukes and dirty bombs that can make cities uninhabitable. I would gladly trade some privacy for safety. All the founding fathers had to worry about were muskets and bayonets.

26868840511,"Common sense seems to be in short supply, obviously."
26868399941,"We have the First Amendment to speak freely, think freely, assemble freely, and expand our freedoms freely all without fear of punishment (but there are logical limitations like how you cant yell fire in a theater or bomb on a plane). We have the Second Amendment to protect the first. The right to bear arms is a law of rebellion against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The founding fathers couldnt predict full autos, and I support FAWB because why would we need a full auto to begin with? - to fight the corrupt government? Yeah... about that... the military trains their soldiers to fire one shot at a time; the infantry hardly use fully automatic weapons. So, to get rid of the AR-15, a semi automatic rifle, because it is occasionally used by mass murderers is an illogical atrocity used by self-serving politicians to gain brownie points off of a terrified populace. FBI crime stats show a decrease in violent crime over the last several decades; most violent crime is perpetrated by *hand guns, not rifles*. Therefore, if anything was to be banned, it should be hand guns. But theres no media cry to ban them; theres no congressmen talking about banning pistols; and even when they are banned (like in Chicago and DC), it doesnt stop criminals anyways. Guns arent safe. Nobody with any sense swears that. But people kill people, guns are just a tool. And theyre being scapegoated by a society hellbent on banning them because its politically convenient, when in actuality the mental health of every shooter needs to be examined *and* we need to get *that* in check. **TL;DR** - Guns are tools; people need their heads examined; handguns are used to kill more than AR-15s; dont ban AR-15s because CNN shows politicians saying we need to ban AR-15s especially when the stats dont support the claim.

Horrible, but another argument against the rhetoric. And if you really want your mind blown: one of the weapons used at Columbine was the [Hi-Point Carbine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Point_Carbine), which was designed in accordance with the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban passed under Slick Willy (I miss the days when a blowjob was our messiest problem - bazinga). Second **TL;DR** - Im also sick and tired of people saying its not 1787, so lets stop being in love with the Founding Fathers and the 2nd Amendment. My response: We have the 1st to protect the rest; the 2nd to ensure we keep the first."

26824974285,I can agree that a minimum wage that goes back to the 86 increase and adjusts it to inflation would make just as much sense as a middle class tax cut. Both seem like good ways to create more spending capital for average citizens. And in the case of raising minimum wage it would have the added benefit of adding additional taxes to our system since income tax would get a few extra billion for the government. Maybe doing both in tandem you would produce a net zero situation where the extra money in from raised minimum wage would pay for the tax cut to the middle class.

In a libertarian society, this would be a crime, and there would be people who are held PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE for their criminal actions in this crime, starting with the person who pulled the lever, and working up the chain of command. To imagine that this is some kind of libertarian problem misses the point - this has nothing to do with libertarianism - it doesnt exist. Regulations against this are unnecessary because it is inherently criminal to pollute property that does not belong to you. The regulations exist inherently. Dumping waste into a river is an infringement without the need for regulations. To say that regulations would have prevented this misses the point. An actual system of justice where individuals in corporations are held liable would have prevented this but because theyve signed a piece of paper with the government, the government chooses NOT to hold them accountable - and worse, the government will likely limit their liability. This is not a libertarian problem. This is a government problem."
27048264431,Coordination problems abound when it comes to pure libertarianism. The Non-Libertarian FAQ: http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html
27049078683,"Ronald Reagan used to claim that regulations are unnecessary because the threat of lawsuits is enough to keep corporations honest. But corporations regard suits and fines as simply the cost of doing business, and of course their bought-and-paid-for legislators (and corporate justices on the Supreme Court) are always making it harder to sue. To paraphrase the old saying, We have the best government *the highest bidder* can buy."
27048712099,"On the other side of the coin, if the current government allowed fines required to completely clean up this mess it would in many cases lead to bankruptcy. If the same thing happened to BP, they might potentially go out of business and other companies would think twice about being careless with toxic chemicals. "
27048357200,I never trust anyone who has that much faith in people running things to not fuck things up without someone looking over their shoulder.
27048187728,"Libertarians always argue that government is incompetent and cause massive environmental damage. This river is polluted due to lax regulations. Who was lax with their regulating? Government was. If the river was privately owned and operated, it would be cleaner. The worlds biggest single polluting entity in the world today is the US military. Historically, the worlds worst polluter was the now defunct USSR. Private companies cannot hold a candle to the amount of damage to the environment governments have caused. "
27048117266,"same thing could be said about abortion, in regards to birth control and education."
27048164946,Why dont you google where duke energy spends their lobbying funds...
27048433882,"You are absolutely correct. However, it should come as no surprise that many Libertarians take such a position when their beliefs and research are largely fueled/funded by some of the worst corporate polluters in the country...the Koch Brothers. "
27048118618,Ill just get my coal powered electricity from another coal company! Oh wait. Something something monopoly
27048077017,&gt;proactive regulation of corporations I dont see how regulation would change the outcome. If anything the corporations will stuff the regulation board to get what they want anyways. Im sure the residents of the area would rather pay a corporation or environmental group directly to monitor the pipelines than put together a regulatory board that isnt accountable to the taxpayers.
27048102597,"You are on some treacherous ice. Reddit is not the place to bash libertarians. When their mothers wake them up at 2:00 PM after a long night of updating their Illuminati-conspiracy blogs, you are going to be in for a world of hurt. "
27049000842,"The company should just get their coal ash out of the River... No matter the cost. Thats pretty simple, why dont we make them do that? "
27049198515,"Besides, the notion that people will stop using the services of a company they dont even know the name of - which is the norm in these cases - is ludicrous. Even when they know its Duke Energy, how the hell are they going to avoid it? Is it even possible to get their power from someone else,and if it is, how massive is the hassle? It would take something incredibly egregious to make people go through all the rigamarole of changing and in many cases its not even possible because people are dealing with monopolies or oligopolies. Those are the expected end result in any sort of capitalism, especially the libertarian approach, so the libertarian fantasy of a reactive system is not even reactive, its a mental fantasy construct that is innately invalid."
27048442568,"I think the libertarian answer would be that if you see X people died because of a company, those not affected would boycott them in the future for their actions, after that happened a few times no company would need regulation, living in fear of boycotts. When you consider how bad some companies behave though, especially utilities, which cant be easily boycotted, and how many companies either ignore boycotts because they cant reach critical mass, or engage others to counter the boycott (buying extra to make up for it as in Chick-Fil-A or Girl Scout Cookies) it seems that boycotts are very seldom effective enough measures to change anything a company does. The only thing companies are motivated to do by bad press is to try to limit reporting."
27048059340,Libertarians argue that [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) applies to companies because they are not being shielded from risk and therefore are prone to act responsibly. Of course in practice...lmao
27048151950,"It works perfectly, thats why people stopped using BP and Walmart."
27048042122,"My problem with libertarianism is that it is inherently *reactive* when corporations do bad things. Libertarians are usually very quick to say that if a corporation does something bad then people will just stop using the companys services. But that is a *reactive* decision. Which doesnt help if the corporations *killed* you with poison from contaminating the water supply. Contrary to what libertarians would have you believe, there *is* a need for *proactive* regulation of corporations actions in order to *prevent* certain catastrophes from even happening in the first place. "
26713024446,"Although I agree with this point, its just about the only campaign promise he has attempted to keep, from what I can tell. I voted for the jackass to promote open government, then he decides to prosecute whistleblowers, promote privacy-eroding bills, and give immunity to the very people and corporations who are destroying this country for the highest profit."
26713128479,Thanks for the post. Ill take a look at those.
26713129903,"Third party. Yes, it throws away your vote, but that doesnt make it a bad choice. The throw away is only for a single election, but in the larger metagame of voting it can have a positive effect. If the Dems see their constituents leaving to vote for a party that better represents their beliefs, you can bet theyll either change or die."
26713038778,Now there is a lot more that he kept than that. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-kept/
26713062389,"And now who do we vote for next time? No way Hillary Clinton would be a better choice for the issues you mentioned, and obviously the Republicans are similarly unsuited. Things are bad."
26898603855,"Not that it matters in hindsight, but the budget surplus was a product of a Republican Congress working with a second term president. It was not a Democratic achievement, it was an American achievement."
26898702781,Thats kinda true. The deficit skyrocketed in Obamas first year (I think we all remember his first 100 days in office)... and he has reduced it from the mountain peak he brought it to himself.
26898680380,"Simple math. The national debt had increased 6.5 Trillion dollars since Obama took office. He has been in office about 5 years at this point. Therefore, the average yearly deficit (money added to the national debt) has been over 1.3 Trillion dollars for every year he has been in office. During Bushs years, the deficit was only about 625 million a year. The debt only rose 1.5 trillion during Clintons entire time in office. I dont see how anybody can even start to argue that Obamas presidency hasnt seen the worst deficits of any president the US has ever had."
26898611514,And everyone always fails to remember that Bushs last fiscal year was a $1.5 trillion deficit year (2008). The GOP and media conveniently and falsely attribute that as Obamas first year.
26898712474,"We do NOT want a balanced budget amendment. That is a perfect way to absolutely fuck over an economy long term. A nation needs to be able to borrow money, lots of money, tons of money, during a recession. In a recession, tax revenues plummet and spending needs explode. This is why we had trillion dollar deficits for awhile. With a balanced budget amendment, you cant do that. Your only option is to retain a massive emergency fund, which for an entity the size of the federal government would be $5-10 trillion dollars. Do you really want the government owning that much in assets? Do you really wanting the government owning a significant fraction of the nations stocks and bonds? More importantly, proper emergency funds are almost impossible to maintain politically. As soon as you get a large surplus to start filling them, some demagogue Republican comes riding into office, promising to give the money back to the people!!"
26898765225,Do the math. Clinton had a surplus. The debt went up under Clinton. Smoke and mirrors.
26898440795,"I saw a lot of that during the shut down. Lots of Repubs claiming the deficit was rising, quoting trillions of dollars. Conveniently they keep confusing debt and deficit. The debt will continue to rise so long as we keep running a deficit, and will shrink once we have a budget surplus. The thing that drives me crazy is that there was surplus under Clinton. GW wasted no time getting rid of pay go. Started two unfunded wars and a medicaid expansion and a tax cut to boot. Repubs better look themselves in the mirror before pointing fingers elsewhere. Facts show that under rupub rule, deficits increased. Mr Obama has reduced them. Those are simple truths. Id be happy to have a balanced budget amendment. Problem is theres not the political courage cooperate and make hard choices."
26898874034,"The odds of the US running a budget surplus ever again seem mighty slim. I think the system will crash well before this happens again. The US is not in a growth stage of its life cycle, it is a mature developed economy which should not be looking to grow but to be self sustaining at this time. A constant desire for growth will utterly destroy our ecosystem and it is simply not feasible. When people realise this, a crash will happen because those debts are not getting paid and all will be chaos for a while. After this I hope we take a new direction with the way we view progress- get rid of the capitalist system and focus on needs of all rather than the wants of the priviliged. "
26898479338,Find a year where Revenue was greater then Spending under Clinton and Ill buy you a month of Gold. GW also inherited a market crash that was responsible for a decent chunk of that debt. He also raised spending but it wasnt entirely his fault.
26898607781,"&gt; Facts show that under rupub rule, deficits increased. Mr Obama has reduced them. Those are simple truths. Except that those *arent* simple truths. In fact, the second part is a lie. Mr. Obama is running much higher deficits than Bush did. In only one year (the start of the recession) did Bush run higher deficits. The other 7 years, the deficits were much lower. "
26898713250,Shutting down the govt did raise the deficit slightly.
26898458254,&gt; The thing that drives me crazy is that there was surplus under Clinton Not really. It was accounting gimmicks so they could use it as a cheap talking point. Dont think for a second it was just because there was more revenue than spending. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/23/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-his-administration-paid-down-deb/
26939335211,"Wait times are better, oh no more people must be dying then... oh wait... The Commonwealth Fund report shows somewhat fewer reported physician errors, lab errors, medication errors and duplicate tests north of the border, and Canadians report more satisfaction with their doctors. General health is also better up north, according to the World Health Organization: Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy are both higher in Canada; infant mortality is lower, and maternal mortality is significantly lower. There are fewer deaths from non-communicable diseases, cardiovascular diseases and injuries in Canada... http://www.factcheck.org/2007/12/comparing-health-care-in-canada-to-the-us/ Also, your insurance company CANNOT LEGALLY deny my coverage based on my medical needs, which means it doesnt matter what my risk analysis is. And in so far as cost, single payer costs FAR LESS than private insurance, which means if this is PURELY a matter of cost as you seem to make it, SP wins in a freaking landslide. Canadians pay about 11.4% of national gross domestic product (GDP) to insure 100% of citizens in their single-payer system, compared with more than 17.4% of GDP to insure 85% of Americans. According to the latest available data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in 2009 healthcare expenditures per capita amounted to $7,960 in the United States compared with $4,363 in Canada. http://www.the-rheumatologist.org/details/article/1457997/A_Comparison_of_the_Canadian_and_U_S__Healthcare_Systems.html"
26937682550,"You are not paying for me when I buy insurance. No other person pays for me when I buy insurance. A company does. The company decides which people to let into their pool, but my rates dont go up because you have cancer. Your rates dont go up because Im fat. The process is personal and individual. You can live or die or be injured or be healthy and it will have no effect on me whatsoever. With single government payer healthcare, my rate does go up if you smoke, or have diabetes. The government cant discriminate (as in, decide whether its worth it or not) services from one citizen to another like a company can. With private insurance I get the chose whether I want to mitigate my own risk. With government insurance, I have to pay whether I like it or not. Healthcare can be likened to building a house. When you buy insurance youre saying, Build me a house and tell me now what its going to cost. Single paying is like saying, Build me a house and tell me later what it happened to have cost. Nobody gives their contractor a blank check to build a house. Nobody should give their doctor a blank check to heal them."

They will announce that its acceptable for banks to do business with marijuana dispensaries. This is the groundwork. Which is huge, really. If the banks can do it, that means were just steps away from marijuana being rescheduled. "

27020124489,"Obama is trying to create a new source of tax revenue while cutting DEA spending and prison spending. This is all about money, not about how harmless it is as a drug. Then once it is legal on a federal level, Monsanto will genetically modify the stuff to make a seedless strain and Obamas mission will be complete- to make sure only the right people get rich off sales of mj. And , of course, people will try to save their seeds and grow their own, but Monsanto bribed legislators will make sure that homegrowers go to jail for longer than moonshiners currently do. "

27020145131,"&gt;Finally, and most notably, Obama said of the two states experimenting with legalized marijuana, Colorado and Washington, that it¡¯s important for it to go forward because it¡¯s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished.¡± And yet the DEA is still raiding medical marijuana dispensaries and small growers in every state. Am I the only one who finds this to be incredibly hypocritical? Isnt this a bit like Hitler getting up there and proclaiming that racial tolerance is a good thing?"

I used to smoke copious amounts of sinsemilla back in my first year of college and just want to point out what my relationship with marijuana did for me and for many people I know. Take a shitty situation, like being incredibly bored, or having family/friends do something to really upset you¡­ You smoke a joint and feel better about it. If you are okay with this then by all means, toke on. The reality is that the issue is likely to still be there when you come down. Now comes the point. While I am 100% for the nationwide legality of Marijuana (hell, throw psychedelics in there too) I feel like something is quite amiss with Obamas half-assed endorsement. I feel like he is testing the waters to see how the nation will react to these statements. If he were to go all out pro-marijuana, that could severely damage his reputation. I understand this is his last term, but I guarantee he still cares about what the history books will say about him so he will still tread lightly when it comes to subjects like this. My biggest concern is that he is using the legalization of pot in one of the most concerning times in the history of this country. The surveillance state is seemingly unchecked (even with the Snowden leaks,) there were a minimum of 7,000 drones in 2012 (which has surely escalated,) a"

27020163792,"Then legalize it at the federal level, or at least let dispensaries in states where it is legal access to basic banking services. "
27020164725,"1. Rescheduling it is within his authority as president. If he believes that its so important for it to go forward, he could at the *very* least do this. 2. I really dont want to hear anything about him endorsing it. A lot of conservatives are coming around to a more libertarian mindset, and if he endorses it then there would probably be a turnaround on this area due to people not wanting to be on the same side of an issue as him.

27020194178,...because it¡¯s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished. I wish theyd take this approach to speed limits.
27020194263,Its weird that he is only coming out in favor of this issue after numerous polls show that the majority of Americans agree that pot should be legalized. 
27020196512,"Seriously, anybody whos against legalization at this point either has no idea what theyre talking about or refuses to listen to the truth. The most important thing that I can even mention is that nobody should EVER dictate what YOU can and cant put into YOUR body. Its ridiculous! We are all sovereign human beings who want to be free. How can you call yourself truly free when big brother is telling you what you can and cant put into your own body? "
27020197479,"You know he didnt want to be the first black president and the first dude to legalize pot. Its becoming such a hot topic with the states legalizing it, and he he is getting pulled into the debate."
27020198202,"Be more clear with rhe headline. I was stoked because i thought he was in favor of legalizing, but hes still not."
27020198387,"You know, it feels like this whole pot thing is a smoke screen for the NSA stuff that was making the news previously...."
27020199058,"As much as I have supported legalization for the past 20 years, I do not trust these people. There has to be some ulterior motive - These are the same people who were busting down doors, killing people and pets and ruining lives with moral arguments and rationalizations not a year and a half ago. Whats the deal?"
27020201436,Then why does DoJ keep busting legal dispensaries on his watch? 
27020202252,"Another perfect Obama move. He has against marijuana legalization in the beginning. Once it started to move forward, he just kept his mouth shut to see how it would play out. Now that the public has shown support for it, he speaks out all for it. This man is spineless. He cant make a stand for anything. Whenever he has spoken in absolutes, they have been proven to be lies. "
27020202344,Okay. So when can I smoke weed legally?
27020204791,Of course it is important to end the war on drugs. We have real wars now so the fake one we made up in more peaceful times is redundant. All of those wasted resources can be used on the 100% real war on terror.
27020206191,Why do they have to refer to it as pot? 
27020209366,This is just to take the topic of his worthless NSA speech. Looks to have worked. 
27020214017,"I know Im a little late to the game here, but this headline is a little misleading. Obama specifically said that its important that Colorado and Washingtons law go forward, not in general, meaning not busting down on them. Its a good experiment. "
27020218749,"Too much money against legalizing it. Does anyone think Pfizer wants you to grow your own painkiller? Not good for profits. If anyone wonders why something does or doesnt happen, remember the root is almost always money."
27020219093,It¡¯**$** important for it to go forward.
27020223978,Hes just doing this so people like him again.
27020223986,Nobody cares what the Presidents *says*.
27020224637,"I just hope when it is legalized, we see less of the kinds of people who revolve their lives around it. You know the kind. The ones who will paint a marijuana leaf in their wall, have weed bumper stickers, be called something stupid like w33dsm0cker420, and the ones who always talk about it. The ones who use it as a substitute for an actual personality."
27020224937,"Obama felt a huge wave of sympathy towards the gays and therefore became pro gays. He now feels a huge movement for legalizing marijuana, and thus becomes the friend of the nationwide potheads. Judging the love American whites had for the blacks during his time, if Lincoln acted like Obama, the Thirteen Amendment would have never met the senate floor."
27020227175,"While at the same time he is still ordering the DEA to raid legal dispensaries. Obama is blowing smoke. Just like he did when he promised to stop launching drone strikes against civilians, when he promised to stop DEA raids *5 years ago*, when he swore the government wasnt spying on US citizens, when he *promised* to close GitMo... and on, and on, and on. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-broken/"
27020228430,But Im betting Obama will just sit on this comment long enough that he will leave it up to the next president to really make that decision. 
27020231663,VERY good politics by the White House. Obama Administrations low-30s approval rating is due in part to young voters dismay with their surveillance policies. Not a coincidence that the Administrations position is being clarified now. Though remember the Justice Department said they would not challenge the Colorado and Washington state legalizations. 
27020232428,Its not like he has another campaign he can lose. 
27020236094,Translation for everything Obama has ever said about why legalizing weed should happen: $$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$$ :P $$$$$$$$$$ $$$
27020241712,its important because we can tax it....i mean to go forward or something

27020253322,"Sooo...if you say its important to go foward, then do something about it already!"
27020253348,"I dont get why people think that Obama saying this has to do with the NSA thing or tax revenue. He said at the beginning of his first term that he wouldnt challenge a state decision to decriminalize marijuana. If you read his statements on weed I believe he obviously wants to support it but cautiously so he doesnt alienate people strictly against it, which is a big reason why marijuana legalization is coming so slow. Politicians are hesitant to support it. But now that the attitude of the people is largely shifting in support of marijuana legalization politicians like Obama are sloooooowly changing their public position. But I wouldnt be in the least bit surprised if he were all for it privately. He just doesnt have the backbone to come out and say it outright."
27020254637,Theres this little thing called an executive order...
27020255530,Oh really?
27020255982,"This is all political postering. Obama isnt gonna change shit. Theres too much money, (jobs) tied up in illegal drug enforcement, he doesnt want to be the first president to give that green light. Obama is a master at saying all the right things at the right times and not doing shit about it."
27020260125,Obama is a douche 
27020261401,"He was talking about the Experiments that are Washington and Colorado, not legalization itself."
27020262795,Talk is cheap.
27020264021,Whens the last time Obama claimed a stance on an issue *before* the public already clearly spoke their opinion?
27020264258,"I cant help but notice that the government is taking over the shady businesses. I predict the legalization of prostitution next, with the proceeds going to the IRS. Who controls the spending of all that collected cash? That would be bad guys of just a different type."
27020266897,"I was listening to Fox News on XM and they were talking about this. One woman commentator said something like, woah, this is some dangerous talk from the President. He had better check his facts about the green stuff before making statements like that. Its anecdotal at this point! And if we really want more facts, lets allow for more studies!!! Gah. "
27020268246,Obama has done nothing to legalize it. Hes full of shit. Hes just talking. 
27020268595,"So no one gave a shit about Obamas executive orders on gun control, or the NSA spying on US citizens, but everyone cares about Obama talking about legalizing marijuana? "
27020268802,Obama says a lot of things and does absolutely nothing. hes a great politician.
27020270461,President Obama on pot legalization- Gettin me summa dat GOOD Denver kush!
27020272155,"Now we need to retroactively correct the sentences of those wrongly convicted and sitting in jail or marked with an unjust felony. I know this is politically complicated, but this is vital to begin talking about. The Drug War has been Jim Crow 2.0 as far as Im concerned."
27020273598,Yeah lets forget about all that NSA. WHO WANTS TO TALK ABOUT LEGALIZING WEED? ^^^easily ^^^distracted ^^^muricans
27020275378,Stop your DOJ from going after dispensaries in CA then maybe??
27020275731,There go my people. I must find out where they are going so I can lead them.
27020275747,Looks like theyre going to do this. 
27020280210,Please. This is just a ploy to get the current Gen of 18-35 year old voters to stay with the dems because of the NSA and big brother fiasco. 
27020280651,Its all bullshit until I can smoke weed without the possibility of doing jail time because of it. And stop bombing kids ffs.
27020282236,Come on Obama¡­now youve done nothing I agree with. Oh well. You were better then Romney. 
27020282406,My SOPA sense is tingling....

27020285239,"This is proof reddit is used as a propaganda machine.... I mean who in their right minds still even cares about what obama says.... this is like knowingly listening to a child who has a fixation with lying.... What the fuck is this reddit? Hes lied about every other thing hes said, Why wouldnt he be lying about this? Posting his name does nothing but give him publicity....."
27020285586,"Every time this is posted, his quote is shorter and shorter. Less context shows more overt support. "
27020287357,"Im so fucking sick of hearing this. Its nothing more than an empty gesture. If he really wanted to change it he *would*. The fact that he has had one of the more strict policies on marijuana, and has passed on several pardons that would have backed this kind of talk, lets you know its all Bullshit. Just like everything else he says. "
27020287765,Too little too late. He lied during his 2012 campaign and became even more tough on MMJ than Bush43 once in office. Too little too late. What a hypocrite.
27020288300,"Hello misdirection, it seems as if only yesterday you were telling me that obama was going to end the wars. remember wiretapping? lol that was so fun, thinking that it was this seldom thing that only happened to important people."
27020292258,Maybe the government is using this to distract us from whats really going on...
27020294908,US Government got all 1984 on our asses now they are giving us our Soma. Its like they use dystopian novels as a guidebook.
27020294917,"Obama deciding to legalize pot now is like your father saying you know I love you, after he beat the piss out of you."
27020295498,"This is what I elected you for, with my own vote!"
27020299382,"I dont often agree with Mr. Obama, but I do on this particular issue. I just cant help but feel like he is more motivated by the politics of it than by it just being the right thing to do, which sucks."
27020300245,... for us to invade syria
27020302443,"What the hell does he mean Middle class kids (ok im 24 and white not a kid...)dont get locked up? I was in jail for almost 30 days. I had no way to pay bail and my family in NY or NJ all acted like i was fucking criminal and wouldnt help me out. In an overcrowded cell using some plastic boat thing to sleep, with a dude who got arrested with meth and some 19 year old who robbed houses for money to buy dope.PEOPLE GO TO JAIL FOR POT . "
27020306114,Pretty big about face from the asshole who raided more medical marijuana dispensaries than GW Bush. 
27020307823,typical political hypocrisy http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/other/223693-obama-defends-action-on-medical-marijuana-dispensaries
27020308824,"Oh no, now what is Gary Johnson going to be smug and sanctimonious about in his AMAs now? Without that tiny moral high ground, he has literally nothing but Steve Forbes flat tax. "
27020312383,"Ive always respected the president, hes made a lot of mistakes and backed some questionable legislation. But this is a step in the right direction, a small step towards the end of controlling peoples private lives and I fully agree with it. "
27020313207,This is the same guy who spying on all of us...
27020314612,"Less talk, more action."
27020315747,Im excited to see who gets elected next presidential election.
27020321867,"Hes all talk. Always has been.... I voted for the guy because Romney would have been a disaster, but hes just another empty suit like the rest of them. "
27020323701,"Its simple. Obama is waiting until there is a huge military operation overseas that he doesnt want people reading about in the news, and BAM!!! Legalize Marijuana... the entire country will be so distracted about a plant that can grow anywhere, that they will not see or hear about the thousands Obama slaughters somewhere in the middle east."
27020325337,Thanks Obama
27020327962,"You know whats really important for Obama? For people to focus on things that doesnt really matter. He is trying to avoid focusing on the major issues that he is partially responsible for. Like the massive debt, deficit, wars, future energy issues, global warming, QE, poverty, fascism, his numerous lies, NSA... the list goes on and on. But as long as the people have something else to focus on everything is fine, pot, homosexuality, democrats vs republicans (they are both the same), religion, terrorism... basically any topic that can be debated FOREVER."
27020331082,But its important to the slave industry that it goes backwards.
27020332085,I honestly do not understand why people like president Obama. He is a media whore with absolutely no conviction wholl change on a dime if it benefits himself. 
27020335008,Never more relevant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlxkcewBEe0
27020335323,This is big stuff coming from the President ... yes hes cautious in his words but he has to be. Can you imagine a President Romney saying the same thing? Romney would have the feds cracking down on Colorado right now. It annoys me when complainers never acknowledge good things.
27020336714,Can we create a potpolitics subreddit and move all these stories to that so I dont have to hear about everything anyone has ever said about pot ever?
27020336865,&gt; ¡°We should not be locking up kids or individual users for long stretches of jail time when some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done the same thing.¡± 
27020336986,"He allows the NSA to spy on my, but fuck it, have an upvote. Also my phone kept trying to correct NSA to NBA. Is that racist?"
27020337084,Translation: the Narcotrafficers are becoming so rich and powerful that we would like to weaken them and usurp one of their profit sources.
27020338817,"I feel like Obama has a minimum popularity threshold to support any topic. Not that I disagree with legalization, its just why havent we heard about this until now? "
27020339137,Were going to keep spying on you even if youre two steps removed from a suspected terrorist. Local law enforcement might even be able to get this data and the circumstances to accessing metadata is dangerously vague... *Buy hey you might be able to get high legally maybe soon.* 
27020341218,"Gotta love the people shifting the goal posts. Obama doesnt support legalization? Hes not leading, transforming the way we want. so many young men have their lives ruined by simple pot possession. Obama supports legalization? Ah, erm, hes probably just doing it to take attention away from the NSA spying. I dont get how people dont understand that, if you dont support people even when they change to believe in your position, dont be surprised when fewer people change to support your position. "
27020342182,Seems like pushing for decriminalization wouldbe a more logical and achievable step in most states
27020352980,"&gt; Those who argue that legalizing marijuana is a panacea and it solves all these social problems I think are probably overstating the case. Youre wrong, President Fucktard. It is a perfect solution. The only flaws that exist are those where someone *partially* legalizes it. Where they legalize use, but not sales. Where they legalize sales, but fail to regulate it sanely. And this is true of all drugs, not just marijuana. We could bankrupt the cartels in a days time, if only we legalized, coke, heroin, and meth. Put them out of business already."
27020354672,"Im against pot legalization personally, but Id rather the country move on and focus on real issues even if it means legalizing pot."
27020359506,"A politician going with popular opinion?? Wow, so brave. "
27020359604,"My goodness, if only there were a high ranking elected official who could push this forward. If only."
27020361530,"He has the power to do it right now but will he? Talk is cheap. We need action, not words."
27020366066,How about on of those executive orders he loves so much 
27020366769,Shhhhh. Your going to confuse the republicans. They wont support legalization if you do too.
27020370156,How weird is it to actually agree with something Obama has said lately? Now Im all suspicious and wondering what his angle is.
27020370392,But he wont do anything. 
27020374842,"Listen. Im a man who can compromise. Look, were in this together. OK? Sure, I said I would decriminalize Marijuana and stop wasting DEA resources on prosecuting state offenders. Then, I reneged. But look, - listen - this is about the right decision for millions of hard-working Americans. Thank you, God bless."
27020374938,How I see this: Obamas supposed reforms of the NSA didnt have the effect they desired so theyre throwing us a bone to make us think if they can reform their ways on pot then theyll be able to reform the NSA. 
27020384146,"Would it be too much to ask to have cheap, select-fire weapons in one hand and some dank, legal bud in the other?!?! Figuratively, of course."
27020385420,This is one of the most sensible and logical government related headline in a long time!
27020397511,"Hes doing all this pot-talk to distract us from the NSA issue. Seriously, how many headlines have you seen on Reddit the past few days involving Obama swaying something pro-marijuana?"
27020397743,"If his record of getting things done is any indication of the future, weed wont be legal for a very long time."
27020399874,Didnt you guys fall for this already? 
27020409977,"If hed politely get the fuck out of my way, Ill grow me an Eden."
27020418742,How brave of him. He comes out for gay marriage and pot legalization right after polls were released showing more than 50% of Americans approve of those policies.
27020426301,"He is going to close guantanamo bay too, amirite?"
27020427143,So hes still not admitting that he currently smokes cigarettes. What a piece of shit. 
27020431534,/u/wikibot what is whisky speak?
27020438805,"Come on Americans, you can do it! If you prevail then Canada will follow in your foot steps!"
27020439245,This is probably the first time where I voted for an incumbent politician about whom I had serious misgivings and ended up glad I did so instead of sorry I did so.
27020441972,"Any politicians strategy, no matter who it is or what party he/she is from: Give a speech about how important it is to do something. Doesnt do it."
27020455761,God forbid he actually show some leadership about anything 
27020458124,"Thanks, Obama. "
27020460833,"~~legalization~~ I wish more people would use the term decriminalize instead. Calling for legalization makes it seem like we should have to beg permission from our government to do anything, that we should only be allowed to do things after proper clearance and approval. *Decriminalizing* makes it more clear that the government was overextending itself in appropriately."
27020467089,"Just so no one gets the wrong idea, he was talking specificially about the states that were legalizing it, and not about the status of the drug on a federal level. &gt; Finally, and most notably, Obama said **of the two states experimenting with legalized marijuana, Colorado and Washington**, that it¡¯s important for it to go forward because it¡¯s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished."

27020485446,"I think this may be a huge win for democrats (Im independent). It seems like a pretty large majority is in support of legalization. And if conservatives tried to dig in their heels on this topic during an election cycle, it could really sway some swing voters."
27020493809,"So you found out we spy on you. No, we aint gonna stop, but here, try some pot. If youre high you wont care what we do."
27020494379,"Obamas a pro at saying what people want to hear. But hes telling the truth this time, right?"
27020500394,"Coming from the guy who promised less strict regulation only to increase the number of busts on dispensaries, sure."
27020501275,Its easier to run a tyranny when the citizens are stoned stupid and lazy.
27020501958,Dont let this distract you from the spying.
27020506634,"Well Obama, since you yourself used marijuana and cocaine (by his own admission) and never got caught, and turned out ok enough to be the president, how bout this: As of RIGHT NOW: we cease ALL arrests for possession alone. We could be arresting the future President, after all! If you think it should remain illegal, I expect you to turn yourself in for felony cocaine possession charges. Maybe Obama wouldnt be so dismissive if he was one of the countless minorities labeled a criminal forever because of a joint in his youth? Oh, but then hed never have become President to begin with!"
27020509552,GET THAT CAKE
27020511455,"Im becoming a single-issue voter when it comes to marijuana policy. I literally dont care what else their platforms are, Ill vote for anyone who is pro-legalization at this point."
27020517742,More like its important for it to **grow** forward.
27020518854,"¡°Middle-class kids don¡¯t get locked up for smoking pot. Very not true, especially if they get money from parents and do it again for a secondary offense."

27020545608,Illegal is illegal pot heads. Its the law ACCEPT it. 
27020553709,Fap fap Obama.. Just to check.. Got a job?
27020557119,dont forget that that this is the same Obama who also said in the same speech: &gt;marijuana is a drug with high potential for abuse but no accepted medical use
27020558393,You are insane if you believe that President Obama wants to legalize cannabis. Hes had the FBI raid more state-legal medical farms than any other president combined.
27020560243,"ITT: Oh, hes for pot! Lets totally ignore all the stuff we were mad at him about yesterday."
27020560858,"Luckily because of the internet restrictions being passed, they can afford to let pot and gay marriage go as distractions while they shit on the american people."
27020565646,Re-Leagalize Cannabis. End the War on[some]Drugs with Harm Reduction the cure. Peace.
27020566860,I hope one of the last things he does is push through legalization otherwise it might be years before it happens if a republican gets elected
27020568006,The Feds are killing Net Neutrality and leaving the NSA alone. Now theyre pushing legal pot. Connection? Hm.
27020575953,"Well, Ive been putting all that effort into upvoting every single pro-legalization post I came across for all those years, and finally it looks like it begins to pay off. Thanks Obama."
27020591238,Thanks for taking 6 years to make only a statement about your election promise to liberalize pot regulation
27020597996,"A stoned, gun free society is easier to control."
27020600777,Itd be nice to not have to fear being arrested for possessing a plant
27020603974,"I dont want to sound like one of those Legalize it activists, however i have absolutely no problem with the use of recreational marijuana. Ive never smoked it, nor do i intend too in the future, but legalizing it would boost our economy and keep a steady cash flow into programs other people could benefit from. For example, im a disabled vet.... If legalizing the stuff would help ensure that i keep receiving much needed treatment from the VA.... Then im all for it. "
27020607681,Wag that dog Mr. President!
27020612615,"Fix Net Neutrality, then worry about pot. "
27020623670,WE DID IT REDDIT
27020624474,Hes just saying that to increase his reputation.
27020627871,Strange. During his campaign when the majority of Americans said marijuana should remain illegal he didnt support its legalization. Now when the majority of Americans DO say it should be legal he changes his stance... I cant remember if thats for certain but thats what I remember from his 2008 campaign. 
27020630174,Why are the comment scores being manipulated?
27020632430,You lucky Americans - meanwhile we cant even buy booze after 10pm here in NSW (Australia) anymore ... looks like ill be filing for a greencard!
27020636785,Loot our country dry on wars you promised us would end if elected. They never did. But hey your going to let us little people smoke pot! So rad!!! 
27020647511,"Forget about the surveillance into every facet of your lives. Forget about the ramping police state. Now let me be clear, marijuana is not as bad as beer. Forget about the DHS tanks and bullets. Forget about the conspiracies proven. Forget about the gun and drug connection to Mexico. Make no mistake, marijuana might have some medical benefit. Forget about the federal reserves policy that will inextricably lead to a giant bond and stock crash. Forget about the nationalization of health insurance. Forget about the manipulation of metals, manipulation of libor rates. Let me be clear, making marijuana accessible to adults is acceptable if they choose to consume it.

The War on Drugs has probably destroyed as many lives as any war engaged in by his administration. Maybe more. Last time I heard, the average sentence given an American citizen for murder was around 6 1/2 yrs, while the average given someone who sold an ounce of pot was around 9 1/2 yrs. Nice try, B.O."
27021193610,He thinks everyone is just gonna forget his bullying of states that were legalizing and all the bullshit in Cali? What a dumbass!
27021220739,Wow. So if Obama literally said &gt; Those who argue that legalizing marijuana is a panacea and it solves all these social problems I think are probably overstating the case. Then that means he thinks marijuana might be a panacea the solves all these social problems. I mean he took the time to qualify his dismissal of such an idea by saying probably. So it stands to reason the he thinks it just might be so.

This is one nation, not fifty. And everyone in it should have one, single vote with a value exactly equal to every other citizens single vote. How difficult a concept is that?"
27139476908,"Im a little surprised actually that a democratic governor and legislature would commit to this- because it means theres a possibility of NYs votes going to a republican, which would otherwise never happen. I do agree with them though- time to get rid of the electoral college. "
27139477998,"the electoral college is so archaic that i have no clue why it persists. Its a dinosaur, and the sooner we get rid of it the better off well be."
27139309803,The Electoral College system was designed to send delegates from each state to vote appropriately back in a time when nation-wide voting was unfeasible... Logistics now (and for the past century) make nationwide/popular voting possible. No need for the Electoral College anymore. This needs to be addressed!
27139476073,"The problem is that pretty much every state thats signed off on this so far is solidly blue; given the math involved, it seems like this is only likely to get to 270 if a couple of bright-red states like Texas sign on too. Rationally, this benefits non-swing red states as much as blue ones - Texas and Georgia would get just as much extra attention as New York would if this became law - but the fact that this would make it harder to prevent D votes from counting (through voter ID etc) and that and that it still feels a little bit like a stab at Bush v. Gore means that were probably a ways away from a point where they might get interested. The best thing that could happen for NPVIC would be for Hillary to win the electoral vote but lose the popular vote in 2016 - if that happens then well get to 270 EVs within a matter of weeks."

27139718384,This means nothing until we get rid of the First-Past-The-Post system. Electoral colleges arent really the problem.
27139764405,"Thats great, but the larger injustice we have in our democracy is the congressional districting system we use to select representatives. In theory, the reps are supposed to have a direct connection to their constituents. In practice, few people even know who their reps in congress are. We would be far better served by a more parliamentary system where representatives are chosen as a proportion of the popular vote, rather than a winner take all system. "
27139179462,"This thread is showing a lot of talk about tyranny of the majority vs. tyranny of the minority, but if we abolish the EC wouldnt that potentially give rise to viable 3rd party candidates?"
27139132281,"I cant wait until enough states sign on to this then it gets overturned by the supreme court because every vote should count! Redistricting ensures my vote is meaningless unless I am in the majority party in my district. The electoral system is broken, let it die already."
27139619142,"I think were all making this too complicated. Ive always thought the easiest solution to too much money, corrupt intransigent representatives and limited presidential candidate choice is just to completely eliminate parties. This would be especially great on the local and regional level where people wouldnt be able to vote straight ticket. If you had to actually know about the candidate youre voting for or be confronted with the fact that youve just been blindly choosing whoever is in the party column I think itd lead to a more involved constituency. Also if interest groups couldnt just dump money into the red or blue piles then itd make it easier for more middle ground and nuanced candidates to stand out. "
27139511364,This would be huge for voter turnout.
27139611083,How is this going to be fair to smaller states? What is the point of voting in a state like North Dakota if your votes are dwarfed by a state like California? I thought that was the original point of the electoral college?

Congress has consolidated power in the hands of the 435, we need more citizen representatives not politicians in Congress. http://www.thirty-thousand.org/"
27139473096,A bunch of states have introduced legislation that tackles this problem in different ways. In addition to the 11 states (including NY) that have already joined the [National Popular Vote Compact](http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/) there are a handful with proposed legislation to join. New Jersey (a current member) has proposed legislation to quit the compact and Utah has a bill to allocate electors by congressional district (Maine and Nebraska currently do this).

27139145638,"To anyone who thinks this is just large states trying to drown out small states, consider the following. In the 2012 election the candidates [spend 88% of their advertising budget](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/track-presidential-campaign-ads-2012/) in the 8 swing states. Those 8 states make up only [18% of the countrys population](http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/11/politics/btn-swing-states). For perspective, the [70 largest cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population) in the US combined have a similar population size. They come from over 30 different states. So if we had the national popular vote and a candidate campaigned hard in only the 70 largest cities in 30 different states and won every vote in them all, they would get to 18% of the 50% required. Yet with the electoral college a candidate that wins just 51% of enough of swing states wins. So, removing the electoral college would actually **increase** the number of cities and states where candidates have to campaign. Furthermore all voters in politically polarized states would then have a say in the election. This is a good reform for basically everyone not voting in Ohio or Florida."

27139359786,"This is great an all, but what prevents a state from violating this compact? Suppose we had this in 2000. Al gore won the popular vote by about 500,000 votes. So, the interstate compact goes into affect and the states that signed on to this are supposed to vote for al gore. But, Florida decides they dont want al gore as president and instructs their electors to vote for bush and they violate the interstate compact and George bush wins the electoral college. What happens then? Also, what happens to unfaithful electors? Suppose the electors themselves want to vote for whoever they want? "
27139379222,"Youre really gonna wish you had that buffer. Is Rhode Island the same as Virginia? This does not make it more fair, it falsely equalizes the interests of every state ignoring all pertinent facts or unintended consequences. Its populist and short-sighted. But cuomo is batty so no surprise there "
27139392119,"So, basically you would be removing the power of states (EDIT: as comparable entities) from elections? If every vote is equal to one another, than its fairly obvious that larger states *will* have a greater say in elections. It literally defies the reason we have an electoral college. "
27139415700,The United States is not a democracy and it was never designed to be one. We are a Constitutional Republic. Majority rule is two wolves and a sheep deciding whats for dinner. 
27139424345,"To those arguing for this who say their vote doesnt matter, there are better things you can do than get rid of the electoral college. First, in just about every state there are a lot of ballot measures that make your vote actually count. Even in the most liberal or conservative states ballot measure have the chance to go against the grain. Governors and representatives are important too and generally have a bigger impact on your day to day life anyway. If your presidential vote doesnt count...VOTE THIRD PARTY!!! It wont change anything, but if we can get a candidate or two some major attention, you might actually change the course of the debate in the two parties. Love him or hate him, Ron Pauls run the last couple of years has done wonders for the conservative party. They are softening on many of the issues that made them repugnant in the first place and this wouldnt have happened without the influence of people like Ron Paul. Ralph Nader and Jill Stein on the left are helping progressives in the same manner. Give them your vote and let their voices be heard or felt at least marginally. "
27139434795,Id rather have proportional electoral votes (as opposed to a winner-takes-all system that most states have). This keeps the electoral college in place as a buffer. I dont want to be ruled by a mob.

27139505510,"Im fine with this, but it should be enacted at a Federal level. There is a reason that a state that leans Democrat is being targeted for this change. If youre getting New York votes, give us some from Texas."

27139520841,"I think we should reform the Electoral College, not get rid of it. By that I mean delegates to the Electoral College should be required to vote for the states winner. Getting rid of the college is just another way to get rid of the continuously diminishing checks that the States have on the democratic majority and the federal government. It is a threat to liberty."
27139526792,"At first I figured it wouldnt matter much until every state does it, but when you look at how it actually works, it turns out that it only takes a few states on either side of the red/blue divide to do this to completely eliminate the chances of the popular-vote winner from losing the electoral vote. This is because any realistic scenario in which a popular-vote-winner loses electorally generally has a close electoral loss."

27139579895,"This compact is never going to survive long term. If it does go into effect, it iss inevitable that at some point, one or more states are going to have their electoral votes awarded to a candidate that did not win those states. Voter anger in those states will put sufficient pressure on those legislatures to back out of the compact, or on Congress to nullify the compact. Additionally it is hard to see how the Supreme Court could uphold this compact if have voters in state A directly electing their electors by state vote, but the electors in state B are awarded not based on voters in that state but because of popular vote totals in other states. While states have the discretion under the Constitution to determine how to award their electoral votes, it seems like this situation may present an equal protection issue between voters in state A vs. state B. Finally, in a situation with a close popular election, the incentives for voter fraud to amp up the vote totals in states in the compact goes through the roof."
27139584795,"Id rather have a system, where each candidate gets an electoral vote, based on the voting preference (outcome) of the congressional district. The candidate with the most congressional districts of the state, thus gets the remaining electoral votes of the state (2)"

27139601700,"I agree with ending the current electoral college model. I think the states should still allocate their points to the appropriate candidates but based on the votes not as a winner takes all model. I dont agree with a single popular vote because it would only take one corrupt or fanatical district to swing the results. Each state should represent a percent (relative to the population), but its BS that a single state, lets say California or Texas becomes one big single party vote. This would solve the swing state problem and the results should be nearly identical to the popular vote. I would support the popular vote over leaving things as they are though."

27139628592,As a non American can anyone ELI5 the electoral college? 
27139635548,"The electoral college is still a better system in my opinion. Due to the fact that we have a single member district system, you have two parties that compete for the majority of votes (Duvergers law). This then allows us to run two major parties who have credible bases with established amounts of members in Congress. If you take away the electoral college, you can ensure that more parties will run. While this is good because more people will turn out to vote for a vast array of candidates, over time this will allow for situations in which we have a President who only received 30% of the national vote. The increased amount of publicity for the smaller parties then opens the door for more radical groups (yes even more radical then the tea party) to start to get there name and brand out there. After establishing credibility, these groups will then be elected to congressional seats. If you think two party gridlock is bad for congress, image a multiple party congress in which there is no real majority holder and no coalition in order to try to establish some order. Lets just say that our system could not handle such an option. "
27139639226,"Id say the college does have a purpose in the event of major national confusion...just be sure to elect/appoint trustworthy colleagues. Id be more interested in ending Gerrymandering without sacrificing third party possibilities (California == fail, nice try but still fail)"

New York joins campaign to end Electoral College role in presidential elections except by being a winner take all State, you have every negative of the Electoral College, and none of the positives. Our Founding Fathers are smarter than you and smarter than me. The EC is integral to our government. "
27139661894,"This is a start, but this isnt the biggest problem with our elections... We need to get rid of corporate donors and large pact groups and lobbying donations.

27139679801,Im emailing this article to my history/government teacher that I argued with constantly about whether or not to get rid of the electoral college. Im from Nebraska so his argument was that we would get even less attention than we do now but we already get none. 
27139684203,Increasing the campaign range is the last thing Id want. The drives and deals to increase their funding would be more insane than they already are.
27139692563,"The Electoral College in its current form does create problems. A middle ground between popular vote and the current EC is to have every district have 1 delegate. Basically that instead of NY getting 29 (not sure if still is for next election), each NY district gets 1 equaling 27. "
27139698729,"With the two party system, does it even matter?"
27139715077,Damn it. I really dont want to vote for Cuomo in the next election but now hes done two things I like (this and standing up for charter schools). Personally I believe it should be a system where you have to a majority of every single electoral county in the country. Presidential elections shouldnt be decided by who can simply win the major cities in the big electoral states (mine included).
27139715456,"I hope they campaign to end it as a whole country, and not as the state, it would be the stupidest thing to do if it is just ny, split vote counts as percentage will give more votes to republican since ny is mainly democratic vote. "

27139724730,"I would rather they make the process of becoming an elector simpler. It is there for a reason, we arent supposed to be a democracy, but a democratic republic. The electoral college is meant to deter mob thought, and it would be more useful if the electoral college actually made its own decisions now and then rather than following the popular vote. Thats what the house of representatives is for, true representation."

27139788154,"Is it wrong to want to keep the Electoral College for the same reasons the Founding Fathers wanted it? As in acts as a buffer between the people and the President. Is Hamiltons fear that a tyrant could manipulate public opinion not a valid one anymore? &gt;It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations. It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief. With an Electoral College the danger of manipulation of citizenry is removed is it not? In other words it acts as a check on an electorate that might be somewhat guided or duped by the elite/rich/possible tyrants. Or what of Madisons take that the general public was too easily influenced by passions or even too stupid or uninformed and for that reason a buffer was necessary? "

27139804076,"I know that this is supposed to force candidates to travel to all states as opposed to swing states, thereby forcing them to adores the needs of of everyone, no matter how small the state, but I dont see how this does anything but make the problem worse. Sure, states like Florida and Ohio wont get half of the campaign effort, but cities like Manhattan or LA would certainly get a great deal more effort than my home city of less than 60,000. "
27139804845,[deleted]
27139807801,I thought the reason the founding fathers came up with the electoral college was to prevent the majority from making a bonehead mistake and electing a bad candidate. It was a compromise between those who wanted a pure democratic vote and those who wanted an appointee and did not trust the populous.
27139812343,"One of the few maxims that has any validity is to be careful what you wish for. Im one of those who actually thinks the Electoral College is particularly important if you care about separation of powers, especially when youre a Union of States. Its not my own metaphor but I believe its dead-on balls accurate. There isnt a person in the world who doesnt understand the winner of the World Series is the one who won the most games and not the team that scored the most runs. This is a perfect analogy to the election of the President by an Electoral College. Simply put, it makes the contest a truer test. Its pretty much undeniable, but go nuts. "
27139814710,the giant media companies in LA and NY would love for this to happen. they dont get enough campaign money since it is pointless to spend money in places that are entrenched. 
27139817342,"This doesnt actually end the role of the Electoral College. Electors will still be chosen and the Electoral College will still decide the presidency. It just changes the way states decide their electors; they will be deciding their electors based mostly on votes that actually happen in other states. For states that do not want to participate, it changes nothing. They still may appoint the same number of electors as they had before by whatever method their legislature chooses. So states that do not sign on to this compact get just as much say in the election as they have always had. This is just a clever way of ensuring the Electoral vote goes the same way as the popular vote. If thats the way those states want to choose their electors, I dont see how any fan of the constitution or democracy could object."

27139833695,"Yes, yes. Witht he stupid electoral college you can win presidency with just 25% of the population voting for you. 75% against will have lost and they are the majority. This should have been done a long time ago."
27139836135,Republicans are already scrambling to narrow the vote as much as possible to fight off the inevitable tide of changing demographics and disdain for their platforms. They would fight this tooth and nail. 
27139841754,"In high school we learned about the Electoral College and my first thought was thats the dumbest shit Ive ever heard. There are a few good things about it, but they are heavily outweighed by the bad."
27139852414,"So, basically, if Im a candidate I can skip New York and campaign in all of the other states since the winner of the popular vote nationally gets Mew Yorks votes. If Im a voter in New York, my vote means even less than it did before"

27139890444,Forget just getting rid of the ECV system. Bring in proportional representation.
27139901452,I dont know why anybody would fight this. One person one vote makes too much sense. They also should move election day to the weekend so people dont need to miss work. Just this shitcunts opinion. 
27139901564,Heres a map of states that have enacted this and those which are pending: [MAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartogram_NPVIC_Current_Status.svg)
27139905756,I have mixed feelings on this on one hand I dont want electors being the real deciders of the election. But at the same time I question the political savy and ignorance of the masses. Such a complicated issue. 
27139907085,I would like to see something to help out third parties as well. (ranked voted or some proportional representation) Going to a straight popular vote might help them in current swing states but with a pure popular vote I dont think youd get situations like 10% for Nader in Alaska in 2000.

27139926381,"As a New Yorker, Im not happy about this. Instead of trying to find a way to fix the electoral college, it looks like were just gonna pretend it doesnt exist when it still does. So now my vote counts for NYs electoral votes, but someone in a different state has their vote count for their states electoral votes AND for NYs? Doesnt seem too fair to me. "
27139940023,Any big red states considering this? 
27139940809,Id like to know if all the people that are opposed to the college also oppose the bi-cameral legislature we have.
27139952437,"Although Im all for this, my concern is that the Republicans would just expand their vote suppression activities throughout the nation rather than focusing on specific regions. As weve seen in recent years, its much harder to prove someone isnt playing by the rules than it is to break the rules, so in essence the Republican strategy will scale much better than those trying to stop it, especially given the fund-raising boost they just received from SCOTUS. Given that, doing something about gerrymandering would, I think, have a much more positive effect than this on making sure the voter actually has a say. That would affect not just presidential elections but every election down to state ones by making districts much more representative of reality. A popularly elected president with gerrymandered Congress cant be very effective."
27139971392,Can they also go back in time to when Bush boy was elected and give it to the popular vote winner instead?

27140067775,"I think the system is a good balance as it is The house scales with population, the senate has equal representation regardless of population, the electoral college is weighted based on the # or house/senate representatives it would shift too much power away from the states the federalist structure would be unbalanced"

27140134900,"My state senator wrote a thoughtful article explaining his vote against NPV: http://willbrownsberger.com/an-unpopular-vote/ . I still dont agree with his position. But after reading this, I do respect it. "
27140144882,"While a national popular vote is certainly a legitimate method of electing officials it manages to award much greater weight to areas of high population density. In short many of the candidates would focus heavily on the northeast and west coast since most of the votes are concentrated in those areas. Smaller, less densely populated states would be ignored to an even greater extent to the point where rural interests are no longer represented. Presidential platforms would more heavily benefit urban projects and infrastructure to the point that the rural voice would be lost. "
27140147387,"Im all for scrapping the electoral college and going to to direct elections. In recent elections, candidates ignore both small states and large states if theyre dominated by one party. This leaves our elections up to a handful of swing states. I want to chime in that the electoral college is better thought of as the mechanism for bringing the 3/5ths compromise to the presidential level. Without it the white male voters from the north would have dominated white male voters from the south. People underestimate how much of the souths population was enslaved Africans. South Carolina for example wasnt majority white until the 1920s. Without the electoral college, the white south would not have been able to vote for the black south."
27140148629,"It makes me happy just to see the conversation happening. I dont think itll happen too soon, but the fact that were talking about it is a nice sign of progress."
27140155133,"Yeah, its still gonna be a shit system until we get money out of politics. If the first requirement to be electable is to have a shit-ton of money for the campaign, then this isnt a democracy. We cant get to vote on the people we want. Instead, were forced to pick between the 2 richest guys. [These people](http://www.wolf-pac.com) are working to solve the problem. Join the movement if you wanna get your democracy back."
27140163714,What will be the effects of this in a money dominated system like ours? Will more private interests try to get involved in the Ferguson-investor coalition model of electoral politics or will citizens have more say?
27140187750,"While I dont support the electoral college as I dont believe my vote has realistically counted yet, there are some problems with getting rid of it as well. Lets talk voter education, specifically about the issues and the candidates themselves. In a perfect world everyone would have a vote and each would influence the election directly. Thats awesome until you remember how the majority of the voters would decide. Today the few who decide get bombarded with ads, visits and media coverage. Without the electorate college those visits and ads would be spread out across the nation (good thing) and more people would receive less direct contact with the candidates (good-ish). The rest of the campaign tactics lies directly in gaming the media to a significantly larger scale than today. A large portion of voters are really only accessible via the media. My only hope would be that candidates use the internet to voice issues instead of slinging mud at each other. I still support getting rid of the electoral college but I dont know really how an election would play out. We only know what the results would have done and even then the rules were different so that doesnt really work as a model."

27140209967,"The President (with their VP) is the one nationally elected politician in this country - its obvious that it should be by a popular vote for a number of reasons. Approval_Voting laid out some great ones but here are some extras I didnt see in his comment: (1) people who are in very red or very blue states essentially feel like their vote is worthless because their states electoral college votes are a done deal before the voting even starts. (2) I do think its a problem that small population states get more electoral votes per voter, its simply unfair. why should someones vote in Montana count more than someones vote in California? small states already have over-representation in the Senate, they shouldnt get extra weight for their presidential votes as well. "

27140225626,Yes. Because this is why everything is fucked up... :/
27140233722,"Since no one is commenting on the benefits the EC has I will list some. The big one is that it insulates voter fraud from the rest of the election. Imagine you are a republican governor in north dakota, you know your state is going to vote overwhelmingly in favor of republican president with EC there is nothing you can do to influence this election. In national popular vote you can suppress the democratic vote in your state, you can destroy democrats ballots, you have more incentive to disenfranchise them etc. In the current system you dont give a shit because their vote does not matter for the big elections but for those people their vote still matters for local politics so the EC system is better for them. The EC system means that every state has some individual relevance to the presidential election without it the candidates are just campaigning on national issues and not caring about local issues effecting each state. They wont care that southern gulf states need hurricane relief, northern states need factory jobs, etc. They will campaign purely on national issues, though their campaign will spread to all states it will be less focused. At least now they help out in the swing states in the national popular vote they not bring any attention or relief to local issues. Presidential campaigns are mostly pointless you know how the candidates stands either you want vote for him or not, at least when they visit the small communities in swing states they help out with their campaign efforts, if they only visit major city centers they wont help out anything. The small town farmer will have much less influence and never see the candidate because it is better for them to visit only city centers where they can talk to the most people. In the EC system every last vote counts in the swing states which means they must talk to local farmers and rural residents which is representative of farmers across the country not just the swing states. In national popular vote they will never bother to visit farmers or address their issues because there is no need to get their vote"
27140236589,The electoral college needs a lot of reform but this will just lead to nominees campaigning/focusing in large population centers. The original idea of the electoral votes was to prevent this tyranny of the majority and spread the focus of the nations politicians. Its failing in that regard but there are likely ways of remedying it instead of getting rid of the entire concept. 
27140237359,I didnt even know this was a thing. Which other states are in this? Whats the likelihood of the Electoral college really going away?

27140286159,"Its a damn shame that we cant simply do away with all this proxy shit in the first place and just create some kind of app that would let people vote directly on everything. I mean, its definitely possible in a technological sense, but this is America - home of the electronic voting machines that mysteriously seem to always screw up in a way that changes every vote to a Republican candidate."
27140288807,"But for the electoral college wed have had President Gore instead of Cowboy W. The world would be healthier, safer and happier today if that had happened. That said, the top comment as of this moment states, accurately I think: removing the electoral college would actually increase the number of cities and states where candidates have to campaign. This worries me some, because that broad a campaign requires a boatload of money and I therefore think it tilts toward the candidate better able to land big donors. That tends to be Rs. "
27140316819," My Poli Sci class said the electoral college was established because there was no national system to tabulate votes. The votes were counted locally and a representative was sent to Washington to tell them what the vote was. It makes sense, since it was a 2 week ride to Washington for some states representatives."
27140319206,"Some states are strongly red and some states are strongly blue, because they are seeing different campaign ads. Without the electoral college, we would all get to see the same ads. Maybe wed understand each other better."
27140320255,"For now we need to do the following: * Get rid of the Electoral College * Move to a better voting system, like the Alternative Vote (its not perfect, but its the best suggestion Ive seen so far) * Work with gerrymandering to make it more fair or make gerrymandering impossible some how."
27140332370,"Yes to this! Most votes in the US dont even count unless youre in a major city. This is why I done even bother to vote anymore. For example, to win Minnesotas 10 electoral votes, all a candidate has to pretty much do is win Hennepin County. The folks in the outlying areas are pretty much ignored. "
27140347614,"The first question I ask whenever something is being changed is this: what is the worst way this could be exploited by someone trying to game the system? Ask that, because sooner or later it will happen. Is there a way for more conservative states to manipulate this since it seems to be more Democratic/battleground states signing up for this and not Republican ones? One thing I do foresee: instead of shenanigans in mostly just swing states like Florida and Ohio, youll see election shenanigans across the country in hundreds of different districts as corrupt local officials try to give their side an edge in the overall vote. Voter suppression efforts are going to go through the roof."

27140494711,"Whats interesting is that depending on how minority turnout is post-Obama this could actually help Republicans at the expense of Democrats. The entire Republican plan right now is to motivate white voters who already trending towards the GOP anyway. However, its looking like they are really only succeeding in states that already vote Republican anyway in the South and rural West. Again this depends on future minority turnout, but it is at least *plausible* that they could win the popular vote but lose the electoral college because Democrats are making gains in every swing state."

Of course, this assumes that conservatives/Republicans see a large portion of the populace not having health insurance as a real problem.

All in all, its a great idea as it takes a lot of hand-holding out. Yes, people are pissed because they have to pay more (I cant tell you the number of people that Ive argued with that, quite literally, said that they would much rather spend the money on themselves than on healthcare, leaving everyone else to catch their bills), but responsibility is something that all of America has been particularly low on. Also, presuming the fuckhead doesnt pussyfoot around, this is a fantastic first step towards the system that every other developed country uses...you know, socialized healthcare. "
26841129695,"Chuck Grassley also put it in the bill. The democratic house actually said they would vote against any bill with a mandate. Then the house was put on the spot, either pass the bill with the mandate which made it out of the senate or get nothing passed. But they did pass a reconciliation bill in tandem with the senate bill. The reconciliation bill removed all criminals and civil penalties from not paying the health care tax if you dont have insurance. So while the IRS will garnish any return you are getting to pay the tax, they cant take you to court, try to charge you with a crime, or force you to pay any other way. Just keep in mind, the IRS will track what is owed and any time you are supposed to get a return, they will take it. You can therefore avoid this tax if you adjust your paycheck withholdings so you either get no return back at the end of the year, or slightly owe money."

26840705908,"I love how weve come to the point where all outrage at the individual mandate, [including Obamas](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/27/barack-obama/force-yes-but-she-wants-it-affordable/), has been shown to be phony populism. At heart, everyone understands that the mandate is necessary to have universal coverage in a non-single payer system. But its just so easy to rage against at anti-freedom in order to win an election. Obama [opposed it when running for president](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/opinion/30krugman.html), then quickly [adopted it once in office](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/03/the-mandate-memo-how-obama-changed-his-mind.html) because it was a necessary component of health care reform. Romney instituted the individual mandate when he was Governor of Massachusetts because all of his advisors told him he needed to to make health care reform work, but then Romney opposed the mandate when running for president. The end result is that good, sound policy is opposed by the majority of the public because politicians on both sides on the aisle have opportunistically attacked it to gain an electoral advantage. "
26840647922,"In the end though who supports it doesnt make it a good or bad idea. Some Democrats and some Republicans might also change positions on mass wiretaps by the NSA based on who is in office, but that doesnt make the policies any better or worse. The problem with the individual mandate is that it becomes one more burden for the freelancers and self-employed, and thus it chains people to corporate jobs. This sort of program benefits the moneyed interests because it reduces competition, and turns owning a small business into the privilege of the independently wealthy. The individual mandate is thus a contributor (along with programs like Medicaid) to a sort of wage slavery that has taken over our country. The real problem in my view is that real health care reform is impossible unless we accept that Medicaid and Medicare cannot continue in their current form. If we spent as much on medical care per capita as Canada does, these two programs, with no further funding, would cover almost all Americans. But if one says that Medicare is a part of the problem, the political discussion gets shut down. In my mind there are only two acceptable solutions, from where I sit. The first would be a series of pro-market reforms aimed at better price transparency, quotes before non-emergency care, etc. Lets have medical guilds, and compulsatory licensing for patents in medicine. For all the talk of free market forces by Republicans none of these options are ever on the table. They push monopolistic reforms which will surely raise prices (as will the inability to say no to a bad insurance deal under the PPACA). But the second would be a distributed, localist single payer system along the Canadian model. In Canada, the provinces each have their own systems and the federal requirements are so lax that every province well exceeds them (this is important because it increases bargaining power by the provinces regarding costs). Keep the decision making local and the decisions about coverage local. But for all their talk about universal health care, there is no way that any Democratic lawmaker will be willing to endorse reforms that hand Medicare to the states. Our system is doomed because both parties want to use the health care crisis to ensure that the middle class is a working class, incapable of owning small businesses."

This is absolutely and completely false. The real work of the law is being done by a ton of moving pieces, including IPAB and the Medicare expansion. Possible Meaning 2: The law would fall to pieces without the mandate. This is true. Theres basically no way to cover pre-existing conditions without it."

26840752700,"The individual mandate is great for insurance companies. Otherwise, it fucking sucks. Obama promised a health care bill during his 2008 campaign.

He put form over substance, for the sake of keeping a campaign promise."

26840757299,but nobody supported the idea of passing massive legislation without reading it... this author needs to give me gum gum
26840758342,Both parties are bad and many people see this as my team vs yours. This is no different than all the anti-war left who disappeared when Obama was elected.
26840761128,Who gives a shit if it was their idea over two decades ago the way Obamacare is being implemented with said individual mandate is garbage. 
26840763184,Their plan was a mandate for individuals to have catastrophic coverage to replace Medicaid and Medicare and not be employer based. We could only wish Obamacare was like that. Think of how a smoking hot our economy would be and how many lives would be saved.
26840764462,At least a few of them might have been able to support the individual mandate if we hadnt had to pass the bill before we knew what was in it. Democrats screwed the pooch with the sloppy way they passed the ACA and set the stage for the opposition against it the day they passed it without any Republican support.
26840764583,"Not sure why it matters who supported what in the past. The fact of the matter is, we have this type of healthcare in place, i see few benefits and many problems, what are we going to do to make it better. That should be the focus of the conversation. Not R versus D which is the cause of this mess in the first place."
26840768149,but dont you understand the difference? the president of the united states is black!
26840779217,"To be fair, supporting something 25 years ago does not mean they should support it later. Finding out new information and changing ones mind is not necessarily intellectual honesty. It *could* be, but it could also be critical examination given the information at hand. This being politics I doubt its entirely the latter, but its rather unfair to say you supported this decades ago you should support it now is nearly that simple. Democrats supported Jim Crow laws when they were passed. Should they support them now or was there a platform shift and they thought hey this might not be a good idea?"
26840788719,"Yes, the worst part of the Affordable Care act was originally a Republican idea. Anyone whos been paying attention already knows this, and even if this is news to you I have no idea why anyone would be surprised about this."
26840791186,Obamacare by itself will bring this country crashing down into financial ruin. If fully implemented I give us 5 years before true financial disaster strikes.

26840811293,Who cares? How is this significant to the current police state and a president who just doesnt give a fuck? 
26840814020,look like the conservatives win big. SUCK IT LIBERALS
26840814436,If I recall properly their mandate was that people be responsible for their medical bills and not have them written off. Not compulsory purchase of insurance at levels they may not need. Please correct me if I am wrong as my knowledge of this is all second hand due to being fresh out of the womb at the time Rs were proposing such things
26840833492,I found it funny to see conservatives back away from it after Romney did it (at the state level anyway). I guess because its arguably unconstitutional it was good fodder during an election. I find it funny to see liberals like it because its going burden the poor the most. The middleclass and the rich already have insurance. I support the individual mandate myself.
26840835055,"They didnt, to be fair, support the exact bill. "
26840841497,Which is the real reason it worries me. 
26840841885,Not quite 100 percent true. What was pushed in the past was a set of incentives to get everyone to be insured. More of a carrot approach than a tick approach. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-02-03/health-individual-mandate-reform-heritage/52951140/1 
26840848904,And it was a shit idea then too. The only reason its in the Affordable Care Act is because the Republicans wouldnt let us have a more common sense system like PAY YOUR TAXES and ADD EVERYONE TO MEDICARE.
26840859264,I love how the blame keeps on getting passed. Does it matter? Just get rid of it..
26840870669,"There is one fundamental flaw I have found with insurance. When insurance is involved the price of things seem to go way up. I am starting to believe this is due to fraud. In Ontario healthcare is covered but things like ambulance rides and semi-private to private room are not covered. However, if no other rooms are available at the hospitals then the semi and private rooms become free. On one occasion my wife was covered for a semi-private room but only a private room was available, the hospital charged her for a semi-private room (covered by insurance) and gave her a discount for the difference of the private room. This is clearly corruption. Thats the flaw with insurance it offers no incentive for the consumer to speak out against corruption. Things like health and car insurance are best done when offered by a monopoly like the government."
26840871107,"Wait, are you telling me politicians are behaving hypocritically for political reasons? This bit of hypocracy though was old news 4 years ago, why are we discussing it now?"
26840877047,1. Checkmate ~~athiests christians~~ republicans.
26840878443,Obama has near compete control over the Republican party. America just hasnt realized it yet and neither have the republicans.
26840879003, I prevented my doctors office from committing fraud this morning. I feel good. i will be emailing my doctor who was out of town. I would rather not report the office since I stopped it but there is a part of me that says I should. The office is own by IHA so that is a big company. 
26840905341,"I dont think Republicans realize that their argument that it was a counter to ___ (i.e. Hillarycare) actually hurts their overall position. What they are saying is, we didnt actually have any plan to do anything about health care. They made us come up with something, you cant hold it against us."
26840923270,"I like it when liberals start getting desperate.... And one more time for the record, Republican != conservative. Nice try though."
26840938579,YAY MOTHER JONES!!!! YAY OBAMA! 
26840960853,"Umm, anyone read how a bunch of doctors nationwide have dropped both private insurance companies and government plans, and cut their costs by half???"
26841008037,"I love this article, because Ive been saying this for five fucking years."
26841015991,Obama was elected with a healthcare mandate and ended up passing a healthcare bill that was more right wing than the status quo as it expanded the role of private insurance. Universal Healthcare was inevitable and Obama pushed it back by decades.
26841022038,Are people not allowed to change their opinion anymore? If I made a decision in the 90s should I be expected to follow that line of thinking literally the rest of my life? 
26841023570,Haha mother jones 
26841060603,"What kills me here is the key difference between the heritage foundations mandate and obamas. The heritage mandate would work like auto insurance, it does not matter who you are insured with, as long as your are insured. This was proposed to counter plans that were being pushed by democrats, namely Hillary Clinton which was then later proposed and voted on in 93. This is unlike Obamas mandate which is that if you are not insured through obamacare, you will be fined. You have to pay a fine whether you are insured or not, as long as you dont obamacare you would have to pay a fine. The difference in the two mandates is that the heritage foundation forces you into free market healthcare and Obamas forces you into government healthcare. That being said I disagree with both so dont take this as Im taking sides. "
26841065350,We force drivers to have auto insurance. Why are Republicans never enraged about that?
26841084339,"The differences between Romneycare and Obamacare: 1. Romneycare aimed to insure everyone in Massachusetts, Obamacare aims to take over and regulate the insurance industry. 2. Romneycare is enforced by MassHealth, Obamacare is enforced by the IRS (which was recently busted for targeting conservative groups.) 3. Romneycare had bipartisan support, Obamacare didnt. 4. Romneycare was funded, Obamacare is not. 5. Romneycares constitutionality was upheld in court, Obamacare was ruled unconstitutional 2X. 6. Dont like Romneycare? Try another state.

26937619548,"&gt;I thought Clinton managed a surplus? On paper, yes. We didnt actually have a surplus, though, because the national debt continued to grow. &gt;Paid for with borrowed money, Sanders point exactly. I am sure you understood that as well. I can say the same thing for lots of government programs, though. &gt;Chances are Sanders knows more about it than you and me. And thats why I didnt comment on it. &gt;Reality is that after the tax breaks rich people had more and the government less money. Again you fail to grasp Sanders argument. Dude, federal revenues went up after the Bush tax cuts. Stop ignoring this."

We arent paying the contractors helping manufacture the equipment used to make war? People are getting paid. The wars ARE being paid for. Seriously? The govt has been borrowing an unprecedented amount of money to pay for the wars. They now have to pay that money back somehow, eventually. Hence, the wars are considered unpaid for. I dont understand whats so difficult to grasp about the concept. &gt; Tax breaks dont go to citizens. Tax breaks allow citizens to keep more of their money from the government. And, yes, the rich, seeing as they pay far more in taxes, get to keep far more of their money. All money doesnt automatically belong to the government. Look, I know that nobody likes paying taxes, least of all the rich. Thats a pretty solid part of the reason theyre so rich anyways. However, theres tax, and theres legalised tax evasion: when a CEO of a major company turns around and says that they pay less actual real dollars in tax than their secretary who makes a fraction of his salary, your tax system is broken. Stop trying to defend it. "
26937637849,"&gt;Dude, federal revenues went up after the Bush tax cuts. Stop ignoring this. CBO, Nov. 14, 2001: Individual income tax receipts fell by $10 billion, or 1.0 percent, in fiscal year 2001. Those receipts would have increased by roughly 3 percent without the $35 billion in tax rebates and smaller reductions from other tax cuts. In fact, total federal revenues declined in fiscal year 2001 for the first time since 1983, mainly because of the Bush tax cuts. The CBO said total revenues declined by 1.7 percent, but otherwise would have increased by 1.5 percent. [source](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/07/sessions-wrong-on-bush-tax-cuts/)"

26937641879,"As many have said, most of your statements are false. Since everyone else just rebuffed them, I will provide sources. &gt; Weve had a budget deficit since 1835. False. Clinton ran a surplus for 3 years which Bush inherited. And under that plan would have the entire debt paid off within a few decades. Source: http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/ Maybe youre referring to the federal debt? &gt; Unpaid? This is a matter of semantics, but generally if you have to increase your liabilities to pay for a good, that good is considered to be unpaid until the liability is settled. Sure the provider of the good receives money for it and thus gets paid, you are still balance sheet negative. For instance, if you buy a new car and take out a loan to pay for it, the dealer still gets the money for the car, but you dont get the title for it until its paid off. This makes it difficult to say you have paid for your car until you pay back the loan. Source: basic household finance &gt; I honestly dont know anything about Medicare Part D and, chances are, neither do you. Moving on... Quick education for you: medicare part d was a large prescription drug benefit expansion of medicare.

More info: http://www.factcheck.org/2011/08/more-mediscare/ &gt; Did you guys know that, after the Bush tax cuts, federal revenues actually went up? Also false.

26937762261,"Actually, you CAN blame deficits on tax cuts, because less tax revenue will ALWAYS increase debt for a given level of spending. The supposedly fiscally conservative Republicans massively increased the deficit during Dubyas presidency. Medicare part D is the prescription drug benefit that Dubya pushed for, and it is completely unfunded. I wish we had a balanced budged amendment just so Republicans couldnt pull this shit."

26937735296,"&gt;False. Clinton ran a surplus for 3 years which Bush inherited. And under that plan would have the entire debt paid off within a few decades. And, yet, under the surplus of the Republican Congress, the national debt - year to year - never went down, did it? How do you have a surplus without the debt going down? &gt;This is a matter of semantics, but generally if you have to increase your liabilities to pay for a good, that good is considered to be unpaid until the liability is settled. True, but you can classify many government programs, under this definition, as unpaid for. Its just easy to single out the military. &gt;Also false. Its easier to just link to the gross federal receipts for the years before and after the tax cuts were implemented. The bush tax cuts were implemented in 2001 so watch what happened to 2001 and 2002 revenues. There were TWO rounds of Bush tax cuts.

26826311924,"You know, eventually prices will drop because nobody is working full time anymore and so nobodys making enough to buy anything. This has to balance out at a point. Its already starting to happen with rents where I live (Vancouver). In the meantime it means that a lot of people have a lot of extra time. Thats tons of time to read, create, volunteer, protest, and generally improve ourselves and the world. That, and play video games, of course. I work half-time and I love it. Dont take me the wrong way, though. If I wasnt making a livable wage, Id be seriously depressed and pissed off. "
26826769994,"Hours-per-week just creates a threshold for employers to limbo under. Make the cutoff 20 and every employee gets scheduled 19.

26826366632,"After the new laws that govern health care for employees working 30 hours there is absolutely nobody right now hiring full time workers unless youve already got an established career path going. Like if youre in college or out of high school there are no full time jobs. Most jobs are maybe 20-29 hours max. And that 29 is the absolute tippy top, so just to be safe theyll keep you at 25 or 26 a week. It really fucks me over personally because here I am, three years IT experience, ive had my hands in all sorts of stuff and I had people offering me 8.75 at 20 hours and acting like they were being generous. Its really weird out here because sometimes youll get an outlier position that says Hey well only give you 20 hours but well do 20 bucks an hour as part of our college internship program. and those jobs go faster than tickets at comic con.

26826141999,Hello! Im a bot who mirrors websites if they go down due to being posted on reddit. [Here is a screenshot of the website](http://i.imgur.com/lhaxxLM.jpg). *Please feel free to PM me your comments/suggestions/hatemail.*
26826339616,"I am curious as to who is to blame here. It seems like this is a culmination of numerous factors that were either ignored or downplayed in significance. Most notably, Im sure no one could have predicted how quickly technological advancements made it possible for machines/robots to replace human labor. I could be wrong about that, but it seems this trend has exponentially grown at a rate that would be difficult to keep up. The rise of the information and big data age means that fewer jobs are on the market because just a few BIG players can trickle down information by collecting (for free I might add) it from the masses. Think Google, Amazon, etc. They are in the business of big data, largely on the backs of individuals who are not compensated for what they input. This is tricky, because consumers love the ability to use services for free or low cost, without realizing that they are sucking dry jobs essential to them. We must change our economy to represent this shift if we hope to maintain a middle-class. A lot of this is explained in a great book by Jaron Lanier in [Who Owns The Future.](http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Future-Jaron-Lanier/dp/1451654960) "

26825995332,This cant be surprising. They knew when they implemented the 30-hour rule in Obamacare without any kind of teeth preventing companies from artificially keeping employee hours under the mark that this was going to happen. I just hope that it wasnt intentional on the part of the administration for jobs numbers... Best way to fix this is to give that portion of Obamacare teeth.

I think were starting to see a part-time ramp up to meet increased demand in some sectors, and if it keeps up some of those may get converted to full time, though god knows the people who will have to pay them more and also now give them healthcare coverage will fight it tooth and nail."

26826143058,In President Obamas America there are super rich big government Democrats like Hillary and Barack and Harry Reid setting punishing policy for the disregarded masses. The ruling elites know best whats good for their subjects and part time labor keeps the little people voting hoping for handouts.

26826308221,This is my shocked face. :O Are you saying that since Full time workers became significantly more expensive due to health care costs people have stopped creating jobs for them?

26826372809,"You know, in general, when an economy is starting to recover, the first thing most employers do when demand goes up is hire either part-time workers or temp workers. They have more demand so they need more workers, but they arent confident enough yet to make the commitment necessary to hire people full-time. Generally speaking, most economists consider an increase in part-time workers, temp workers, and overtime work to be a leading indicator that implies that the number of full-time workers will be increasing soon.

27152230545,"This GOP lawmaker has convinced me of nothing. I have been following this debate for several years and the overwhelming evidence supporting the idea that women are not paid less for the same work convinced me. The shell game is the one constantly harped on by the sexists. They constantly conflate getting paid less for the same work and getting paid less for different work and expect people to not understand the difference. The simple fact of the matter is that if someone makes choices which cause them to make less money(not getting a degree, not being a world class athlete etc.) then they should get paid less if that is something that is relevant to their job. Women take more time off of work, they work less dangerous jobs, they leave the workforce more often, they get lowerpaying degrees, the negotiate less, they go into lower paying jobs, they commute less and they work more flexible hours. All these things among many others contribute to the pay gap. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-women-are-paid-77-cents-dolla/ http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-women-make-77-cents-/"
27152162462,"Again --- shell game. Equal pay is about equal pay for the SAME WORK. Women get paid less for the SAME WORK. Not entering a field commonly populated by men is not at issue here. Youre suggesting that because women dont become construction workers (for example) then they should be paid less as marketing execs, as call center employees, as clerical staff etc. We men make different choices in life too. A person rarely fits into the he-man stereotype he is brought up into and told to be. Should we then pay muscular people more then computer nerds because of the choices they made. Should fat people be paid less? Should old people? How about the nearsighted? Bad drivers? Those who drink? Where does it end? Simply put, while this GOP lawmaker has apparently successfully convinced you the pay gap is because women just dont want to work at jobs that are designed from inception for men, because women were never part of the workforce when they were created, the real battle that MOST women are fighting is the ability to be paid an EQUAL amount for EQUAL amount of work. The attempt to derail the conversation by bringing up female laziness, and then blaming the gap ON THEM is ridiculous and completely transparent. Speaking of transparency, most equal pay advocate measures simply wish to empower all employees to see what their counterparts take home so that things like discrimination based on gender (along with a whole host of other issues) could be brought to light. I think its pretty obvious why this is so strongly apposed, but as someone who once worked in a payroll department I can tell you too many people are being taken advantage of by their employer. Too many people are getting paid WAY below their counterparts simply because this transparency doesnt exist. In fact, Im quite certain, had their been women who worked at the grate company I worked for, I probably would have found they were underpaid more then any other group. By law we arent supposed to discriminate with pay or when hiring, and too many employees are doing just that. "

The mainstream media acted as a cheerleader for Obama/Clinton and cut off/ignored most of what Gravel and Kucinich had to say. Of course this will be downvoted to hell, but I remember the mood around the election very well. The media basically picked the Democratic candidates for us, and they shut down the others by not letting them speak at the debates/slandering their positions. "

I disagree. I think what they did is consistent with what Obama has always said: no searches without a warrant. This, despite Politifacts, claim has not changed. "

Are you going to believe Hillary when she tells you that what we need is a big change and she is here to deliver? Or Biden or Cuomo? Ok, you probably wont believe Hillary, but shes better than Chris Christie or that cuban guy, right? So its an emotional issue. Or what if Al Gore steps in as the savior of the day? Are you going to believe him when he tells you his job creation plan goes hand in hand with his plan to save us all from the imminent destruction presented by melting glaciers? How many of you are going to remember the let down you are currently experiencing when it comes time to make this decision again? How many of you are going to let yourselves be lead back into the bipartisan dichotomy where you feel compelled to vote against the candidate you are more scared of, rather than standing up and being a real participating member of a democracy?"
26765809319,"I wouldnt say that his campaign was a scam. I think hes been a moderately good president. There was wiretapping during Clinton, the suspension of Habeus Corpus during Lincoln, and the Alien and Seditions Act under John Adams.

The US is a signor of the [Single Convention on Narcotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs#Schedule_I). This international treaty lists schedules for all narcotics that all signors agree to uphold. Marijuana is listed as schedule I though in this treaty schedule I is not as strict as the US definition of schedule I. In the treaty schedule I means restricted to medical use only, absolutely forbid from purchase without a prescription. Other schedule I drugs in the treaty are things like morphine, heroin, oxycodin, etc. In order to remove marijuana from schedule in the US, ie allow full recreational sale, the US would need to abrogate the treaty which can only be done by a vote in congress or the treaty allows for drugs to be rescheduled upon WHO recommendations which i doubt will happen. If Obama removes marijuana from schedule and allows recreational sale he is in violation of an international treaty that was approved by congress which is an impeachable offense.

Democrats traditionally ignore these elections; but with legalization on the table in many states, many people will come out to vote that would otherwise stay home. "
27089219479,"&gt; Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order. the problem with doing this is that the next president can come in and make an executive order to reschedule it. so, lets say obama deschedules it by the end of 2014. suddenly medical dispensaries are opening up everywhere. then, the new president comes in 2017 and reverses what he did w/ an executive order. now its a rather sticky situation. obama wants congress to act on it. that way, if it wants to get changed again, it has to go through congress again. basically, it doesnt mean much if he removes it from schedule 1."
27089607835,Which could be undone just as easily. Executive orders only hold as long as that President is in office. Past that any president could override it with another order. However its harder to override Congress and not have all sorts of shit raised. 
27090249328,"But that doesnt fix the long term issue. If congress doesnt move it off a schedule 1 substance, the problem isnt fixed. "
27090011285,"Given the growing trend towards decriminalization and legalization in many states, I think hes waiting for the problem to fix itself. Same with gay marriage."
27089830029,"In one fell swoop, you killed the Obama cant do that argument."
27089883662,Im curious which article of the Constitution allows the President to nullify a law.
27089887982,Executive orders arent the end all be all of law making you know. And no he cant just sign an executive order legalizing marijuana. An executive order does not have that authority.
27089885935,Yeah. No one would call him a dictator. No one.
27089958414,"&gt;Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order. Thats entirely within his authority. To 100% legalize and regulate, yes, he would need Congress. But dont act as if the President is without any options in regard to marijuana policy. That would be incredibly inaccurate. If you really think its that easy, you shouldnt be posting on r/politics because you dont seem to know anything about politics. TECHNICALLY, he can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance... the same way that TECHNICALLY he could have put every soldier in Iraq on a boat and take them home on his first day in office. TECHNICALLY, he has that authority. In real life however, things are a lot different. Every president is constantly walking a tight-rope, trying to appease their party, appease the rival parties, appease congress, appease the american people, appease his cabinet, appease the judges... It just isnt nearly as easy as reddit makes it seem to just go bam, marijuana is not schedule 1 and it isnt a procedural issue, its political. Obama knows damn well that if he took marijuana off schedule 1 right now, when the nation is still pretty close to polarized on the subject, it could cause a political backlash that could hurt his presidency and hurt the chances of any democrat looking to run this year. Reading reddit every day it can be easy to forget that just about half the country finds your view on marijuana to be completely insane. They may be wrong scientifically speaking, but politics was never about being correct."
27089974814,"Right but do you understand the backlash he will get for this? mainly from the Republican party? They will vilify him even though it is something that SHOULD BE DONE, they will turn it to say he is attacking American morals, and thus try to block it every chance they can get."
27089976006,He can also pardon every person currently in jail for a non-violent marijuana charge. It would be awesome if he did that. 
27089894718,"No he can not. This lie gets repeated time and again on reddit, but the law does not work this way. You can petition, but then it goes into a lengthy review process, and I mean lengthy. Often a decade or more, theres one sitting in review right now. Obama doesnt have a rubber stamp that says reschedule. Its not even his job to review -- [in a multi-agency process.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_cannabis_from_Schedule_I_of_the_Controlled_Substances_Act#Process) Its clearly something congress has made as complicated as possible. "
27089960400,"&gt; Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order. No. He cant. The FDA can reschedule the drug, with the approval of the DEA. Obama can threaten to fire everyone in both departments if they fail to reschedule it. But then he might as well show up in the House with impeachment resolutions pre-filed."
27090046541,"Technically he can, but practically he cant because it would make certain powerful people upset. Thats why its called politics."
27089937109,"&gt;Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order Its strange to me the number of comments which are taking this statement as true by fiat, and responding with reasons why the President would prefer not to do that, rather than demanding that you provide some citation for the authority to override Congress express will on the issue. And before you say the DEA could therefore the President can please remember that delegation of legislative authority to an executive agency is *not* delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch. Ill wait."
27089698800,"&gt; Obama can remove marijuana as a schedule 1 substance by executive order. Thats entirely within his authority. No, it isnt. Nothing that is part of the convention of psychotropic drugs treaty can be rescheduled. The right of the AG to re-schedule is not universal."

27156008347,"From the Reddit hivemind, ya, I guess so. Im responding to comments claiming that Obamas 45% Promise Kept rating means that he was lying 65% of the time. Compromise on an issue? Well, that just means that youre a liar. Congress stall your efforts to keep your promise? Well, that also just means that youre a liar."
27156221216,"Yeah, this list rates Gitmo as stalled, because theres some intangible negotiating going on, allegedly because its no his fault that he cant close it, but Congress. If he would want it closed, he could close it. So much for this list. Edit: Stalled instead of promise kept, which is essentially: Gitmo remains open."

27155809425,"In regards to the internet though, hes a complete liar. Even in his AMA, which was likely a member of his staff, he claims to support an open internet. Why the hell was he trying to resurrect pieces of SOPA then? He was on board with ACTA too. Congress didnt force him to endorse those proposals. Has Congress been a hindrance for some things? Definitely. Have they been enough of a hindrance to justify using them as a scapegoat for him being a shitty President? No. "

27156625081,"I never said that *all* of his promises would have been kept with a more cooperative Congress, but certainly more of them would have. I only posted the link to dispute the idea (advanced by the person I was responding to) that the list of Obamas kept promises would be short. Its not."

27155648004,"And [here](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/) is that list. Youll notice that hes kept twice as many promises as hes broken. Its unfortunate that promises have been broken, but given that hes dealing with literally the most [ineffective](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/11/news/la-pn-congress-few-laws-2013-20131211) Congress in the history of the chamber, Im actually amazed that hes been able to accomplish as much as he has. EDIT: And now I have been given Reddit gold for a post where it feels like dissenters of my position outnumber supports 10 to 1. Maybe there is a silent majority out there after all. Well, thank you anonymous sir or madam, whoever you are. I shall go forth with vigor."
27155817734,Thanks for fighting the good fight Aukla. I dont subscribe to the Obama hate bandwagon. The problem was the tea party movement and republicans in congress. 
27155887749,"[Heres](http://www.radiolab.org/story/60-words/) an incredible radiolab on how our current war(s) started and how they are not likely to end, event though theyve officially ended. "

He wanted to close Gitmo, he tried to close Gitmo, and he would still like to close Gitmo. A backpedal would be if he had changed his mind. He hasnt. Maybe he should have been more specific during his campaign and claimed, I will close Gitmo... as long as Congress lets me. Anyway, Im amazed that Reddit keeps bringing this up like its Obamas fault. Hey Reddit, put more Progressive candidates in office and Gitmo will be closed. &gt; and increase transparency Transparency has been increased, just probably not as much as you would like. Still, I doubt that you can name a more transparent administration and detail why and how they were more transparent."
27155839802,"Interesting how you dont include compromise, and that list treats all promises as equal in value."
27155864889,"Its unrealistic and borderline insane to presume that any one person can have the responsibility to govern the worlds most powerful conglomerate of 300+ million people. That being said, as elected president you ARE going to be the primary party held responsible for things. Side: why is there never conversation amongst the people about changing congress. The democratic government is beholden to its people and what is the peoples rating of congress? It can nearly be rounded to 0% approval. "
27155896124,You keep saying transparent. I do not think it means what you think it means.

27155821481,The Iraq war is over because we were forced out of the country by the new Iraqi leader.... nice spin though
27155836974,This administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers than any other in history. How is that transparent?
27155827758,Once again criticizing without providing any real argument or evidence. The echo chamber that you live in is equally old.
27155664939,"Youre right to point out the reality of the situation, but for a lot of us that initially supported Obama, its not the *number* of promises that have been broken, its *which* promises were broken. Its completely unfair to expect the president to accomplish every single platform promise he comes in on, but when the biggest lines of your campaign are end wars, close Gitmo, and increase transparency, and then you backpedal on every single one of those issues..."
27156284443,Good guy Obama. Only keeps 2/3 of his promises.
27155857447,"The problem also seems to be that rather than look at his history and policies and accepting that hes a fairly typical politician with average center-right policies. A guy that has a nice mix of policies to try and satisfy/appeal to the broadest possible range of americans, while still maintaining the status quo and following the bureaucratic processes and politics of congress. Redditors ignored all that and instead took lowest common denominator slogans and marketing hype and constructed this really bizarre and unrealistic character that was going to give everyone free healthcare and create world peace and be a shining beacon of classical liberalism for the entire world, congress be damned, and now theyre disappointed that rainbows do not in fact shine out of Obamas ass and things are business as usual."
27155999525,All promises not marked as kept are thereby defaulted to not kept.

"
27155735769,"Ask for an honest argument, and I get a dishonest reply. Great. &gt; The Carter administration and the Church Committee. The Church committee occurred under Ford, not Carter, and given Fords pardon of Nixon, its hard to defend his transparency. As for Cater, if you want to talk about him being more transparent than Obama, youll have to do better than just writing his name. &gt; The Obama administration is less press friendly than Ws was and has prosecuted whistleblowers on a rate more than pretty much any other administration. So, are you arguing that Obamas administration is less transparent than the notoriously secretive Bush people? I understand that youre only making a singular claim, but its disturbing to me that I ask you to point to a more transparent administration than Obamas, and you cite George W. Bush."
27155881055,"Hey Reddit, put more Progressive candidates in office and Gitmo will be closed. Yeah thanks to the limber and effective system that brings you the choice of the same liar or Mitt fucking Romney every four years. Power to the people! "
27155972957,"I appreciate you calling me sir. Still though, this is a link, not an argument, and all the link says is that the government is not being as transparent as reporters would like, but it doesnt compare this administration to past administrations, which would be a useful thing to do since my claim is that transparency has increased under Obama when compared to how it was under, say, Bush."
27155891664,&gt;he would still like to close Gitmo. He can let everyone out of Gitmo right now with a phone call.
27155794384,Ah theres the apologists. I almost forgot I was in r/politics until you showed up. 
27155832279,"Congressional obstruction is not the same as lying. Lying would be if Obama secretly wanted to keep Gitmo open, campaigned on closing it, then revealed his true preference once elected. Obamas opinion and desires on many of these issues havent changed, but the realities of working in a divided government have. Unfortunately, Politifact didnt exist before Obama, so there is no way to chronicle the past promises of presidents and see how Obama compares to them. It will be interesting though to see how the next president compares to him."

27155829871,"We were forced out eh? Ya, that all powerful Iraq leader. Im sure when we saw him Obama said, Holy shit, we have to get out 700 billion dollar a year military out of Iraq before they decimate us!

27155990511,"&gt; He wanted to close Gitmo, he tried to close Gitmo Obamas plan to close Gitmo was to simply move the prisoners onto US soil, preserving the system of indefinite detention without trial.

I tell you what, Im not going to go through the whole thing because thats been done in other threads, but I will rebut the first five items, just to show how stupid this is: &gt; On December 31, 2011, Obama signed the NDAA (http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text), giving him the ability to indefinitely detain any U.S. civilian without charge or trial. And he just as quickly said that hes not going to indefinitely detain any U.S. civilian, and in fact hasnt indefinitely detained any U.S. civilian. And based on a series of Supreme Court cases during the Bush administration (Hamdi, Hamdan, and Boumediene), any attempt that he might make to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens would be stuck down by the court. &gt; Obama supports internet censorship/surveillance. He plans to issue an executive order this year that resembles CISPA if the bill is not passed. (http://rt.com/usa/news/white-house-cispa-order-821/) Oh, look, its been a year and nothing like that has happened. Actually, I wish Obama would try to censor morons like you who post factually incorrect garbage on the Internet, just so I dont feel like punching my computer monitor over and over again from having to read this crap. &gt; Despite his claims, Obama has killed thousands of people, including civilians and children, with drone strikes. Obama has never claimed otherwise. Although, its important to note that the drone program is limited to two places (rural Pakistan, and rural Yemen), and that in 2012 and 2013 the proportion of civilian deaths compared to militant deaths was about [2%](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/07/02/resources-and-graphs/). &gt; The president redefined the word militant to mean all military-age males in a strike zone. This allows him to refer to civilians killed in a drone strike as militants to avoid counting civilian deaths. (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;) Its true that this happened, which is why its a good thing that independent journalists (like the ones I cite above) have gone out of their way to calculate the true number of civilians killed compared to militants. That number, again, is about 2% for 2012 and 2013. &gt; President Barack Obama signed the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act of 2012 earlier this year allowing 30,000 drones to be used on U.S. soil by law enforcement, government agencies, corporations, etc. Again, this was a year and do any of you see drones flying over you with missile lock? That aside, if drones do enter the sky, it will likely be so that they can participate in [disaster relief](http://whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/23/drones-the-future-of-disaster-response/), not militant execution (which would be illegal anyway).

Still, I doubt that you can name a more transparent administration and detail why and how they were more transparent. Transparency has been increased by Edward Snowden. The obama administration is black book everything. Also obama promised no lobbyists in the whitehouse, so he just meets them across the street. Theyve also refused to allow access to registers that presidents have for years. "
27156106894,"Saying he ended those wars is disingenuous at best. Its been six years. That isnt ending a war, its finishing a war. Lets not pretend that his original promise was to continue fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan until the war was won, or that a McCain or even possibly a Romney presidency wouldnt have seen the end of the wars on a similar if not identical timetable. Plus Obama tried to start his own war in Syria, and is sounding more and more like he will intervene in Ukraine any day now. And while we are at it, lets address the fact that while Obama may have a shitty congress now, the Democrats had a supermajority for quite a while under Obama, and Gitmo wasnt closed. So clearly putting more progressives in office wont close Gitmo. "

As for your second comment, the Democrat super-majority was less than one year, and was only a super-majority if you counted Joe Lieberman (an independent) as a Democrat (he didnt often act like one). That aside, its certainly correct that many of those Democrats voted against closing Guantanamo, and they shouldnt have. Those Democrats and Obama have a difference of opinion on the issue, but my point is to say that if youre angry that Guantanamo is still open, you should direct your vitriol at Congress, not Obama.

But once Obama came in, he wasnt beholden to that plan or any other. Surely you remember that during the 2008 campaign, John McCain was for an extended U.S. military presence in Iraq, right? It was one of the chief points of division between the two candidates. Had McCain won, the U.S. would have stayed in Iraq. He didnt. Second, the U.S. troop presence that would have been extended past the pullout date would have only been one division, and even then would have only been temporary to cover exigencies. Lets not pretend that Obama was going to keep 150,000 troops in Iraq past the pullout date."

His Compromises and Broken Promises have mostly been since the Republicans regained control of the House in January, 2011. Its worth noting, however, that although Democrats had majorities in both chambers for two years, the Republicans were able to filibuster many Democratic initiatives, which prevented Obama from doing things like sign into law an even larger stimulus, a healthcare bill with a public option, or a cap and trade energy plan, among other things."

And leads to a bigger question, with Democrat Party members that could draw Indys like me out there, why support someone so flawed? http://freebeacon.com/the-hillary-papers/ THE SEX FILES On July 28, 1997, President Clinton was facing yet another wave of allegations from yet another woman. Kathleen Willey had accused Clinton of sexually assaulting her, and Blair faxed a Drudge Report item about her claims to one of the presidents aides. Blairs handwritten note attached to the story: Do we take Matt Drudge seriously? Six months later, Drudge would break the story of an affair between Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky, setting in motion the events that would lead to the presidents impeachment. Hillary Rodham Clinton When Clinton finally admitted to the relationship after repeated denials, Hillary Clinton defended her husband in a phone call with Blair. She said her husband had made a mistake by fooling around with the narcissistic loony toon Lewinsky, but was driven to it in part by his political adversaries, the loneliness of the presidency, and her own failures as a wife. She told Blair that the affair did not include sex within any real meaning of the term and noted President Clinton tried to manage Monica after they broke up but things spiraled beyond control. Blair described the contents of the Sept. 9, 1998, phone call in a journal entry. [Hillary] is not trying to excuse [Bill Clinton]; it was a huge personal lapse. And she is not taking responsibility for it, Blair wrote. But, she does say this to put his actions in context. Ever since he took office theyve been going thru personal tragedy ([the death of] Vince [Foster], her dad, his mom) and immediately all the ugly forces started making up hateful things about them, pounding on them. They adopted strategy, public strategy, of acting as tho it didnt bother them; had to. [Hillary] didnt realize toll it was taking on him, Blair continued. She thinks she was not smart enough, not sensitive enough, not free enough of her own concerns and struggles to realize the price he was paying. Hillary Clinton told Blair she had received a letter from a psychologist who does family therapy and sexual infidelity problems, who told the Yale Law School graduate, most men with fidelity problems [were] raised by two women and felt conflicted between them. The psychologist suggested that Bills infidelity had its roots in his childhood. Hed read about Bills bio; grandmother despised [Bills mother] Virginia, tried to get custody of Bill; Bill adored by his mother, but she left him, etc. etc. In her conversations with Blair, the first lady gave her husband credit for trying to end the affair with Lewinsky, and said he did not take advantage of his White House intern. It was a lapse, but she says to his credit he tried to break it off, tried to pull away, tried to manage someone who was clearly a narcissistic loony toon; but it was beyond control, wrote Blair. HRC insists, no matter what people say, it was gross inappropriate behavior but it was consensual (was not a power relationship) and was not sex within any real meaning (standup, liedown, oral, etc.) of the term. ALL THOSE WHINEY WOMEN Hillary Clintons blunt assessments were not confined to Monica Lewinsky. In a Dec. 3, 1993, diary entry, Blair recounted a conversation with the first lady about Packwooda reference to then-Sen. Bob Packwood, an influential Republican on health care embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal. HC tired of all those whiney women, and she needs him on health care, wrote Blair. I told her Id been bonding w. creeps; she said that was the story of her whole past year. Fabio incidentsweeping her up, sending her roses. Privately, the Clinton White House was acutely sensitive to public perceptions of President Clintons treatment of women. Supreme Court nominations were not immune from such considerations. In a three-page May 11, 1994, memo, Blair recounted her phone conversation with President Clinton about reservations he had about his preferred nominee to the high Court, the late Arkansas Judge Richard Arnold. Noting Clinton allies had really been trying to keep the womens groups in line since Paula Jones filing, Bill Clinton, according to Blairs account, was concerned feminist groups might blow sky high if he appointed Arnold to the Supreme Court. Arnold had ruled that the Jaycees club could bar women from full membershipa decision later overturned by the highest court in the land. Hillary Rodham Clinton The president was also concerned about accusations of infidelity in Arnolds divorce recordsallegations the president believed had the potential to reignite scrutiny of his own background. ¡°Stuff is in the [divorce] record¡ªapparently includes other people¡ªand no matter what Hatch says, this will come out, and will make it sound like the only friends [Bill] has in Arkansas are adulterers,¡± wrote Blair. ¡°This thing is so sick, according to ["

In September, the Medical Group Management Association -- a trade group for medical-practice executives -- surveyed 1,000 physician groups that collectively employ 47,500 doctors. &gt;The survey asked, among other things, Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange?

Except we are *here* and *now* with Obama, who has continued *and expanded* a lot of the same bullshit from the last administration. I think what sets him apart from Bush in this respect is that Obama *campaigned* on certain fundamental promises, the majority of which he has broken completely. So much has been written about W. Bush and his lies that its approaching becoming well accepted in the history books. Since Obama is still president, his history is still being written, and we need to hold him up to closer scrutiny than ever before. &gt;If they were looking to see why the initiatives Obama pushed for failed, perhaps they should take a look at Congress. Cant we blame both? This article was specifically discussing the failings of the POTUS, *not* Congress. We need to hold them *both* accountable. Im *sick to death* of people blaming Congress to excuse Obama, and vice versa. They have both been corrupted, and only drastic changes can get us out of such a desperate situation. &gt;but instead look seek some attack no matter how poorly grounded in reality. I know this will be an unpopular opinion here, but I *do* think this article is grounded in reality. I disagreed with just about every decision Bush made and I was very vocal about it. I disagree with the *majority* (but not all) of Obamas decisions, and for some reason, if I try to be vocal about my extreme disappointment in the current administration, it always becomes the fault of Republicans or Congress...*anything* to deflect attention away from the fact that the *system itself* seems to be broken. Your points would have more validity in the universe where the two party system hasnt been completely corrupted. This is not that universe. "
27096927095,"&gt;Except we are *here* and *now* with Obama, who has continued *and expanded* a lot of the same bullshit from the last administration. Weve withdrawn from one war and are in stepping down a second. He did temporarily increase troop numbers in Afghanistan, yet that was at the request of the military after the numbers had been shrunk to the point where there was not a large enough force to maintain its safety, let alone work towards stabilizing the region. Obama campaigned on ending the wars, this he has done. In this regard, there is no connection between LBJ and Obama. &gt;I think what sets him apart from Bush in this respect is that Obama *campaigned* on certain fundamental promises, the majority of which he has broken completely. With only 22% of his promises listed as broken, I find it hard to see where this statement is truthful. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/ &gt;Since Obama is still president, his history is still being written, and we need to hold him up to closer scrutiny than ever before.

This article was specifically discussing the failings of the POTUS, *not* Congress. We can blame both, but only for the actions each has taken. If someone campaigns on a stand, introduces legislation supporting that stand, and publicly works to promote that stand, it is unfair to hold them at fault when a different group refuse to allow discussion or a vote on that stand specifically to minimize the legacy of the first individual. This is the situation that has been occurring for years now. &gt;We need to hold them *both* accountable. Im *sick to death* of people blaming Congress to excuse Obama, and vice versa. Yes, they both need to be held accountable for what they do. Tell me, how many ideas and incentives, supported by the population at large, has Obama killed through use of his power to veto? How many has the house killed through use of the ability to keep a bill from being brought to a vote? &gt;I know this will be an unpopular opinion here, but I *do* think this article is grounded in reality. I stand by my decision to say its not. It makes false comparisons, unsubstantiated claims, and provides no real backing or rationale for its attacks. It is a political attack piece that might sound good to some on the outside, but holds no value or informative analysis. &gt;Your points would have more validity in the universe where the two party system hasnt been completely corrupted. &gt;This is not that universe. It doesnt have to be for my points to hold value, my points just need the backing of facts and logic. If you feel they dont have that, feel free to refute them with substantive arguments, for mere opinion is not of equal value to reality."

(you probably never heard of that one) - DOJ attorneys who represented Gitmo Terrorists - Obama has abandoned a ravaged Haiti (its out of the papers, you know) - Obamas Army Corps flooded millions of acres of farmland for no good reason, except the farmers happened to be Republicans. - Obama ignored flood ravaged Kentucky, surprise - they voted for Republicans. - 7 out of 10 Chrysler dealerships shut by Obamas forces were owned by Republicans. it just doesnt stop - this isnt about protecting the poor.

Quoting from the link, All the experts we have talked to were more than eager to acknowledge that Obama has done more to protect whistleblowers than any other president before him. But national security whistleblowers represent a glaring exception. The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than any president before. &gt; He didnt like warrantless wiretaps And he still doesnt. The program that youre referring to died in 2007. I think what youre trying to argue is the NSA spying scandal, but thats a different animal. Of course, in making all these (false) claims, youre ignoring all of Obamas achievements as president, of which there have been plenty.

27067290439,"The both parties are the same argument is generally a pro-right wing argument, meant to disenchant left-wing supporters or justify being a right-of-center Republican or libertarian who ends up voting GOP. Thats why you only see it on websites that lean left, like reddit. On right wing websites theyre too busy arguing what heinous crime against humanity they think Obama will commit next to bother talking about how voting for him wouldnt be any different from voting for his opponent."
27067524945,"No the both parties are the same argument is just that - an argument stating that both parties agree on many critical issues left out of the public frame. Issues such as foreign policy (middle eastern interventionism, Israel), monetary policy, economic policy (corporate bailouts), War on Terror and civil liberties (bipartisan support of NSA surveillance, police state), maybe even healthcare. Dont forget Romney developed Romneycare, which is what Obamacare [is based off of](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/mar/20/romneycare-and-obamacare-can-you-tell-difference/). So IMO, we would have had new healthcare regardless of who you voted for in 08. Both the left and the right dont like prosecuting their wall street friends. Obviously, the right works for wall street, but it was Obamas DOJ that refused to prosecute any high-level executive for mortgage fraud, instead deciding on a slap on the wrist in the form of fines. Sure there are differences - IE where people stand on the culture war which ultimately has little bearing on our country. Gay marriage being legal, the ten commandments in a courthouse, none of that has nearly as much bearing as, say, monetary policy and foreign policy, yet we seem to spend an inordinate amount of time focusing and arguing about social and moral issues rather than the concrete. Thats the playground that the politicians have built for the unwashed masses to play in. As long as we spend time getting into arguments that have no clear (or pertinent) answers, the plutocrats and their lobbyists will steer government via covet means and bribery. Its also becoming increasingly hard to talk about those critical issues as even reddit and r/politics mods seem to want to frame the agenda themselves, particularly away from foreign politics labeling it instead world politics, choosing to work from the particularly naive standpoint that American intelligence agencies dont have their fingers in almost every country and around every administration.

Source please? &gt; ACA required the health insurers to provide consumers with an ACA-compliant alternative. And are they cost regulated? Are they also told they could use an ACA state or federal website to find a comparable plan? Would love to see where these are hidden within the cancellation letters. Have a copy to share? And read your Politifact link (Which insidentally, politifact is proven wrong time after time) if you read it carefully enough, you will see where they say The president said this but told us he said that then go on to back up the administrations claims in the very next paragraph. Politifact is pretty good at outting themselves...."
26947130952,People that list their insurance due to Obamacare amounted to less than 0.5% of the US population. 
26947004191,I just had a friend on FB complain about how She got a letter from her insurance co that said it was canceling her plan. She called up her insurance broker and finds out a similar plan is more expensive. Cue all the anti-ACA replies. So I ask if she checked out the state exchange. She says she doesnt qualify....I tell her everyone can use plan but she may not qualify for any subsidies. Low and behold she goes on the exchange and finds a comparable plan for the same cost! Its amazing that people wont educate themselves on things that directly affect them and their wallets. 
26946948827,"Youre wasting your time. Its not that they dont understand everything youre saying, its that they dont give a fuck."
26946999995,"&gt; People who couldnt keep their insurance had shit plans that the ACA gets rid of. These plans are basically no plan at all. This lie has been repeated often, but many people had very good plans that were cancelled, and ended up signing up for plans with higher out of pocket costs that were more expensive under ACA. &gt;When the insurance companies started canceling these plans, had they pointed users to the Healthcare.gov site instead of selling them their own trumped up plans, most of these people would have seen they can get real insurance cheaper. ACA required the health insurers to provide consumers with an ACA-compliant alternative. &gt;The problem here is, instead of calling the president a liar, tell the people the truth of what is really going on. This way we dont end up with misconceptions and posts like this. The truth is that the President lied: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-what-hed-said-was-you-could-keep/"
26946950550,Good point
26946934833,"He lied or he under estimated the insurance companies greed and ruthlessness? People who couldnt keep their insurance had shit plans that the ACA gets rid of. These plans are basically no plan at all. When the insurance companies started canceling these plans, had they pointed users to the Healthcare.gov site instead of selling them their own trumped up plans, most of these people would have seen they can get real insurance cheaper. The problem here is, instead of calling the president a liar, tell the people the truth of what is really going on. This way we dont end up with misconceptions and posts like this. People need to educate themselves instead of only listening to talking points of the Gop"
26948987194,"No what you are using is Talking Point Memo facts. Basically all of what you said is spin and has been rejected by even typically Democrat friendly news sources. The only place that I have found that do not accept that the plans being canceled were due to regulatory choices made after the ACA was passed exist here on Reddit and on Thinkprogress, DailyKos, etc. No one believes it. Also saying Source: Facts, isnt convincing at all. http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/28/21213547-obama-admin-knew-millions-could-not-keep-their-health-insurance http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/30/obamas-pledge-that-no-one-will-take-away-your-health-plan/ http://www.factcheck.org/2013/11/keeping-your-health-plan/ Partisanship is like religion."
26947002006,"What he didnt count on was the fact that insurance companies would try and up-sell you instead of telling you the truth. Had the insurance companies not been scumbags, here is what their emails or cancellation letters would have looked like... Hey, Good news. The ACA says the so called health insurance you now have, isnt really health insurance at all. And, we agree. Sorry for taking advantage of you all of this time and making you pay for a plan that didnt cover anything until you reached your $100,000 per year deductible. And, a plan we would have kicked you off of anyway had you reached your deductible, and we had to start actually paying towards your bills. So, since your plan is now illegal because it was basically fraud, why dont you head on over to healthcare.gov and get a real plan which will more than likely be cheaper than the POS you were paying us for Source: FACTS! Not GOP taking points! "
26915954198,"So can someone tell me what Gattaca has to do with statism or tryanny or whatever? Is it Obamacare hes comparing it to? I love that movie, just wondering what its doing begin discussed in the House."
26915823945,Are we really doing this? Can we find nothing better to complain about politics right now? A fucking movie summary?
26915690184,"Same thing with Stand and Deliver, by the way. Same word for word quotation from the Wikipedia page. Lies and plagiarism no longer matter, as they did in [Joe Bidens day](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2008/08/the_write_stuff.html)."
26915724239,who gives a shit?
26915692994,"This is reaching. Like or hate Rand, this is one of the dumbest things to attack someone on. All politicians repeat what their writers give them. Who cares. "
26915823873,"Who gives a fuck. Rand Paul said that Gattaca provides a cautionary tale for what could happen, and then used lines in the Wikipedia article for the movie when explaining its plot. This is a failure on his speech writers part, but on the whole, is a total non-issue, being drummed up for political reasons."
26915757703,"Just a healthy reminder that even Rands recent push for a new [Constitutional Amendment](http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=1011) just so happens to be damn near word-for-word from a [2010 chain letter](http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/28thamendment.asp) circulating the right wing email spam. [Heres the breakdown!](http://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughPaulSpam/comments/1phvhy/you_know_rands_amendment_proposal_it_is_based_off/) This is likely even worse plagiarism given hes passing the idea off as his own, and you certainly wouldnt find any citations given by him. This guy would fail a simple TurnItIn submission!"
26915929051,"Um, do any politicians write their own speeches any more?"
26915743493,"It would tickle me to no end if Rand Paul actually wrote the wikipedia article on that movie. I now like to think of Rand Paul taking a day off every once in a while to sit down, watch an underrated or unwatched sci-fi movie and touch up the wikipedia articles on it."
26915899416,"To all the people trying to trivialize this by saying stuff like examine the substance of the speech instead his blatant, remorseless plagiarism... Hes arguing a slippery slope. Allowing abortions will lead to a Gattaca-esque world where the government determines who lives and dies etc. This is some inception level stupidity. On the surface of it, the plagiarism displays a lazy, dishonest work ethic when it comes to preparation. This will undoubtedly be reflected in his governance (parroting talking points and whatnot). One level deeper, the use of a logical fallacy to fearmonger. Allow abortions and the government will seize your hopes and dreams! Either he knows that this logic is invalid hence becoming nothing more than liar or he doesnt know its invalid, so hes incompetent. One level even deeper and were stuck in ideological limbo. We see how blinded he is by his conservatism. When you really think deeply, its a kind of fanaticism that would accomplish their goals at any cost. I mean to most conservatives, since their mission is noble, the ends justify their means. To most of you who are desperately trying to pivot away from this instead of critically evaluating his lack of integrity, ask yourselves why? Is essentially being lied to (not being told this speech was stolen) to persuade people into doing something or voting a certain way justified in a democracy? Hopefully this will shake you out of your stupor."
26915866695,isnt he just talking about... a movie...
26915715483,"Rubio, Paul, Cruz, these men seem so small. What makes them think they can be President of the United States."
26915939015,"Does anyone here realize that politicians dont write their own material? Most of the time someone else prepares remarks based on their views and guidelines. I cant imagine Paul has time to explore wikipedia for material to copy, but his aides, speechwriters, and interns probably do. This is probably an honest mistake on his part, and a fuck up on his teams part."
26915912260,I dont actually see anything wrong with him ripping off Wikipedia...whats the scandal?
26915828827,"The plagiarism bothers me. And his defense (given in an interview with Jorge Ramos of Fusion TV and Univision) is even worse. He really doesnt seem to understand what he did wrong. But theres something else. Hes trying to make a link between Obamacare and eugenics, or between abortion and eugenics. he thinks theyre related and hes trying to warn us about them. Its a stretch, I disagree that theres a real threat of it happening, but at least its a defensible position. But the strange thing is, why is he quoting from a movie? It would be one thing if he spoke about a modern politician. or a best-selling book that promoted such views, or if there was any country in the world that was doing it. Why a movie? If he had described the movie in his own words (or his speechwriters) it would bother me just as much. Doesnt anybody else see this?"
26916655178,I remember Obama doing something similar with just words speech. Now rand?
26916028367,"Apart from the plagiarism part, (yes, even that) I dont think Gattacas social commentary is one that Rand Paul would really want to be referencing to help his cause. Where does he get ideas like this?"
26915643219,The best part is him claiming its not plagiarism because he didnt claim to have written Gattaca. 
26915670163,"Doesnt matter. Rand Paul could strangle a kitten on live TV and his drones would still insist that just because kitten strangling is bad, its not the governments job to legislate against it, while squeezing in buzz words like freedom, liberty, tyranny, statist, charity, voluntary, and second amendment in there somewhere. "
26915525973,Who cares? Its a summary of a movie. 
26915986956,Plot twist: he wrote the Wikipedia entry
26915929165,Where are all those people that complained about manufactured scandals when it dealt with Obamas misdeeds?
26915787092,So his speechwriter got lazy. Im not seeing a controversy.
26915906315,Sadly for Paul there are still some with the ability to read and think. He is nothing more than a political hack trading on his fathers name. Sound familiar?
26915630866,[What?](http://i.imgur.com/pg4TGl2.png)
26915741396,"I was at the speech Monday. In context, it just sounded like he was summarizing the movie. Probably should have used different phrasing, but I dont have an issue with it. "
26916026440,Why the fuck would he be talking about eugenics anyway? 
26915630446,At least he avoided the Pokemon movie. 
26915942645,Maybe it will at least encourage more people to watch that awesome film.
26915555431,"Yes, its true, And this is not the first time. And it will most likely happen again because he doesnt seem intelligent enough to understand the definition of plagiarism. Im sure there is a wiki for that."
26915828133,"This is really sad for the state of r/politics that this non issue is being discussed as front page material. I might not be a fan of Rand Paul, but this honestly just seems like the reddit circlejerk hivemind upvoting anything that seems funny and puts down republicans regardless of the relevance. I sincerely hope that there isnt a soul out there that goes to r/politics for their news source, since its warped beyond reality"
26915801639,"In this thread: People that dont understand the difference between quoting a movie and repeating someone elses summary of it. Imagine youre a movie reviewer and you wrote a summary of a movie in your review. Then someone repeated your summary and instead of crediting you, they credited the movie. If you dont understand the difference, please re-read the last paragraph until you do. "
26915806394,"It is fairly stupid to rip on Rand for something minor like this, but it carries larger undertones than just reciting someone elses thought. This man has no originality and seems less intelligent than anyone in public office should. Im going to feel so bad for Ron Paul when his son is more successful in a presidential election running off terms like haters and quoting drab fiction like Atlas Shrugged and Gataca. This dude is a fucking gym teacher, not a presidential nominee or even a decent senator."

26915837875,Plot twist: Rand Paul wrote the Wikipedia entry for Gattica.

26915540010,Too bad I give maddow zero credibility after her fake as fuck ama. 
26915651577,"Havent heard the speech, but its strikes me as irrelevant whether or not its original material. If you want to attack the ideas thats fine, but who cares where the ideas came from, they should be vetted on their own merit regardless of source."
26915677338,I dont judge the quality of a speech on its originality. In fact we would all be better off if politicians actually listened to good ideas of others more often. 
26915708708,"Blah, this isnt news. Rand cited the movie and took snippets from Wikipedia..big deal. Especially in a 25 minutes speech where 99.9% of the speech was original. Cherry picker.

26915794006,"Just the first attempt at many to slander Paul. &gt; We borrowed the plot lines from Gattaca. It¡¯s a movie, Paul told Fusion. I gave credit to the people who wrote the movie. Seems to end all it all there. Movies have great quotes, why not borrow a few in a speech? Thats kind of smart."
26915799901,Right now I would rather take a president who reads anything Wiki than our current one who knows nothing until it hits the news.
26915802777,"Look, I usually subscribe to the liberal way of thinking. But, am I the only one that saw the editing of this piece as something to blatantly smear Paul? Im zooming back from any political thinking here, but if one of his advisers said, This would be great for you to quote!, that he wouldnt bat an eye? I mean, these guys (gals) have to give speeches all the time. It bugs me that news anchors, be it Rachel Maddow or Bill OReilly get to call out sound bites of speeches to promote their own political ideology. I just would like to be a part of a political discourse that didnt involve sensationalism..."
26915803777,"Im going to go ahead and guess she wouldnt say the same about Joe Biden, who has done pretty much the exact same thing. "
26915805604,Obama has a team of speech writers and cant function without a teleprompter. Nuff said.
26915811578,Nobody likes Rand anyways

26915838435,"Look, so did Martin Luther King Jr., and hes OK."
26915865291,So what? Its not like he tried to sell it as a book. Rachel Maddow reminds me of all the English teachers which couldnt find something wrong with what I wrote but just wanted to point out I was wrong . . . somehow.

26915895781,At first I liked the article. Then there was the part where it was claimed that borrowing one sentence is plagiarism. I didnt like it anymore. 
26915898966,He should have gotten an intern to write it!
26915903743,This is how I assume it went down. Paul had to give a speech to support this candidate so his speech writers set to work as they are known to do with a list of points that should be covered. They either have a lazy member of the team or a college intern who doesnt give a shit rip some lines from the wiki article. His job was to cover the eugenics talking point and he procrastinated. Nobody checked it out because speeches are rarely plagirized and Rand Paul ends up looking like a moron. 
26915911279,The creative bankruptcy of his speechwriters doesnt bother me so much as the ridiculous and tired slippery slope argument that womens reproductive rights will lead to eugenics.
26915913341,"A speechwriter will likely be fired here, but the fault is not on Rand, personally. Was Rands story ripped from Wikipedia, yes. Is it a big deal? No. "
26915914495,"Who cares? What annoys me is he was using it as a cautionary tale, which is absurd. There is nothing in that movie that needs cautioning against, except perhaps the roadside DNA checks. "
26915914781,"Maddow just got caught plagiarizing a liberal blogger in a real report. Watch Pauls whole speech, he talks about that he is giving a description of a movie...do you want footnotes in case it is from the back of the DVD case, imdb, or wiki? "
26915914956,He lifted plot points about the movie from the article. I dont care about that but about the major points he made in his essays. The rest is just backbiting. 
26915931673,The manufactured outrage in this thread is pathetic... Obama gets a pass for drone strikes and massive spying because he reads words a speech writer wrote yet we are keying in on this bullshit? This is pathetic 
26915932222,"Rachel Maddow accusing somebody else of plagiarism? Hasnt Maddow also been accused of plagiarism at least once? Oh, wait. If it didnt get fact checked by PolitiFact it doesnt count, right?"
26915933715,I assume politicians dont actually write their speaches. As in they get their assistants to do it for them.
26915934483,Must be time for /r/politics to ban the politifact domain..
26915937142,"To be expected as Paul is from the generation who believe its okay to lie, plagiarize, cheat, and steal to get what you want; its endemic to the entire batch of graduates from about 76 to present day. Big money - they got exactly what they needed and most likely at a tidy price !"
26915938443,rachel maddow is a sick dike 
26915939393,"Rachel Maddow is the last person I would get news from. She is similar to Perez Hilton, only she focuses on political persons."
26915949999,"With quality posts like this making the top page, one must wonder how this fine bastion of political discourse was relegated from its default status? I mean if I did what Rand Paul did on a book report in 4th grade I surely would have gotten an F... This is an unacceptable double standard. Seriously though this is definitely more important than the NSA and the failed Obamacare rollout. Drone on friends."
26915965827,"Its amazing to me that this is even newsworthy. Only partisan hacks like Maddow/Limbaugh would actually spend their time complaining about how Rand Paul repeated facts verbatim, and the real news of the day is how Barack Obama lied saying, if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it. I think Rand and his father are morons, but to complain about a politician stating truths and how he is being truthful is about as lame as it gets. "
26915980531,Politifact busted a politicians speech writer for borrowing lines in a few of the hundreds of speeches written. So brave. Thats exactly the type of accountability Im expecting!
26915984405,"But to be fair, politifact also rated TRUE to Obamas claim that everyone would be able to keep their current health insurance plan. "
26916012025,Who cares
26916014190,"More bad journalism... its the same information on IMDB, using terms from the original work of fiction. Which was probably written by the PR for the movie."
26916020934,"Did Maddow also point out Obamas plagiarism, JFKs or MLK? No? Didnt think so. Please keep drinking the red stuff. also who gives a shit... really?"
26916030113,I love how the gravity of eugenics is completely lost over Marrows quest to bash someone on the right.

26916193858,"SO WHAT? If the content was something Paul agreed with and he wanted it to be heard...so what? Fuck off Maddow. Go shill for the CFR some more, youre nothing more than a talking head for the establishment."
26916222038,Re-purpose - reuse - recycle. So what is the problem ? :-)
26916226835,this is soo not an issue. maddow should focus on actual news items - it isnt like there are not a ton of real social issues out there...
26916266993,Im not sure why you would quote anything related to Gattaca from that perspective anyways. Ethan Hawkes character was really the bad guy for the entirety of the film. 
26916338256,"I am not a Paul fan, but is this really something to get worked up about? Sure, a Senator plagiarizing never looks good, but it was plot lines from a movie. If he were outlining some policy initiative and it was ripped off from someone but movie plots? It is describing something that isnt in question. Its embarrassing for him and he shouldve changed it up from the wiki page but its not a big deal."
26916379733,God I hate Rachel Maddow. All the fucking shit-headed republicans in the world and she picks Rand Paul to bust on.
26916385431,"OMG. This is serious. Lets all focus on a persons speech having similarities to wikipedia article, and ignore the government spying on everything we do online. Impeach Rand Paul!"

Its nearly December. If they were going to create a diversion, wouldnt have they done it sooner? On a related note, if you read Richard Clarks book about the search for bin Laden, Clinton was the first Pres to really understand what a threat bin Laden was. I am 95% sure IIRC that Clintons wag the dog bombing was an attempt at taking out bin Laden. Could have saved us from 9/11....and the goddamn TSA. Source: http://www.snopes.com/rumors/clinton.asp Last but not least, to the person who made the comment about stealing the wag the dog line from the movie: I believe the term wag the dog had been around for quite a while and was common among politicos. The movie swiped that term, not the other way around... Edit: added a source for Clinton. Couldnt find one for my assertion on wag the dog. I may be wrong on that one but am leaving it until someone shows me a source that proves it..."

27140880098,funny how today this ended up on the [front page](http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/nevada.asp) 
26719546845,"You really ought to try to figure out what the Republican message IS before you bash it. I know Dems like to think that Republicans want people to die in the street. But to your point - &gt; Americans are actually getting kinder over time, and we all do want to be better, which is why we rally around one-off causes like supporting bombing and kidnap victims with gobs of cash. The response to this has been 100% consistent with R principles, and inconsistent with D principles. Rs believe that its not the governments job to help my neighbor. Its mine. Ds believe that ultimately you as an individual have no personal responsibility to help your neighbor - thats the governments job. Look at [studies/articles](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79888.html) about charitable donations, for example. Dems are charitable with other peoples money. Rs are charitable with their own. One of those things counts as charity, one does not. Which one of these principles reflects a kinder society, where people want to be better? Id argue that one position reflects those beliefs, and one does not. And that your apparent interpretation is quite backward. "
26719688572,"First, wealthy does not equal Republican - sorry, but its true. As Ive mentioned elsewhere, compare wealth (by county, by state, whatever) to voting patterns. The wealthy vote Democrat. As to the great depression, I agree - Hoover overreacted. And then of course FDR prolonged the depression by destroying any incentive for people to work in the private sector (or work doing anything of substance). Why get a real job when you can get paid more money by the [federal government to move dirt from here to there?](http://www.auduboninstitute.org/visit/zoo/exhibits-and-attractions/monkey-hill)"
26719636094,"First of all, I question the biases of the MIT research when they open by saying that conventional wisdom is that Rs are wealthy and Ds are not (a quick comparison of per capita incomes in red v blue states will put the kibosh on that conventional wisdom. As far as their denigration of the way the conservative/liberal question was asked in the survey brooks used, I really dont see how asking a question like, Thinking politically and socially, how would you describe your own general outlookas being very conservative, moderately conservative, middle-of-the-road, moderately liberal or very liberal? could give you skewed results; aside from the fact there arent a whole hell of a lot of people that fall in the economically liberal/socially conservative category (or vice versa), Im somewhat at a loss as to why THIS survey (ie the one that shows the answer the MIT folks dont like) is so clearly the flawed one. Second, its a little ridiculous that they control for religiosity. Thats part of the dynamic. If you control for EVERY SINGLE FACTOR other than R or D, could you come out even? Perhaps. But controlling for every single factor misses the forest for the trees. Why dont we control for whether someone is a conservative or a liberal too? Im sure theres someone somewhere that identifies as a liberal but votes Republican, and theres probably someone that identifies as conservative but votes Dem. Lets base our statements on those two guys. To your comparison of police and healthcare, police do not provide a service to me or you. They perform a direct service to society that provides a direct societal benefit. Healthcare on the other hand requires that you confiscate wealth from the American people to provide services to individuals. Further, and this point is often missed, it ultimately means that you give providers no free market in which to sell their services. To your points about costs, that in large part is due to the already overbearing presence of government in the health insurance market. The third party payer problem eliminates competition on the part of insurers, and eliminates any internalization of cost on the part of the insured. If you and I were responsible for buying our own insurance as a general rule (rather than having our employers say, this is what you get), you better believe wed shop around for rates, coverages, whatever else. Further, coverage mandates drive up costs as well. Theres a reason an individual policy bought on the free market (I bought one a few years ago, back when Barack Obama was an obscure State Senator from Chicago) varied so much from state to state. Without specifying states, I bought at the same time as a friend. We were both young (early 20s). We were both fairly healthy. We both looked at similar/base plans from the same insurer. I paid $120 a month in a solid red state. My friend paid over $400 a month in a solid blue state. In what world is it reasonable to tell a single, 20-something guy that he has to buy insurance that covers abortion, or pregnanc"
26719683582,"As to the second part, Ill just state that Ive lived in both quite conservative and quite liberal (news flash - the DC area is QUITE liberal) areas. Are people going to flat out admit (or even recognize, potentially) that they dont take any personal responsibility? Of course not. But from observation, people in this (again overwhelmingly) Dem area reflexively rely on the government to help their neighbors. Example - Ive been to neighborhood assn/HOA meetings in multiple communities in this area, and the topic of helping the less fortunate comes up occasionally as you might imagine at a meeting like that. And the go-to source that is always settled on is government. Government run homeless shelter, government run food bank - lets point people to that! In conservative communities I have lived/spent time in, its people are hungry in our neighborhood? Lets start up a community run food bank! Quite simply, people have outsourced any responsibility to their fellow man. Its sad. As to whether communities can meet that need, Id encourage you to read up on the response to Hurricane Katrina (Dems love to bash the federal response; I actually do as well, but unlike Dems I dont think it was anything particular W, Brownie, whoever did - it was an inherent flaw with government). I mean, shit - whos the first on the ground anywhere? Its not FEMA. Its the Red Cross. I spent time in SE LA shortly after the hurricane. People were not getting help from the government - state, federal, or local. They were getting help from charity (generally church organizations, actually, but the Red Cross to some extent too). When FEMA was still trying to pull its head out of its ass and keep ice (that it overpaid for) from melting on loading docks, church groups, RC, etc were trucking in food, trucking in volunteers. Food was available in central locations that were publicized in the community if you could get there, and if you couldnt it was delivered. The number one provider of drinking water? It wasnt the federal government - it was [Anheuser-Busch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canned_water) (they switched several bottling lines from canning beer to canning water; I kept one as a souvenir but it was unfortunately lost in a move). The government finally got its shit together right around the time its help was completely unnecessary. "
26719649810,"With all due respect, the handful of wealthy Republicans you worked with are not representative of the party as a whole. And I find it pretty amusing that you with a straight face call yourself an independent. I can absolutely assure you that I work with MANY more Republicans, across the spectrum - from high dollar donors, to grassroots folks with no money (but plenty of free time). The need for social services has not changed substantively. Democrats handing out money to people that wouldnt have gotten it from the government (but instead from their Church, or a community social aid organization/etc) in the past has. As far as your insistence that corporations pay taxes, please - tell me how that works. Because when taxes on Walmart, for example, go up, my prices go up. People pay taxes - guess how that tax is paid? My prices go up - sticking it to the lower/middle class, as you so eloquently put it. As for talking about how the evil rich are not paying taxes and the poor do, for fucks sake - get out a tax table and calculate the percentages. If you want taxes to go up on the rich, so be it. But dont pretend that the rich pay a lower proportion of their income than the middle class - its simply inaccurate. As to compliance, Id be all about the tax code being tossed out. A flat rate tax, or a consumption tax, would be great. But if youve paid any attention, the special treatment in the tax code is in large part a creation of the Democrats (remember that the 1986 tax code was written by a Democrat House). "
26719555120,"the problem is that Rs are charitable with their own is false. Ds definitely do not have a good system figured out, but lauding the Rs as some sort of benevolent givers is horrifyingly inaccurate. this is backup up by historical fact. President Hoover proved this theory was utter and complete bullshit when the majority of America was suffering from the Great Depression. Presidential call-to-arms of the wealthy Americans to help the less fortunate was such an abysmal failure that shanty towns were fucking /named/ after him because of peoples disgust toward his apparent lack of competence. I dont believe Ds have the best answer, but Rs most definitely do not have any sort of acceptable answer, period. Our public has showed time and time again that money &gt; compassion. "
26719664561,"What do you think churches do with their money? They dont burn it - they spend it in the community. Since youre speaking somewhat condescendingly of church giving, I hope Im not going out on a limb by assuming you rarely (if ever) attend one. Ive got homework for you. Go to a church Sunday morning. If you dont want to sit through the sermon, just duck in, grab a bulletin, and slip out the side door before all the praying starts. And read through the charitable opportunities. Just about any church in the country will have dozens of them - feeding the homeless at a soup kitchen, staffing the churchs food pantry, delivering (and recieving) donations of clothes/furniture/etc. There are costs involved in those things - and those things benefit the community. Feel free to trust the government to provide all the help you need - but working in the field I do, I can assure you that the government (and its provision of social aid) is dysfunctional on a good day. Regarding states receiving funds from DC - first, those numbers are QUITE stale. That said, is the amount of funding the federal government sucks up, only to send back to states with strings attached an issue? Absolutely. If our tax code (and government hierarchies) were structured as the Constitution/founders envisioned, you would be paying the highest taxes to your local govt, followed by state, followed by federal. Unfortunately it doesnt work that way, and the federal government sucks up money so that it can bribe and cajole states into homogeneity. The thing is, most Americans dont WANT to have to rely on a federal safety net - but theyre given no choice. When the federal government sucks up 15% of your income to nominally cover Social Security and Medicare (news flash - youre paying the employer share; your employer earmarks it toward employing you, and itd be in your pocket if they didnt have to pay it), then yes - people reasonably believe that they have a right to those services. Go figure. Of course, like anything else, the government is completely unable to provide that coverage in a cost effective way, and instead operates a shell game that would get those managing any private company or insurer providing similar coverage prosecuted and thrown in jail. "
26719557647,"&gt; Rs believe that its not the governments job to help my neighbor. Its mine. Ds believe that ultimately you as an individual have no personal responsibility to help your neighbor - thats the governments job. Since I live in probably the reddest of red states and virtually every person I deal with is hard-core conservative, I can verify the first part of your claim (about the Rs), as I have personally heard this sentiment proudly and publicly stated *numerous* times. However, I do not believe the second claim (about the Ds claiming no personal responsibility for their neighbor because its the governments job). I have *never* heard anyone (R or D) ever say such a thing. In fact, I have read and heard numerous liberal leaning folks say exactly the opposite -- that we all have personal responsibility for our neighbors, even though that does not excuse the government (which also is all of us) from doing its part (which in many cases simply *cannot* be done adequately on an individual or charitable organization level). "
26719587138,"MIT research says otherwise. Political affiliation has no bearing on amount of charity, just to which charities people donate. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2148033 So it is not that one group is inherently more charitable than the other. Things like roads, power, internet, firemen, police, etc are all either government run or heavily taxpayer subsidized because they are things that individuals cannot do effectively. Our responsibility to each other can only be fulfilled by both charity and effective use of government but not simply one or the other. As an example about health care I like to use the analogy what if police departments were not government funded? Society would incur some very high costs due to crime, lawlessness, vigilantism, and the resulting socioeconomic impacts. Policing would become a privilege reserved for those who could afford police insurance while others would be hesitant to call the police for fear of not being able to pay the bill. Health care is the same. With our current for-profit system we incur very high costs from things like insurance overhead, bankruptcies from care, lack of preventative care due to cost, high costs due to ER overuse, and the fear factor of being one illness away from losing your lifes savings and home. Health care is a privilege reserved for those who can afford health insurance while others are hesitant to get care for fear of not being able to pay the bill. With this analogy it is easy to see that socialized healthcare makes sense just like a socialized police department. Nobody should suffer economic ruin due to no fault of their own. If anybodys home is robbed the police should investigate and recover their property at no extra cost. If anybody gets cancer they should get the care they need to recover at no extra cost. In either case of police or health, charity cannot *guarantee* these things for all americans. It is not about charity vs government but about most effectively, efficiently, fairly, and *totally* (nobody excluded) fulfilling our most important social responsibilities to each other."
26719563232,"The problem is when things like money given to churches or other similar institutions counts as charity, like Romneys compulsory tithe to the Mormon Church. Meanwhile, red states [take more money from the federal government than they pay in taxes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/26/blog-posting/red-state-socialism-graphic-says-gop-leaning-state/), all while complaining about taxes at every possible chance. And of course, when something goes wrong, theyre always ready to stand in line with one hand outstretched for federal handouts and the other hand giving the finger (see: Texas on the fertilizer explosion). Ultimately, Id rather have a social safety net guaranteed by the state than have to rely on someone elses charity in my time of need. So do most Americans, whether they think so or not - thats why attacking Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is tantamount to political suicide."
26719570080,"With all due respect, your perception of Republican principles and reality are incompatible with one another. I dont say that as a Democrat, but as a political independent who knows better after working with powerful and wealthy Republicans over several decades. &gt;Rs believe that its not the governments job to help my neighbor. Its mine. Ds believe that ultimately you as an individual have no personal responsibility to help your neighbor - thats the governments job. First, creating charity cases of ones fellow Americans is not an American ideal yet that is the growing direct result of Conservative economic and fiscal public policies over 30 years (and counting). If self-reliance was the Republican goal, it would have succeeded in creating LESS need for social services NOT more. Since many Republicans conveniently forget, the U.S. economy and budget tanked on their watch from their public policies. Blaming the consequences from Republican policies on Democrats is beyond disingenuous and an outright lie. Second, if Republicans believe the government has no meaningful role in this society, why do they insist upon being its largest beneficiaries through Federal Reserve monetary policy, tax cuts, subsidies, no-bid contracts, etc. That, too, is inconsistent with their principles. It should be noted that the U.S. is getting its ass handed to it in global trade because U.S. trading partner governments LEAD macroeconomic policy making, NOT their private sectors. Abdicating economic policy-making to multinational corporations amounts to economic suicide and this is blatantly evident across the U.S. You claim that Democrats are charitable with other peoples money, yet it is Republicans who allow their true constituents (i.e., top 1% and large corporations) to avoid paying taxes while sticking it to the lower/middle class. Shifting that tax burden to others means Republicans are spending OTHER peoples money, to quote your disdain. Furthermore, since Republicans have seen fit to blow up the national budget and persistently refuse to raise taxes based on where the money actually resides, they make matters worse by championing burdensome tax policies on those who can least afford to shoulder it thereby worsening national poverty and the need for social services. Third, as someone more than a little familiar with the charitable giving and tax compliance of very wealthy people, I can assure you that as individual incomes rise, the amount of charitable giving FALLS. You are peddling a myth to try to unjustly lower tax rates for people who dont deserve to get tax breaks. Finally, Conservatives dont have a messaging problem, they have a deeply flawed and self-destructive ideology PROBLEM. Championing broken ideological beliefs and policies is NOT a formula for success, no matter what Modern Conservatives tell themselves. Frank Luntz may be a master of disguising that failure, but it is STILL failure and always will be. So throw away Franks lipstick and use that Randian hog to throw a barbecue instead. Its the only way Republicans will stand any chance of remaining relevant in this society."

Just get rid of them, its fucking frightening that people have to put a burden on their children when they die. Um...burden?

27082390489,"Excerpt: The basis for the line was Governor Palins 11 September 2008 appearance on ABC News, her first major interview after being tapped as the vice-presidential nominee. During that appearance, interviewer Charles Gibson asked her what insight she had gained from living so close to Russia, and she responded: Theyre our next-door neighbors, and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska: As to the question of whether one can actually see Russia from Alaska, Governor Palin was correct: such a view is possible from more than one site in that state. A Slate article on the topic noted that: In the middle of the Bering Strait are two small, sparsely populated islands: Big Diomede, which sits in Russian territory, and Little Diomede, which is part of the United States. At their closest, these two islands are a little less than two and a half miles apart, which means that, on a clear day, you can definitely see one from the other. Also, a 1988 New York Times article reported that: To the Russian mainland from St. Lawrence Island, a bleak ice-bound expanse the size of Long Island out in the middle of the Bering Sea, the distance is 37 miles. From high ground there or from the Air Force facility at Tin City atop Cape Prince of Wales, the westernmost edge of mainland North America, on a clear day you can see Siberia with the naked eye.

26919937678,"I blame the ACA for being fundamentally flawed - it is a health insurance mandate. It is *not* universal health care. If it was, then we shouldnt even be having this problem."
26920141329,"i hope you realize that the ACA was written by the insurance companies, how awesome would it be if you were forced to buy their product. this is exactly what the ACA is. a direct tax to insurance companies. why anyone would be for this is inconceivable. either we are going to have regular free market insurance or single payer, not this profit driven bullshit envisioned by the insurance companies. everyone agrees the insurance companies are crooks, so why do we want them controlling this whole thing? kick those fuckers out, fuck this fascism."
26920337944,"I guess the obvious question is, how did this article get approved by Fox News?"
26920651022,"really, pass a bill that changes a huge portion of the economy without reading whats inside it and you expect people to blame people other than those who wrote and approved it. Youve become a joke r/politics"
26920249477,"Nevermind the fact that the FedGov was responsible for fucking up the healthcare market ***in the first place***. No, of course we have to ignore that, because government is a shining beacon of hope, casting its clean light through the darkness and evil that is humanity. Except of course that governments are responsible for killing more people in the history of humanity than any other cause. "
26920327431,Does anyone else see this as one of the most capitalistic things that we passed? You are required to buy insurance from a private insurance company or suffer to pay a fine. I see this as a complete win for the insurance companies. Edit: I accidentally a word
26920372998,"universal healthcare would have fixed it, you cant regulate these private companies into doing the right thing. They will exploit every loophole possible to not insure you or cover as little as possible to continue profits"
26920335488,"Stop, collaborate and listen. This is an insurance MANDATE. Meaning, insurance companies realized, Hey, we should make everyone HAVE to have healthcare then did some financying, and boom, realized that paying Obama a sum of money to make this happen still would be a drop in the bucket compared to what they will make when there is 100% enrollment."
26920313856,People are going to blame Obama and the ACA for this. Obama said that everybody could keep their insurance and he was wrong.
26921088396,"This is propaganda bullshit. No surprise from Fox. (Red/blue doesnt matter to them as much as having titillating stories.) It says that people should be angry at their insurance companies for not providing essential health benefits. Well, who decided to settle for the cheaper insurance policies to begin with? If you want your insurance to pay for an ambulance ride, guess what? You should shop for and buy a policy that pays for ambulance rides. You want mental health parity? Shop for and buy a policy that covers it. Of course such policies are more expensive; welcome to an economy. Yes, the government is forcing people to get better insurance, and in many cases thus forcing them to pay more for insurance. Even if the end result is a healthier country, the fact remains that people are being forced to buy specific products, whether they want it or not, for their own good. Nike usually makes nice shoes. Back when I had a pair of Nike sneakers, I admit the shoe aspect of my life was noticeably improved in some ways. But I no longer have them, and for many reasons (financial, moral, aesthetic, functional, or whatever reason I damn well please) I do not desire to buy another pair. I view the ACA as equivalent to forcing every American to buy a pair of Nike sneakers. You refuse? Pay a fine. You refuse to pay? Have your wages garnished. You structure your finances to resist? Go to jail. You refuse and resist the cops? Get forcibly arrested. You resist, which necessitates violence against the police? Get shot and die. God Bless America^TM"
26920135424,The insurance companies that dumped money into Obamas campaign and helped write the PPACA bill? *Those* insurance companies?
26920023700,"So, we allowed the market to regulate insurance, and insurance became low cost covering almost nothing. So now we have a minimum standard being enforced by regulations. Of course there will be insurance companies doing the minimum. "
26920062868,"This is a terrible argument. The promise was If you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance. This literally means that even if your insurance is shitty, you can choose to keep it rather than enrolling in a new plan thats ACA-approved. The whole reason for the promise was BECAUSE people were afraid of their rates going up and having to take coverage for things they didnt need, which is exactly what has happened. You cant now claim that Americans should have known that actually meant You can keep your insurance as long as the government ALSO likes it. That is a total non-promise and basically means If youre already complying with the new system, you can continue to comply! which functionally means nothing."
26920587532,"Licensed insurance agent here. The reason your current plans are being discontinued is because they dont meet the requirements as an ACA plan. To qualify the plan must: 1.) Include the 10 Essential Health Benefits 2.) Must meet the minimum standard of a Bronze level, so you will not pay more than 9.5% of your yearly income. Now what most people need to understand is that you may qualify for a premium tax credit that can lower your monthly premiums and also get a plan that can lower your cost shares, such as deductibles and copays, when you use your benefits. Many of the plans youre being offered are based on your Federal Poverty Level which is calculated by your household size and income. If you are less than 138% you would qualify for Medicaid. If your between 139% and 250% you will some form of tax credit either in a monthly deduction or in a lump sum at the end of the year in your tax return. All the plans you would get are EXACTLY THE SAME. The only difference is how much you will be paying in premium vs your out of pocket expenses. Also many if your preventative services (screening, physicals. mammograms. Pap smears, GYN exams, flu shots, etc) are covered in full. Bronze plans were designed for someone who rarely go to the doctor and would rather save on the cost of their premiums per month, use their preventative services only and have the insurance cover them if something catastrophic happens. Silver has a larger premium than bronZe but less out of pockets expenses, yet still a high deductible plan if you dont qualify for a cost share reduction Gold and Platinum plans have a higher premium per month but your deductibles and copays are minimal or 0. Most plans have an out of pocket maximum, which acts as a safety net if you use a lot of your services in any given year. If you meet the OOPM you will be covered at 100% for the remainder of the year as long as you continue to pay your premium So, yes, the poor do get better deals on these plans to make it more affordable but if you are upper middle class or rich, you can afford to pay the premiums you just dont want to because Americans are self centered and greedy. I talk to people all day long about this stuff everyday and its either hit or miss with the reactions. ***Those that qualify for Medicaid are either happy because it will help cover their medical costs or pissed but they have a stigmatism toward being on welfare. ***Those that fall between a FPL of 138% and 199% think the ACA is the best thing that has ever happened. Everyone above 200% are pissed because this was supposed to be more affordable and have to blame Obama for their situation. So before you start blaming the providers think about the fact that they are being required to change the way business is done in order to follow the law. I agreed it could have been done a lot better but it is what it is and theres nothing we can do but complain to our congressman which falls on deaf ears anyway. Should have voted for Ron Paul, America. "
26920129417,So is it technically illegal for health insurers to continue selling these swiss-cheese coverage policies or are they just dumping them because they can no longer characterize them as insurance? 
26920352052,"Holy shit. I tend to look at all media with a skeptical eye, so Im not trying to sound biased here but I cant believe this is a Fox News link. Itd be similar to seeing MSNBC publish an article agreeing with Ted Cruz. Kind of refreshing to see, really."
26919804078,Thats the damn truth. The insurance companies have always been the issue and continue to be the issue. I got into an argument with someone over the weekend who was trying to tell me that a friend of a friend already got fined for not purchasing insurance because ObamaCare removed her from the plan she just purchased and said she hadnt done it. 
26921186693,My premium went from 100 to 300 dollars. 
26920188979,"I thought this was a law. Meaning everything is written down somewhere outlining all of the provisions. I know that it was a crazy long bill, but each word of it was voted into law. If Obama was saying all of this stuff in his speeches and it was wrong according to the bill, how was his wording never corrected before? (Especially because this was such a big concern over the ACA before it was voted into law)"
26919884194,Although this is a good article I am surprised that the mods arent considering Fox a partisan site.
26919959074,"No. Im gonna blame Obama too. He handed them the pen, he lied about not having to change. Theyre all on the same team."
26920343230,Unfortunately Obama just handed the ball off to the insurance companies.
26920391486,The problem is the ACA forces insurance companies to provide better insurance which i believe is the reason that the companies are dropping coverage in the first place
26920431933,Am I going crazy!? Even Foxnews says dont blame Obama! Who knew they were capable of telling the truth for once. Looks like the tide is finally turning against the super capitalist oil barons and the Kochtopus New World Order. 
26919849915,Side rant: these are people oppose expanding Medicaid to help poor people getting better health care - thats an actual quote from this article. Its getting harder and harder to find articles without glaring spelling or grammatical issues these days. And this is from a professional journalist.

26920262827,"I heard a woman on the radio this morning complaining that her insurance premium was jumping from ~$280/mo to ~$600/mo. I thought this was unreasonable until she said she was also qualified for a $300/mo federal subsidy. What really got me angry was when she said she was upset about not seeing any benefits from paying more...ignoring the fact that she now has better health insurance because the ACA prevents a lot of deceptive insurance practices that she no longer is subject to. edit: unreasonable, not reasonable"
26920151765,"First this sub called anyone claiming their insurance was canceled a liar. Then they used the excuse that the insurance those that had their policies canceled was substandard. Then you blamed the states for not implementing exchanges. Now its the insurance companies faults. Is liberalism inherently this disingenuous, or are you people simply running for cover? "
26920074447,This would be like saying the government ¡°forces¡± chemical companies to dispose of toxic waste safely rather than dumping it in the river. Im pretty sure these are the types of Regulations the Republicans talk about all then time.

26919872346,Fox News is on the front page now? Im trying to not unsubscibe but its getting harder every day.
26920292802,"The purpose of the ACA, and why its called the Affordable Care Act to begin with, is to allow people who previously would have been unable to purchase health insurance because of a pre-existing condition or because it was too expensive, thus the subsidies. The young healthy sector of the population already had affordable health care available to them. Private companies would decline people over the most minor pre-existing condition or for sure exclude any coverage related to it from the policy. The best part about the whole act which people dont realize is theyre being forced by the government to buy something from private companies. Also, insurance isnt a charity, and you can be sure the people crunching numbers are going to know what rates must be charged to keep the companies afloat. The people who will see the biggest financial impact are young entrepreneurs. If their business is successful, they wont be subsidy elgible AND will be paying higher rates to make up for the increase in claim volume and pay out by the people now being allowed into the health insurance pool. "

26919930089,"Somewhat agree, except that I took out a high deductible policy with other insurance policies for critical health to match my current needs. I dont mind switching to something different if it works better for everyone, but all changes result in winners and losers."

26920302181,"Insurance companies are businesses, not charities. "
26920349287,"Saying that the cancellations are the insurance companies fault is misleading because, even though the cancellations were made the the insurance companies, it was in direct response to the regulatory structure set up in Obamacare.

As long as a government employee, whether it be the president or whomever, believes they are acting in my best interest, they can lie to me all they want, I trust them. Maybe Obama did know that some people werent gonna be able to keep their coverage, but if he had told the truth the bill might not have passed. The end justifies the means. "

26919997373,"I am amazed that people find this shocking still. This was never about providing healthcare for the masses. This was about ensuring capitalism and the insurance companies maintain a profit. Providing healthcare to the masses leads to a universal healthcare plan where it is taxed from the people and coverage is free and sponsored by the taxes. This bill simply makes it mandatory for people to have to buy insurance from the private sector companies under the guise of regulation. Come the fuck on, am I the only one here that sees this buckshot for what it is?!?!"

26920080448,This article is misleading at best. ACA REQUIRED insurance policies to have full coverage for things that some people dont need. Liked pre-naale coverage and breastpumps for a single male.

Kind of like being mad at a lion for attacking you.

26920161358,"Man, what a shitstorm. I feel torn because there should be absolutely no reason to deny anyone health coverage. This feels like such a basic right that everyone should have. So, the fact that the uninsurable are able to get coverage makes me happy. But then you have the people who are seeing their rates increase. Needless to say, they are upset about it, and rightfully so. But still, YOU GET INSURANCE. I cant imagine how it must feel to be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. The person that needs the medical coverage most didnt get it, while the people who didnt need it as much get it. Because of the cost of anything medical in this country, a single procedure is enough to crush you financially if you dont have insurance. Im trying not to pick sides here, but if I had to, I would prefer the ACA to the previous plan. But thats really not saying much. They are both pretty bad. If you bring up an argument about the websites functionality, let me stop you right here. The website is bad and everyone knows it. That is not the issue here. The first issue at hand should be to insure as many people as possible. Next, we should look at the price."

26920227803,I blame the ACA for taking my bare bones plan and plugging it full of shit so i can subsidize everyone else. Just more social justification of taking more of my money and giving it to someone who supposedly needs it more.
26920231945,"Insurance companies are sleazy and dollar-grubbing machines, but I blame the government just as much for not being able to create a system that functions properly. The insurance industry only operates under the rule and legislature of the American government; change will not happen if its left up to companies who are raking in such monstrous revenues every year. How could any reasonable person expect these companies to change and willingly accept anything that fundamentally changes the system when they are content to squeeze every dollar from the American consumer. Our government is tasked with regulating these industries to ensure that the majority of people are content with the system that it provides. Real change has to come from inside the government and needs to be enforced. I blame any politician who sits by the wayside and allows insurance companies to lobby and freely use their money to support a stagnancy within the system to prevent their inflowing cash to be diverted elsewhere. If you think that insurance companies have the desire or even the capacity to be socially responsible enterprises then you have another thing coming my friend. They want to make money. Thats it. The day an insurance provider proves me wrong will be a glorious day, and I will be happy to hear that I was wrong, but until that day comes we need the government to step in, grow a pair of balls, and govern insurance companies rather than bend over and take it. **TL:DR - Both parties are to blame**"
26920238178,Thanks Obama
26920248495,Are the editors at Foxnews.com asleep at their desks? How the fuck did they allow Juan Williams to post that?
26920249486,"New respect to Fox for publishing this, although it was written by Juan Williams..."
26920268836,"&gt;Essential health benefits must include items and services within at least the following 10 categories: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.¡± So as a non-drug-using, mentally healthy male, I have to now pay for pregnancy, newborn care, mental health disorders, drug use problems? So basically essential health benefits is a bullshit, arbitrary definition invented by the administration intended to make people like myself subsidize other peoples costs. **FUCK THAT.**"
26920281140,"The ACA doesnt really help anyone who was in trouble before the ACA. Im presuming that poor people who dont presently have insurance are going to go with a subsidized plan. All subsidized plans are 60/40 with a max $6500/year out of pocket. That means that the average poor family will still rack up $6500 in medical expenses. Even for a family scraping by on a $30,000/year income, a $6500 bill could bankrupt them, easily. May as well be a million, as far as Im concerned. So essentially, the only benefit I see from the ACA is that people who already have decent insurance cant be disqualified in the future due to pre-existing conditions. Whoop-de-freakin-do."

26920306585,hell has frozen over..... a well written non right article on fox news?!?!?1
26920314134,"A lot of those Obamacare requirement do NOT even apply to policies you had since March 2010. The only ones that apply to those grandfathered plans are: 1. waiting times 2. no recission 3. no lifetime caps, and 4. if it covers children, it has to till theyre 26. Those are de minimis. So this is just more GOP bullshit. Those cancellations were **completely voluntary** on the part of the insurers. And Obamacare couldnt stop it, because it doesnt even go into effect till 2014! "
26920318266,I thought we should blame the GOP? Now its the insurance companies? Im so confused!
26920322734,Fox News is telling me not to blame Obama. Have I missed sleep? Perhaps eaten brownies from the wrong bake sale? Is my computer infected with a virus?

Dont blame Obama, blame Hillary. Unsecured border letting who knows who to do who knows what into the country? Dont blame Obama, blame the border patrol and TSA. Honestly.

26920347992,Blame Yes. Blame. That surely makes sense because we all know every single problem in the world is always solely due to one cause or entity.
26920348382,"Am I in the twilight zone or did I just read that from Fox News? Honest question from someone who watches Fox; Are all of their contributors starting to take this attitude? Is this a lone effort from Juan Williams? Some of the better quotes: Taking crocodile tears to a new level, ObamaCare opponents are now rushing to their defense and calling the president a liar. Let me put it more bluntly: your insurance companies have been taking advantage of you and the Affordable Care Act puts in place consumer protection and tells them to stop abusing people. "
26920350583,How come not a single thing is ever Obamas fault? Im not a conservative but I honestly have never seen a president never be at fault or responsible for everything and anything. 
26920357421,Very surprised this article appeared on such an anti-Obama news corp. But then again seeing the change in OReillys way of presenting himself maybe I shouldnt be too surprised.

26920368969,"Nope, sorry Juan. People are losing their insurance because of Obama, Pelosi, Reid, and everyone else who voted for Obamacare...all Democrats. And shouldnt this be noted as an opinion piece?"
26920371118,"How incredibly stupid. Obama and the Democrats caused this mess and are 100% responsible for the outcome. How does one get so superior that they can decide what my insurance needs to be? Why do I, as a 56 year old man, need maternity and birth control coverage? When you interfere with the market, the market eventually wins. Anyone that voted for the man should be ashamed. "
26920588223,"(Ins coverage is that way to have the same policies offered to men and women. Obviously you dont use all of it. as for coverage they need this is a rightwing lie that ignores the whole concept of insurance.

26920371746,wtf.. foxnews? what the fuck just happened? 
26920372467,lol except of course Oblahblah and his BFF Billy Tauzin made it illegal NOT to buy their overpriced insurance
26920373154,Juan Williams wrote this? I thought he was a right wing pundit...
26920373640,"And before the trolls jump in to say how dare people on the individual market get any tax break (subsidy) for their insurance: Employees ALREADY get subsidised health insurance - no matter how much they earn. In the individual market, free lance workers, self employed, independent contractors and those between jobs only get a subsidy if they make under $28,000. But employees, even the rich ones earning $280,000 get a subsidy of up to 70% off, like Senator Cruzs wife who covers him with a policy that the government subsidises with a tax break given to Morgan Stanley to cut her costs to a third. Individual market people are finally not paying exorbitant prices. Now we get a subsidy too."
26920375113,"It is the fault of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). All the time the President was claiming that people could keep their coverage and their doctors, he knew he was lying. He still is lying. The President fully intended for people to lose their coverage. We have people with serious conditions such as stage IV cancer who have lost their policies and cannot get coverage. Those people are dying as a direct result of the intentional loss of their insurance due to Obamacare."
26920377939,If this law had never passed Id still have the insurance that I liked and could afford. Tell me again how this law is not at fault?

26920383516,"If the government states that the insurance companies can now only offer insurance plans that covers everything the government desires and nothing less while before these companies were offering a variety of products that people wanted and purchased but are now determined illegal or substandard by the government, how is this the insurance companies fault? Is the government going to come out and tell the life insurance companies they can now only offer $1,000,000 life insurance policies and any that they offer that are less than that amount are now determined to be substandard and must be terminated? I have seen numerous people interviewed who actually liked the plans they had before the implementation of Obamacare but can no longer receive these plans because the government has declared their plans illegal and these people are very upset. Why would a 55 year old woman pay for a plan that covers maternity costs? So the plan would be cheaper for women who want that coverage. Fair? No. That 55 year old woman is subsidizing the younger women, is she not? Why should she be required to do such a thing? When is the government going to declare that we may purchase only electric powered automobiles and have our current gasoline powered automobiles declared illegal? Same thing...no? Perhaps the government will provide a subsidy for me to purchase the most expensive $83,570 Tesla. I would need a $40,000 subsidy and several airline tickets each year to get me to get where I need to go where the Tesla will not take me. Fair?"
26920384929,CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE TOO
26920385166,"Serious question(s): I know a lot of private health insurance companies are canceling policies because they claim that they cant afford to pay for patients with pre-existing conditions.. But is there any other reason they no longer are keeping these policies? Also, are these companies at risk for bankruptcies considering that theyre losing a lot of customers? If so, why arent they trying to compete with the ACA exchanges and change their models? "
26920387820,"Its not their fault for offering cheaper plans with things that people didnt think they need. Now that they are forced to be offering them whether the consumer wants them or not is ACAs fault, not insurance."

26920422994,"Neither Obama nor the ACA did not address the fundamental problem with healthcare coverage and medical costs, and because it does nothing to solve the problem, its an empty gesture that does very little to help Americans, besides the ones who had nothing in the first place. Personally, if something becomes mandatory, its cost should be regulated. If your bill, named the Affordable Care Act does little to make helathcare affordable, it certainly sounds like its not working as it should. People scream about socialism like its a horrible evil thing, and unchecked, it is. But so is unchecked capitalism. They need each other to reach their full potential, and they need to be regulated to make sure they never tip the scales too far one way or another."

26920515826,"I am in the insurance industry. I have seen it all from insurance companies. I voted for ACA because I know what goes on inside and their immoral business ethics. I said then and will continue to say that before it gets better its going to be bad and we are going to deal with the nasty strategies insurance companies use and greedy doctors. Well, bring it on! This too shall pass when they realize that they can no longer continue to rape consumers. They had it good for too long by abusing the consumers with garbage plans, selective eligibility, tight underwriting guidelines and not to mention out of control rate increases. This is called legalized thievery in my book! When they see that their tactics are not working this time around and their membership and profits continue to go down, they will be forced to finally be real competitive and stop raping consumers. This is just a strategy to scare consumers and get back at Obama. Enough is enough! Welcome to true capitalism my friends!"
26920516441,"If you pay taxes to the federal government, and then the federal government uses part of that money to pay for state health care, which will cost 1.46 trillion in the next 10 years or $562 per year for everyone (or double for the 53% of Americans who actually pay income tax). Youre actaully paying two groups for one coverage. Then also factor in the fact that this will only exacerbate the debt crisis which will crash down on us in 10 years or less and basically reduce US dollars to pesos. In the long run Obamacare policies will cost a lot more than any private insurance. Affordable Care is just Obama and the rest of the Democratic Partys terribly implemented solution to bring affordable healthcare to the underclass(since they are the Democrats main voting base) If they really wanted to solve this problem without making 10 more they could push for more medicare and welfare reforms to improve the lower classess standard of living and get most of them working and out spending money frivolously to support the economy and therefore create MORE jobs so more are available. But of course most of that kind of problem-solving would take a long time and be harder to milk for political publicity. Easier to introduce one big controversial bill that solves all and then let the next sucker deal with the 12 epic fuckups it eventually creates. "
26920521753,is this a joke? please tell me this is a joke
26920521964,"Nope, sorry but the ACA is at fault. You cant demand compliance and expect compliance without purges. Companies want profit and will go towards maximizing that. When Obama pushed through a lot of credit card regulation bills the first thing my credit card companies did was cancel my cards, reduce my credit limits (most dropped to exactly what I currently owed), and jack up my interest rates. They did all this once it became clear this would become law but before it actually went into effect. I had some cards go from around 10% to over 30% despite never missing a payment. I was almost forced into bankruptcy due to the shock all this suddenly dealt to my credit score and ability to borrow."

26920626976,"Actuarial Science major here. Ill do my best to explain why insurance companies chose to drop so many policies. Insurance companies have to charge enough money per policy to cover their expected payouts in the event that an insured has a claim. What that means is that all the people who pay for car insurance and DONT get in an accident are essentially helping to pay for all the insureds that DO get in an accident. The same concept applies to health insurance. So, once the ACA went into play, insurance companies had to bring all their current insureds up to the standards put in place by the ACA. The article names a few very basic standards put in place, but I have no doubt there are many, many more standards that were not named (its a truly massive bill). It then became the job of the actuaries and the underwriters to set new prices for all the current insureds policies. The same price couldnt be charged, because the assumed risk, and expected payouts to insureds were not being covered by the current rates. Once the new rates were set, they had to evaluate all their current insureds policies, and figure out if they could even justify continuing to give them coverage at their current rate. The reason for so many dropped policies is that the insurance companies couldnt justify continuing their insureds policies at their set rate, and the insurance companies cant just suddenly charge them more money. Instead, the insurance companies sent out letters to the unfortunate former-insureds detailing what their current policy would cost them after the ACA came into play (note: usually, much more than what they were paying). This didnt have anything to do with insurance companies taking advantage of you, this had to do with a company simply not being able to offer more coverage for the same price. While having a really great health plan for a very low price would be wonderful, its simply not viable. TL;DR: insurance companies were forced to drop many insurance policies because it would cost them too much money to keep them. Insurance companies havent been taking you for granted, they have simply been offering the lowest price they possibly could for the coverage they were giving. Edit: Just to clarify, Im still a senior at college, not in a job setting yet (hopefully will be in December), and Im not claiming to know everything there is to know about insurance or the ACA. Im simply trying to offer some information about how insurance works, and why these policies might have been dropped."
26920632273,Hear hear
26920632464,"Im still trying to figure out the need for government run and mandated healthcare and insurance? Why didnt the Obama camp just come up with a tax break to cover health insurance based on income, or soemthing equally simple? All they had to do was pass a law that required all states to offer some form of low income health coverage and care and then a tax break for everyone else proportionate to income, family size and health--basically need! There would have been no need for this monsterous health care plan that has now turned into a HIPAA nightmare and insurance fiasco."
26920676050,I keep hearing and reading ObamaCARE is going to save people money and offer better coverage... when is the media going to start reporting Americans have purchased better healthcare coverage at cheaper price?

26898593065,"The real issue is people understanding (or not understanding) the difference between the annual budget deficit and the national debt. Theyre both words that start with de and mean youve spent more money than you took in. Our *deficit* is going down but our *debt* is still increasing. Many republicans (and some democrats) want us to start paying down the *debt*, which means we need a budget surplus, rather than a deficit.

Basically, US debt is financed through treasury securities. You get rid of US debt, and you get rid o treasury securities, considered one of the worlds lowest risk investment vehicles. "
26898818690,"Poor analogy. These sort of breezeovers drive me crazy. Look, as the dollar gets weaker AND the GDP gets larger, the debt will increase. Ill give you a better analogy. Imagine in 2000 you earned, say, $30,000, just as a good round #. You have $500 in credit card debt. Its not ideal, but its relatively low compared to the average person. Now, its 2013, and your career has progressed, with you making now $60,000. You have $650 in credit card debt. Oh my fucking God!! Debt is out of control! It keeps on going higher and higher... But wait, its actually lower than it was, based on your net wealth. And wait... due to depreciation of the dollar, its even LESS than that. Thats whats going on. The government deficit is going down AND the debt is going down in relationship to the GDP. Of course, this could all be easily solved by just bringing taxes up to the Clinton Levels (or God forbid, the 1950s, where wed have a glut surplus), dropping aid to most foreign countries who are self-sufficient or dont care about us, tax subsidies to oil companies, stripping down trillion dollar military programs they dont even want (e.g. tanks), etc, etc, but we couldnt possibly do that, could we? Sorry, I just had to post this before my eyes started bleeding. Too many utter fucking idiots use this as a rallying point when they dont get it right, thereby completely ignoring the vanishing middle class. If it wasnt Congress and Washington DC clamoring for this in their little BUBBLE, the real issue of jobs and lowering wages would be #1, which is what it is for main street, and has been for way too long.

Thats actually a terrible analogy: you can increase the absolute debt while decreasing the debt in a practical sense. Huh?, you might say -- but the real metric for looking at debt is debt *as a percentage of GDP*. [US debt grew for the entire decade of the 60s](http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/usgs_line.php?title=Gross%20Public%20Debt&amp;units=r&amp;size=l&amp;year=1960_1970&amp;sname=US&amp;bar=0&amp;stack=1&amp;col=c&amp;legend=&amp;source=a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a&amp;spending0=0.36_0.37_0.38_0.40_0.41_0.42_0.44_0.45_0.49_0.50_0.52), but debt as a percentage of GDP [shrank quite significantly](http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/usgs_line.php?title=Gross%20Public%20Debt&amp;units=p&amp;size=l&amp;year=1960_1970&amp;sname=US&amp;bar=0&amp;stack=1&amp;col=c&amp;legend=&amp;source=a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a&amp;spending0=68.48_67.49_65.52_64.00_61.53_58.66_55.29_54.55_53.84_50.72_50.51), by about 20 percentage points."
26898746622,"This analogy actually comes teasingly close to being good, but falls pretty flat. A better way to look at it, is deficit is the food you take in, debt is your weight. Your metabolism is your after inflation interest rate, and your muscle is the overall strength of the economy. Every persons health weight is different, and every person will gain weight at a different rate with the same food intake. A person who works out constantly, and flexes his muscles all over the place is going to have a really high metabolism (a SUPER low real interest rate, for the US, it is negative). In fact, the person NEEDS to eat more as they put on more muscle to keep up their activity level. Thats ok, because they keep putting on more muscle to offset the increased food intake. This is especially true when the person has been slacking and hasnt been working out hard. He needs his protein to build that muscle back up (stimulus spending) Sometimes, the person will get wasted a put on a ton of empty calories (wars, tax cuts that dont generate economic growth) and has to go on a diet to get down to a more ideal weight, but that doesnt mean he COMPLETELY stops eating, he just needs to keep working out so that his muscle gain can catch up to his weight gain. If the person lets his weight get too out of control, he gets lethargic and his joints start to hurt, and if it gets really out of control he can have a heart attack (like the world economy losing faith in the dollar) Obviously, no one is going to gain muscle forever (and some people would say you cant have strong GDP growth forever either) but so far the US has been able to keep its growth rate high enough that our debt has had minimal impact on our ability to increase growth. We had a few years of binge eating and our weight was starting to get out of control, but now we are getting back to a more reasonable food intake and we can get back to our previous workout schedule. "
26898742527,Except that running a deficit helps in keeping the economy healthy and running budget surplus can make it sick.
26898731866,Youre absolutely right. Its surprising how many people think we had zero debt after the Clinton presidency. They mistake the debt for deficit and somehow come to the conclusion that most of our 17 trillion dollars of debt accumulated while Bush was in office. Its not just the politically uninformed that confuse the two: [Heres a clip of **Jon Stewart** getting called out by Bill O Reiley for not understanding the difference between debt and deficit during their 2012 debate.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZTUW-9XB_M)
26898670390,"&gt; A comparable analogy would be an obese person gaining 15 pounds a year over the last 10 years, and then only gaining 9 pounds this year. Its still not good that theyre gaining weight, but its better than the alternative. For real health, they need to lose weight. Thats a very incomplete and misleading analogy. There wouldnt be anything particularly stupendous about paying off all of the sovereign debt. In fact, unless there are literally zero investment opportunities, not being in debt would mean that the government were stunting the economy. The only important thing is that we dont acquire so much debt that creditors begin to doubt our ability to pay it back, which would lead to higher interest rates, which would eventually lead to default and economic depression. The location of the threshold for too much is unknown, but is also roughly a factor of the GDP. One political party certainly thinks we are very close to that threshold, but there isnt really anyone but them making any noise about it, especially since the deficit has been decreasing lately. What the Tea Party fails to understand is that the true problem in the budget is not the short term deficits (which are falling and dont matter anyways), but the long term projected escalation in the cost of social programs such as social security. In order to pay for those, we will need more revenue, which means that the only thing that matters from a budget perspective is economic growth over the next 20-30 years. That is why it would really be better to accept a larger deficit now for the sake of increased investment. "
26898676118,Republicans want us to go an an anorexic crash diet. Tea Partiers want us to weigh 0 pounds.
26900417820,"Except when were talking the U.S. government, the annual income to the government is in the range of 2.5 trillion, and the debt is 6.5 times that."
26898680211,"A budget surplus? The hell you say, time to start cutting taxes!"
26899021079,"So what do you not understand about Bush being handed a surplus and then blowing it and then overseeing the financial crisis Greenspan said couldnt happen? Further, in order to reduce the debt you need to first reduce the deficit. Step 1 in progress. You cant just cut spending to the point where the debt goes down without balancing this with revenues and over time to deal with the financial crisis. What Republicans will say is, theyre approach to blocking everything is the reason the deficit is going down. But they are dead wrong, the lack of the ability for Obama to increase spending when it was needed to get people back to work has been blocked and increase revenues on the rich, this is costing us too much money in the long run and is counter productive to reducing the debt. In fact Republicans have and continue to do the opposite of being fiscally conservative."
26898648798,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_analogy http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/podcasts/critical_reasoning_for_beginners Weight and government income are not remotely analogous. Theres no magical Anti-weight like an increasing GDP, or income growth, or the ability to raise taxes. Its just a childish and incoherent way of trying to simply an economic issue into a kindergarten lecture."
26898747677,"&gt;Theres no magical Anti-weight like an increasing GDP Increasing height? &gt; the ability to raise taxes Exercise? But in all seriousness, the whole point was that something can continue to get worse while the rate at which it gets worse slows. Yes, there are other variables, and Id have to look at a shitton of economists opinions to determine at what rate the debt can increase without being harmful (but even liberal economists on NPR often say that were reaching a rubicon), but it is possible for the debt to increase at a slowing rate and for that to be a bad thing if the original rate was severe, and that was my point."
26898732195,"Except an increasing debt is actually a good thing, as long as it rises with inflation. It isnt and our debt is way to high, but its important to keep in mind that a high debt is a relative term. 0 debt means are currency is worthless. We want some kind of debt and it should theoretically be increasing at a small rate every yeast. But its not so we need to run a surplus for next few, if not many, years."

26810737375,Obamas statement was clearly 100% true. The Mostly true rating is just Politifact being ridiculous. I am guessing that this is Politifacts attempt to create a false right-left equivalence. See also http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/politifact-r-i-p/
26810778056,"Probably. They cant stand saying the left is 100% true without getting flak from the right. Look, if Obama screws up, then challenge him for what hes openly screwed up, like the NSA and the wikileaks-related trials and such. But the right cant stand him being right on anything."

By itself, the Presidents statement is correct, but he *is* invoking Reagan to tug at conservatives heartstrings and make them feel like theyre letting Reagans legacy down in some way. I am generally an Obama fan, but this isnt the first time he and the Democrats have implied false notions while remaining 100% factually correct. A great example was how they talked about birth control in the last election--they never *said* all Republicans want to take away birth control, but by saying Republicans want to limit a womans access to birth control they heavily implied it (and it was technically true as Republicans opposed the birth control mandate). As a result, a lot of female voters believed Republican mainstream candidates like Mitt Romney truly wanted to ban birth control for all women. Republicans do something similar when they imply Obama is not Christian. I dont think thats a false equivalency..."
26811280589,"It was rated mostly true because Obamas phrasing was designed to lead people to draw their own false conclusions. Obama could have said 30 years ago instead of when Reagan took office. Dragging Reagan into it leads people to draw false conclusions, e.g. Even super-conservative Ronald Reagan set higher minimum wages! Additionally, many people will come away from that speech mis- remembering the statistic as Minimum wage is lower now than it was **while Reagan held** office, and that isnt necessarily true. Its like when Mitt Romney challenged Obamas military strategy by pointing out that we have fewer ships (and Obama famously rebuked we also have fewer horses and bayonets). Romneys statement was factually accurate, but it was phrased to lead the audience to draw false conclusions. Politicians are *very* good at doing that."

Heaven forbid someone posts a survey showing blacks in a positive light. One redditor suggests that the problem is because the site is called good black news. So what? Look at the freaking sources. You cant criticize a website just because of its name. They pulled this article from the LA Times. GASP! And where did they get this information? The National Center for Health Statistics. Oh my! The other redditors suggest that the article was mistaken for not including fathers who were not with their children at home. Uh. Yes they did. And I quote: &gt;Nearly half of black fathers living apart from their young children said they played with them at least several times a week, 42% said they fed or ate with them that frequently, and 41% said they bathed, diapered or helped dress them as often  rates on par with or higher than those of other men living apart from their kids. It also says: &gt;Although the survey showed that black fathers not living at home are as involved with their children as fathers of other races in similar situations, the higher percentage of black dads absent from the home could drag down the average involvement for all black fathers, other researchers pointed out And it also went on to talked about fathers in a different relationship &gt;However, Laura Tach and fellow researchers also found that black fathers were more likely than white or Latino dads to stay close to their children after having more kids with a new partner. Because it isnt as rare for black fathers to live away from the home Really Reddit? Every single damn time. You assume the worst in blacks. This article must surely be a fluff piece. These pro-black journalists must surely have left out blacks away from home (Hehe. Therefore the stereotype is still true in my racist mind). Surely something must be wrong with this article if it makes an assumption that makes the black community look goo"

I think the stereotype mainly has to do with black fathers who dont live with their children and dont have much to do with them at all. &gt;According to 2011 U.S. Census Bureau data, over 24 million children live apart from their biological fathers. That is 1 out of every 3 (33%) children in America. Nearly 2 in 3 (64%) African American children live in father-absent homes. One in three (34%) Hispanic children, and 1 in 4 (25%) white children live in father-absent homes.

"
26804987801,"Seriously, downvote me if you want, but I dont even think Im going to vote anymore. Whats the point? Our system is so corrupt there is no turning back. Obama did a complete 180 on everything he promised. Id anyone thinks the powers will be reigned in, you have more hope then what I do. There is so much money now invested in the Utah center, and new centers being built, and promises made in those endeavors, I have to wonder what kind of dirt is being held over the heads of our politicians and congress. The only one that comes to mind that wants any kind of change and has stuck his neck out is Wyden. Hes my hero. Im from an older generation, when we actually went outside and protested and made change. Put technology into the mix, and all that has changed. I use to think our petitions helped. They dont. I use to get mad at people when I couldnt get them to sign petitions. Often hearing whats the point? It made my blood boil. When I would hear people say I dont vote, whats the point I would reply with if you dont vote you have no right to bitch, get out and vote. And now, Im becoming one of those very people. If anyone wants to watch a really good video of a speech Ron Paul gave, this is worth a watch, oldie, but couldnt be more true: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjuUWr9vaXo Simply titled: What If Only person I would vote for at this point would be Ron Paul. Other than that, I WILL throw my vote, or just not vote at all. Id rather not vote then vote for outright corruption. And all you haters can hate. Im only saying what some wont admit."

26804999771,"I really think the only way America can make changes is by resorting to violence - kind of like how their government gets stuff done. Now dont get me wrong, I am not promoting any kind of violence. But when the population is passive and peaceful, the government doesnt listen - as we can see. Americans have been very respectful with how they have been protesting against what they do not like about their government. And the government continues to ignore them and ignore their own basic rights. Countries that have gotten so fed up with their government resort to violence to change, such as civil wars. I believe the American government is only going to think about changing how they operate if its own citizens launched some kind of civil war against the government. Because Americans can protest peacefully as much as they want but their government will never listen. Imagine if the American civil war was instead protest after protest. Nothing would have been accomplished. As sad as it sounds, it seems thats how our world works."
26805000055,"Since http://www.whitehouse.gov/ is now the link givin on change.gov I left an online comment asking why obama has changed his stance on protecting whistileblowers. You should do the same, make sure to post his promise- Protect Whistleblowers: Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process. "

26805050073,"To be fair -- and Im not protecting the removal from the site -- the idea of whistle-blowing wasnt meant to be what Snowden did. Traditional whistle-blowing means taking it to the proper administrative channels to blow the whistle on a governmental unit -- not leaking it to the press for a huge shit storm. Snowden probably wouldnt get far with that, and that may be a problem, but lets not pretend that Obama -- or any President -- would support and protect this type of whistle-blowing."

26805065909,"Hopefully this will get buried but I absolutely hate how people are reacting to this issue. Yes, the US violated our rights, yes something should be done about it. Snowden knew what he was doing when he blew that whistle, he knew he would be deemed a traitor and rightfully so because. . .well he is one. He needs to be brought back tot he US so we can demonstrate we know how to deal with people like this in a humane manner. The only reason Russia is doing what they are doing is because it will make us look worse if we cant get him back on US soil and deal with him in a democratic fashion and make this go away. Our image is being soiled and the ignorant American populous are the catalysts. "

For the next election, let us ALL do our research and vote for those who come from humble backgrounds, have real and viable plans, and would make sense for this country. Avoid strictly Democrats and Republicans if possible. It is time to end the two-party system in the United States of America and convert it into an all-party system by voting for the humble politicians with fresh, viable and progressive ideas.

I get $200 a month for my wife and I, I have been a Dry grocery associate for this time.. I have some grief to share, and also some suggestions on how to survive being a wal-mart associate. My grievances: 1.) Management focusing on pety stuff- For instance; When I was evaluated I was not given a raise. This was at my one year mark, I make 8.10 an hour and I work my ass off. I did not receive a raise, because I had One write up for working over 6 hours (Thats right folks, trying to help out and be a good worker) and my attendance (I currently have 2 absent days) 2.) Not truely being customer oriented; I am consistently harassed by management to perform (Move freight weight, they could care less about the customers) They see you helping a customer, automatically assuming your standing around talking, or when you are walking to check something for them, youre automatically put on the shit list for not working. Its absurd. 3.) Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. I will have more people telling me what to do then I can count, and they wonder why xy and z is not done. 4.) Asking you to do a job that the wage is higher than what you make; Odds are, you will be sent to do someone elses job. Odds are, they get paid more than you; 5.) They are not in the business of human progression; rather profit over people. Remember that its just a walmart, if you work there. Try your best, but dont let them take advantage (They are in the business of taking advantage!!) Guide for surviving as a wal-mart associate 1.) Remember, its a walmart. 2.) Treat your customers with compassion, and empathy. Put yourself in there shoes, and remember there negativity isnt directed at you; even if it seems that way. Treat them almost as if they were your family; after all, we are all human beings on the same planet. 3.) Dont be late/call in unless you cannot control it. Punctuality is everything. 4.) Try your best to communicate the situations that you need assistance on. Otherwise, management cant help you. 5.) When people are trying to pass you, let them pass. Youre getting paid, be courteous, even if you have a time limit. 6.) Regardless of what your doing, always approach a customer and ask if they need assistance. It will pass time and create a positive environment, and they will tell management. Management hears bitching all day, so to hear something good, is truely meaningful. 7.) Invest in a higher education while youre employed at wal-mart 8.) Use your time you must work to learn about people; and to handle conflicts. I try to be the best human being I possibly can be while working at walmart. Management can get under your skin, but remember they are just human too, and probably not as content as you are.

Surely, if that were the case, it would be reported by more than a union-backed study, right? I mean, really, every single worker at every single store on welfare? That IS what the article says, guys. They specifically arrived at their figures by first assuming that every single person at every single store that works for Walmart is on public assistance. No matter how much you hate Wally World, even the mildest application of common sense must show that to be complete horsecrap. Of course, now Ill get a parade of downvotes, and accusations that Im trying to argue that Walmart pays its workers in thousand-pound chunks of pure gold, or some such nonsense, but that doesnt actually make me wrong.

They lie, cheat and steal every day. But I have only seen this in the last 3 or so years, it has changed... Im in Philly Pa area. Ive seen store managers change times in associates worked hours, Ive seen store and shift managers change associate passwords to do their cbls or delete cbls so they stayed off regional lists, Ive watched store, shift and market asset protection managers hold associates accountable for making mistakes... Using the deleted or store manager completed cbls as proof of training ( associates didnt know their cbls were completed) Ive seen store, shift, market and other assistant managers refuse associates ability to report accidents (one was a broken arm) Ive seen said managers pad inventory, throw away merchandise and take rounded off markdowns instead of prepping merchandise for inventory, Ive seen sexual harassment, discrimination of race and gender, Ive seen schedules changed with no notice, hours cut to save bonuses etc. I reported a long list of things about 3 years ago to a market asset protection manager I thought I could trust to do something. Turns out she was signing reports without reading them and allowing these things to occur because she couldnt afford another store to shrink. So instead of doing the right thing they spent 3 years trying to fire me.. They threw me on 3rd. My boss would give me notes then call me and change verbally so it wasnt in writing. He would tell me to do unethical things like assign tasks to myself and complete them in the system to make it look like we had enough associates to home office, hed tell me to basically erase our ims ( picks) instead if wasting time to pull them to keep scores up, or schedule people in job codes they werent going to work (different pay scales) just to make it look like we had associates to HO. When I refused they would look for things they could coach me on since they obliviously couldnt coach me fit the true things. I had a baby and my store, market hr and market manger kept talking to me about bring a stat at home mom, told me anything over my scheduled hours was volunteer work (pa law says if youre salary but strictly in a role of supervising people which was my role you are to be paid overtime). This used to be the greatest company. I called it the best kept secret because I was making extremely good money and my job wasnt hard... That is until they decided the illegal way was much more profitable and exploiting the associates who NEED their jobs. "

26743938970,"I have been saying this for years. I think any company that employs someone for 20+ hours per week and doesnt pay them enough to live on should have to pay taxes equal to 110% of the government assistance that person receives in Food Stamps, WIC, Welfare, and Medicaid. This way the price is reflected in the price of the goods, rather than our taxes."
26743580545,"My daughter worked for Wal Mart for almost 6 months. She was always scheduled to work 30 hrs or less per week. After she had worked there for a while ( couple of months) the pressure to stay late and donate her time because they were busy happened almost every day. After she refused a few times, a supervisor had the talk with her. If she wanted to become an associate, if she wanted to continue working there, if she wanted to be part of the team she needed to start acting like she wanted to work there. It must be corporate policy to treat the workers like that. And, that is why I have not set foot in a Wal Mart for 15 years and will never do so again."

Problems detailed in the film: employees reliance on public assistance, forced unpaid overtime, skeleton crews, environmental hazards, the forced closure of longstanding local businesses, an anti-union stance, cameras to spy on employees, part-time hours, lack of security on Wal-mart grounds, and deplorable conditions in oversea factories."

They dont let people work more than that usually because they would be forced to pay them benefits. I make 7.90 an hour. We are told we will get bonuses 2-4 times a year, but each time that has happened there is always something that comes up that takes it away. If a customer decides to lie and say they were hurt in our store, our bonus is gone. The highest bonus that Ive been given is $70, when usually they say it will be around $400. My monthly income is about $700-800 dollars. That isnt enough to afford an apartment/food/basic necessities (tp,soap,personal hygiene stuff, etc). Because of that, I was forced to get on foodstamps to be able to afford to eat. I tried getting on medicaid for health insurance too, as I suffer from ADHD that makes it difficult to function day to day without my meds. Of course I was denied because I wasnt stupid enough to have a kid at my age. Ive been off my meds for about a year and ever day is a nightmare. My town is also too small to have any free clinics or anything, so that is out of the question. Eventually I gave up on trying. I live in my car now and still work for walmart. Im hoping this will let me save up enough money to move somewhere with better job opportunities, but Im really at a dead end. I dread going to work and having to put on a facade that Im happy working for such a great corporation as walmart, but if people knew the shit that goes on behind the scenes, they would be appalled to give walmart their money. Oh, and when you are hired on and havent worked there for more than six months, you dont get ANY bonuses or any time and a half pay for working holidays. Also, we dont have vacation time or anything like that. In fact, I was just talking to a coworker who was denied both of their childrens birthdays off, even though they asked 3 months in advance."
26743574802,It seems to me that they are exploiting a hole in our social safety net. I like to focus on things other than the minimum wage but this is a weird situation that needs fixing. What is actually happening here is that welfare is putting downward pressure on peoples reservation wage. Since people are receiving government money for making so little income but still working then it lowers their reservation wage. Minimum wage should be raised to the point where someone working at it for some reasonable amount of hours (75% fulltime) would not need/qualify for welfare. edit: Damn the incentives going on here are super interesting.

26743581887,It is not Walmarts fault. They are within the law. Raise minimum wage for large companies if you want to see things change.
26743582097,"Wally world is a bad company by anyones standards but they are not the only ones. If you live in a right to work state and you go to a restaurant, the wait staff are making $2.15/hr if they are lucky. Since most people dont realize this they dont tip very well, add the wonderful economy and you have a whole industry that employs people who cannot make minimum wage. The employer is required to cover the balance yes, but that is just to get them to minimum wage if they dont on tips. Then you add the Obamacare mandate and a lot of these places are cutting back shifts to keep hours below the minimum requirement.

These wages are not designed to support kids and a family. They are designed to pay for a high school kids car, or tuition at a community college, or to fill in the gaps for a family whose children have to work. Just because you have no other skills and are incapable of getting other work does not mean that walmart should be required to pay for all 10 of your irresponsible fucks."

Contrast that to costco workers who are actually trying, seem motivated, and look like they actually give a shit about their job and dont just mope around until their shift is done."

26743606838,"When did it become necessary for a corporation to be held morally accountable for their employees well being when they are already complying with labor laws? The corporation and not the government decides the value of their employees and compensates them accordingly. In retail and other high turnover employers such as fast food that means minimum wage, mainly part time employment, and not much discernible career growth. If you have no real skills then unfortunately you might have to work 2 or 3 part time jobs to cobble together enough to get by. Some of us have had to work both a full time and a part time job just to make ends meet and it eventually led to better things because you can be rewarded for being ambitious. One last thing: stop having children if youre not able to support them. I seriously cannot emphasize that enough because your personal choices have absolutely zero bearing on how much money you deserve to earn!"
26743607600,"Here is my insider opinion. I started working at Walmart (and yes, it is no longer Wal-Mart, just Walmart) when I was 16 as a cashier. I still work there 3 years later as a sales associate in the summer while I go to school the rest of the year. I am not bothered by the fact that most people here work at close to minimum wage. The simple fact is that we work unskilled jobs and should not be payed more. I make about $9 an hour now, and I get a quarterly bonus of about $250 before taxes, which is a lot more then I could at a comparable job at a grocery store. I get scheduled to work 30-33 hours a week, but they allow me to work unfilled shifts, so I actually work 37-40 hours a week. Walmart has recently vowed to be more transparent with employees about open shifts that we can ask to work, and they are always happy to allow me to work more. The bottom line is that Walmart workers are payed poorly because anyone with a middle school education can work these jobs. Also, I have never been treated poorly or unfairly, and I work at a smallish Walmart in an Upper-middle class suburb, so not that many crazies shop at my store."
26743609055,Restaurants relies on customers to footing the bill for workers that are essentially in the poverty ranks and working at that wage.

26743614352,"Why would anyone expect to be able to have a secure life let alone support a family while working *at a fucking grocery store??* These are jobs for teenagers and college kids, not fucking adults with children and a house payment... How much do you think a fucking cashier or someone who stocks items on shelves *should* make? It isnt skilled labor, it isnt hard, literally anyone who isnt physically disabled and not severely mentally disabled could do it, so why in the fuck *would* wages be anything that someone could support themselves comfortably on?"
26743616046,"Someone else posted somewhere this question, and I want to see a true answer. So for all the teenage cart pushers, newly hired cashiers, and stockmen, how much do you THINK they should be earning? Just because a place hires associates doing minimal skill jobs and paying them just above minimum wage does not make them evil. Its common sense. And we dont know each associates story. Walmart may have been their last chance for a job, when no other company would hire them. Yes, they start at the bottom, but do you think a cashier should be making $20 an hour with a full time position right at the get go? What if that cashier remains a cashier for 10 years, without any personal motivation to move up in the company? Should they be making the same amount as a manager with goals of moving up? Ill tell you my quick story. I have worked at Walmart since I was 18. I worked their for 2 years but I quit, because I was unhappy with my job. Management was shit and wasnt happy about it. I got hired at Circuit City but was there when that shut down. Went about 2 months of being unemployed, applying like crazy to every retail place I could apply for. No one was hiring, or wanted to hire. Applied for unemployment, was DENIED because I was going to school, to better myself. I reapplied to Walmart as a last resort, and not even a week later they hired me back. And even though they put me in the furniture department, they paid me about a $1 more than the minimum wage. I was excited. But, over the next 2 years I was unhappy because management was treating me unfairly. So instead of quitting again, I transfered to a different store. That last manager was quickly demoted about a few months after I left, and I found an opportunity in the optics department. I went from being a garden associate to an optician without any prior training, because I wanted to better myself in the company. I even got one of my optical licenses, which bumped my pay about $5. One of Walmarts rules is that you have to be employed for over 2 years as a part time associate before they give you benefits. I pay less than $15 for my health insurance each paycheck, and my copay is less than $10 for any medical expenses. I make a decent wage, and I have been happy with the company. But I strived to be a better associate, and to better myself, because I wanted MORE pay and MORE benefits. So I ask you again, how much should a cashier with no prior training and no motivation to move up in the world, or someone doing a base skill job, how much should they be getting paid? "
26743618222,Completely agree- end all taxpayers subsidies now. That will show those evil Walmart fat cats. 
26743618345,every penny paid in government assistance to employees ask a result of low wages shouldn be taken back out of the companies profits at the end of the year.

26743621266,"The title makes it seem like Wal-Mart is using tax payer money to pay their employees.

As someone who worked at minimum wage jobs and had friends who also worked at minimum wage jobs (including Walmart), they all do the same shit. We all complained about the same things and you wouldnt know we all worked at different places until we told you. I dont know anyone working for minimum wage (or close to it) in America that is satisfied with their working conditions and company policies. This isnt a Walmart problem, its much bigger than that. "

26743626383,"Im a bit surprised at the reaction to this on here. I dont think Walmart is evil or anything, just trying to make some money, but you can certainly make the argument that they are largely to blame for local business going away and causing manufacturing to largely leave the US and go over seas so they can offer cheaper prices. Those 2 types of middle class jobs dont really exist anymore in the US and used to be big middle class jobs. Working at Walmart/fastfood etc... is the only work available to many people right now so if you have a family to support you might have no choice but to work there. "

26743630689,"A company is responsible for maximising shareholders returns, and with the amount of unemployment in the US and the type of unskilled labour that Walmart is after, there is no incentive for them to pay their employees more than they have to. Its the same with taxes; the publicly listed companies cannot be expected to turn up to the AGM and tell their investors that they decided to write a bigger tax cheque to the government than they had to, rather than use everything possible to minimise it. You need to fix the system through regulation. tl;dr: Dont hate the player, hate the game."
26743631128,"And it gets better, with all that cost savings they get to offer lower prices to the taxpayers. And if they didnt, K Mart would. You gotta love competition."

There are several towns where Wal-mart is the only place that you can buy a needed item or buy your groceries in one trip. My uncle lives in a small NM mining town where a Wal-mart came along a few years ago and put several smaller local stores out of business. Now everyone in this town does the bulk of their shopping at Wal-mart. Its easy to sit on your suburban perch and say people should shop ethically, but in a tiny, isolated town where most people are not highly educated, seeking out Wal-mart alternatives is not going to be on these peoples radar. Its not realistic or fair to put the onus on them. "

My girlfriend and I have worked at 2 stores, and a couple friends have worked at a couple other stores and we all enjoyed it. The managers are friendly and accommodating, always trying to help you learn and make sure you are working the hours you want to. Further, they do an incredible amount for charity, locally, provincially and nationally. Hell, Im watching the BC childrens hospital telethon and just watched my old boss give a giant $900,000 cheque as well as organizing a huge walk for them in Vancouver. Yes they pay low wages to the entry level and lower management positions, but they will really push you to advance if you show the initiative and have good work ethic. I worked there for 5 years, mostly while in high school and was told if I didnt want to go off to University my manager would put my name in to get trained as an assistant manager starting at $50-$55k/year (at 21 years old with just a high school education). I see so much hate for Wal Mart, but their Canadian side is actually a very good company. "

Damaged packaging, and some times products, are to remain on the sales floor, and its rather impossible to move up in positions unless you kiss the right asses. The starting pay wasnt too abominable, nor was it impressive, but certain nothing sustainable.

26743710323,"Whats really going on here is that Walmart is paying these people market rate wages, and the government is subsidizing them with money from people who get paid more because they produce more economic value. This is possible only because there are enough people producing more economic value. Ignoring for now the merits of doing that, thats whats going on here. If the US were a third-world country that did not have people producing enough economic value for the government to redistribute, this would not be possible. Now, if you believe these people should be subsidized, isnt this the fair way to do it? The alternative is raising the minimum wage, forcing companies like Walmart to either pay their employees more than they would be otherwise worth, or to not hire them at all, letting them receive *all* their income from the government. This obviously screws over workers who dont produce much value, since theres no point in employing someone who provides less value than youre legally required to pay them. You might say, ¡°Walmart really needs cashiers and people to stock shelves, and they can afford to pay them more than they are,¡± but if it costs too much for Walmart to pay cashiers, they can install shitty, user-hostile automated checkout systems instead, and if the minimum wage to hire people to stock shelves is too high, they can limit themselves to hiring people who are productive enough to make up the difference, again screwing over less-productive workers. Interestingly, many people who are not on government assistance, and are paying taxes, are still being subsidized by more productive people overall. The Heritage Foundati"

This hasnt changed in 10 years. "
26743711181,"But its fine because it works and Americans seem *perfectly fine* with being the stooges who end up with the burden of making sure these people can still exist even though most work 40 hours per week and cannot keep their heads above water.

26743712170,"Taxpayers: Vote. Vote every time you are able. Vote for the individuals who represent you and your beliefs. Vote because we were given that right by the individuals who died for us to have that right. I read this post and can empathize for the individuals abused by corporations. However - the responsibility falls on the american taxpayers, consumers, and voters. Cooperatively, we have the ability to coerce change; however, individually one voice is futile. As far as Wal Mart - we can stop shopping there. We can choose to collectively pay more for goods that we use on a daily basis so that individuals employed are paid a decent wage; or, we can expect to pay as little as possible and maintain current standards. The thing is that as Americans, we want it all. We want the stock markets to continue to climb, the standard of life to rise for all, and the rights of all to be equal. However, collectively we are not willing to take a stand to make these things equal. We are not collectively willing to pay more, sacrifice more, and agree to work together to be better. Sorry to rant, but this is a revolving issue that overwhelmingly goes against the big guy (i.e. walmart) and is less considerate of the bigger problem(s). "

Not everyone can operator a register, unload products off a truck, and push carts together. Furthermore, Wal-Mart employees are forced to work there. They dont have the option of quitting or going elsewhere for better pay. Heck, even before Wal-Mart, the company forced its employees into making bad decisions, made them sign a contract which prevented them of having ambition, drive, or the will to succeed. How dear a corporation pay people market wages! Companies should not be allowed to earn profits - they should have to return this money back to the less fortunate. If Wal-Mart workers were paid $20.00/hr, their productivity would undoubtedly rise; thus, earning more money for Wal-Mart.

Customers think that they save money shopping at Walmart, but with how much they cost the taxpayers by having so much of its employers on government assistance, I believe that everybody (except Walmart) ends up loosing. Last year in our store they cut hours for everyone including its full timers (which there are less and less of them every year) so much, that they had the number of the citys unemployment office next to the time clock with instructions advising the full timers that they may be eligible to collect some unemployment, because their hours had drop so much. We also have a couple of paid holidays that we get time-and-a-half, but what they do to screw us of that extra money is that they schedule us a day less for that week, so we end up losing money in the end.

Last two nights of work there shortly after that were a call in and an ncns. Worst mother fuckin company I have ever worked for. Dont shop there anymore either, Feelsgoodman.jpg. I now work at a grocery store. A baby step up while Im in school, but honestly fml. "
26743794784,"As a Walmart associate ill say its not the best company to work fir but Ive worked at worse. To all those with terrible stories about management. I suggest you use the open door policy which allows you to go as high in the company as you want with a problem. In my personal experience the regional hr manager overturned a coaching. While it might not be the best place for everyone, to pretend they are the only company to use these practices and pay these wages is ridiculous . Even meijers which is unionized doesnt pay more than Walmart. Obviously the union isnt doing them any good. I also would like to point out that this article and others like it like to make it seem like most the associates are striking or want a union. The wording is misleading as if this were the case something would have changed. Your gonna need more than a few hundred people. "

26743802280,I dont get why it is the employers responsibility to provide benefits in the first place. Part of me thinks it might be better if it were the other way around; employers *cannot* be involved in peoples healthcare or retirement decisions.
26743802302,"Trickle down, in effect."
26743802753,lol THIS is news? More like old news. They whole Wal-Mart/Fast-Food industry is full of shitty jobs. I used to work at KFC. I made $7.25/hr and worked 20-35 hours a week. The schedule was determined weekly (so I had to plan my weeks around when my boss says I work) and most weeks it was out late or right at the deadline (last shift of the old schedule). If you start requesting to many days off a week then youd get a reduction in hours. Even if I only work four days a week and request that two specific days (instead of whenever my boos feels like) are my days off I would get reduced to 3 days for a few weeks. Whats worse is that these jobs are dead end. Fastfood managers make like $9 an hour and that is the cap unless they are really good or have connections. That is insane. $9?? I work in a factory now and the operators that dont even have a high school education make $17-18 an hour! DOUBLE! Regardless I dont see how this is news. Its just a fact that jobs like this are dead end and shitty.

26743831791,the math used is bullshit
26743832693,"I dont get it. Walmart is one of the most hated companies in America; both for their use of Chinese products (I understand, but have not been able to verify, that they use several Chinese perishable products such as mayonnaise that are made according to no particular regulations and shipped over here in 500-gallon bags for packaging so they can say Packaged in America), southeast asian sweatshop labor and their shitty treatment of employees. So why is it that every year their profits (and customers) grow and grow? People in America need to realize that **WE** have the power to change companies bad behavior, but **we only have the power to do so as an organized boycott**. Companies speak one language; Money. Anything that makes them start losing money will get attention. Anything that has *no* effect on their revenue or net profit will get **NO** attention. I used to work for Walmart. Back in 2007 ago they hired me as an unloader. Id never been paid so poorly in my life $8.35 for working in the elements (There was a roof over my head but on bone-chilling days, we felt it. On sweltering days we REALLY felt it. We just didnt get precipitation.) with absolutely no overtime (I once got sent home, I shit you not, 2 minutes early to kill overtime.) and terrible benefits. I only stayed because I needed the job, but every minute of my free time was spent looking for a new job. It took 4 months but I found one. A manufacturer of precision optics was hiring and **MAN** did I keep on them about getting me an interview. Turns out that while I had almost none of the skills and prerequisites they wanted, and they had a line of applicants straight out the door, they liked my drive enough to bring me on, but not for the job that was advertised. Instead, I became an optical machinists apprentice and they taught me everything I needed to make precision optical lenses. They also paid for my education in full and now I happily hold a masters degree in optical engineering and have been working for the same company ever since. So, happy ending for me! In all that time, though, Ive never forgiven Walmart for the way they treated me. I havent shopped there since. I drive 2 extra miles to go to Target. I pay the extra cash to get prescriptions filled at CVS and everything else I just order off Amazon and wait for it to arrive. By my estimates, their mistreating me has cost them about $10,000 (at least) over the last 5 years. Sure thats not even pocket change to them, but its plenty to me, and if more people felt that way, it would cost them a LOT more money. I hate Walmart with a burning passion and flat REFUSE to shop there even if Im desperate for something that only they have in stock. I only wish more people did. If the average person spends $100/week at Walmart (I think thats reasonable since many people do grocery shopping there.) and we got 100,000 people in this country to stop shopping there, Walmart would lose $520 million a year in revenue. That doesnt sound like a lot considering their revenue is well over $400 billion a year, but their margins are very slim. A drop in net profit from $17 billion to $16.48 billion would get noticed. They might shrug it off, but theyd notice. In addition, if their low level employees (I know department managers and store managers are quite happy with their jobs, even though they are still underpaid by industry comparison) stopped putting up with Walmarts bullshit and demanded better treatment or theyd quit.. that would get noticed too. Right now Walmart holds all the cards. The American people care more about the price tags on the shelves than the way Walmart treats their fellow Americans. And the Walmart employees are stuck in a self-defeating rut of I cant find a better job and Im stuck here. The government should do something! Im a firm believer that any time someone says there should be a law, there almost certainly should NOT be a law. There are many unintended consequences that arise when legislation gets enacted and one of the worst comes with the minimum wage. Yes, Im sorry to burst my fellow lefties and centrists conceptions about the minimum wage but it has been shown time and again that minimum wage hikes accelerate inflation; completely erasing any gains that were made with the hike. Whats more, hiking the min wage again (to stay ahead of inflation) might keep times good for a while (Like the 60s), but down the line it will make things very very bad (Like the 70s) and just wind up kicking a snowball downhill until its the size of a mountain. The only ones that have the pure power to stop companies like Walmart from being dicks are the consumers. Everything (And I do mean **EVERYTHING**) in this economy begins and ends with us. If we want Walmart to stop being assholes to their employees, **we need to stop paying them to do exactly that**."
26743835839,"Moral of this story is... DONT BUY THE SHIT THEY SELL AT WALMART!!!! Dont even go into one of them. Kmart and Sears still exist, and when they were #1 they both used to pay their employees, give the benefits AND profit sharing plans... Fuck Walmart!"

26743839546,"I love how Americans say increasing wages will destroy your economy, well guess what your economy is already destroyed due to low wages. If other countries can afford health care, increased benefits, happier, and a higher standard of living, ie Canada, Australia, All the Scandinavian countries; why can USA not have the same things?"
26743847447,"I slept overnight at a wal mart for 2 nights to eBay a new ps3. They let me and my buddy sleep in the layaway/site to store area. The manager wheeled out a TV with some DVDs for us to watch. It was much better than sleeping outside a best buy, but the wal mart cheer was unsettling. I shop there weekly (well my wife does) and we are satisfied with the store."
26743857727,Another way this could be written: Taxpayers rely on Walmart to subsidize public assistance
26743860894,"I think what we all have to realize is that they are still within their legal rights to operate their business on a such a manner. That being said, its up to the 300 Million of us to actively participate in our pseudo-Democratic system and elect the right people, fight for regulations and laws and be a part of changing things for the better. Yes its hard with so many lobbyists running things but we have the power to vote people out of office and elect the right officials. Start local and build up. It starts with the man in the mirror.

Im not saying that Walmart is right for having policies like this, but it is obvious that Democrats are only making this argument for two reasons. 1 - They hate Walmart, and will do anything to force them to lose money. 2 - They want higher minimum wages across the board, because they believe that it will lead to greater prosperity for the populace. What they forget is the fact that if the wages have to be raised, it means innumerable companies, Walmart included, will have to raise prices to compensate. That same Walmart supercenter, assuming 300 people working 25 hours per week, making $10.10 an hour instead of $7.25 means $1,111,500 per year in lost revenue. This **will** be passed on to the consumers. The very same consumers that are also working at the Walmart. And that is only the short term effects."
26743875918,Wal-Mart to Middle-Class America: F U
26743879274,Just know that all the horror stories you hear about WalMart also hold true to Target. Target just has a better PR team.
26743881035,Walmart is the fucking devil 
26743885489,Isnt this old news? I thought this was brought up late last year? 
26743885938,"The fact is that if Walmart raised wages and paid benefits as many of you in this thread think they should do, they would also have to decrease their labor force substantially. So, although a significant amount of Walmart employees would be lifted above the poverty line, many many more would be condemned to it. Is this really a better solution?"
26743886087,"If they raise there prices then those like me not living the high life but getting by will suffer. Its a stock company they answer to stock owners who want (rightly) to see a return on their investment. What do we do with our unskilled labor force, if they have to pay better wages and provide health insurance then all the teenagers, older unskilled workers will be bump out of a job, lets be honest if you had the skills to work somewhere else at a better rate you would. If you qualify for food stamps you most likely qualify for a pell grant and day care assistance, take advantage and get out. Not trying to be mean just curious what reddit readers think is a good fix for this? I wish I would have taken advantage when I was young. I have a hard physical job, I just put in enough years where I can pay the bills. "
26743886682,Its not just Walmart. I believe that this idea has a lot to do with the low accepted pay rates and the relatively higher cost of living.
26743887854,So either stop subsidizing them or quit whining.
26743887983,"It is extremely disingenuous for this sub to constantly present the issue of wages for unskilled labor as a Walmart issue. Many other businesses that rely on unskilled labor use the same exact business practices, but nobody bats an eye because they dont profit nearly as much. Believe it or not, wages are not determined by profit, and constantly pointing the finger at Walmart for not paying higher wages because they can only demonstrates the ignorance many in this sub have concerning the issue and economics in general."
26743889047,"Walmart may treat its employees horribly, but government subsidization of people lowly skilled people doing simple jobs is better than government subsidization of lowly skilled people without jobs. What would happen if the minimum wage was raised? Walmart would figure out how to do the same thing with less employees and these same people wouldnt doing anything. What pisses me off a lot more is that there are plenty of assholes making twice as much working at Trader Joes when there are so many nice people who work at Walmart. Those fuckers at Trader Joes even switch their name tags around all of the time so you cant even complain about them."
26743891973,"If youve never seen the documentary Walmart: the high cost of low price you need to. Wal-Marta douchbaggery is no new story. The film was made in 2005 and talks about wal-mart tactics using many shady practices, and encouraging its employees to use federal assistance instead of offering fair benefits. While Im not saying that wal-mart is the only shitty company out there, the film shows good insight into corporate greed and bullshit"
26743892165,"What if I told you walmart subsidizes the federal government with the tax revenues it produces, and has every right to pay employees who arent obligated to work there any legal wage they want - morpheous meme"
26743896194,"Isnt this retail life in general though? Just exactly how much should Walmart, or any company, pay an unskilled worker? Okay, they probably do profit more than most, but does that mean because of that, cashiers or greeters should make $20/hr with full benefits? Lets say they do that. Well, then every other retailer has to follow suit, places close up shop, more jobs are lost, and Walmart is at fault yet again. "
26743898605,"I once asked to give a customer service rep a kudos at walmart, they had me fill out five minutes of paperwork. Cmon walmart "
26743900041,"I worked at Walmart for 5 years (from senior year in high school until I found a job in my preferred field after graduating from my university). I was never treated poorly, I made more than minimum wage for MA (I felt it was fair for the work I did), and my managers never asked me to volunteer time. I worked very hard, I enjoyed the daily grind, and I always received good performance reviews. Im not saying that what you all are saying is untrue, just that you need to consider that its not always the corporation as a whole, since each store can be run a little differently. My store was always enjoyable to work in, and I know most of the people there that worked with me are still happy being with the company. Theyve had a lot of room for growth and promotions, and the customers mostly enjoy their experience from what Ive always heard. Maybe we just had the right mix of employees to create the atmosphere, but the business itself never felt corrupt like all these stories and documentaries try to make it seem."
26743902359,"For every one that chooses to walk, there 10 willing to start the next morning. Lower the wage to $5 and they would still have 4 for every one. Part time jobs with low wages are going to be more common in the future. Small business can barely afford the employees they have and a higher minimum wage would mean some have to go and the remaining get to work twice as hard. Higher costs, mean higher prices. How are all those minimum wage part timers going to afford the affordable health care act."
26743903530,Solution: listen to libertarians and end public welfare which relies on government redistribution of force.
26743909160,"You assume that if we had no welfare programs that Wal-Mart would pay more. That cannot be farther from the truth. Wal-Mart, almost exclusively, hires people for UNSKILLED labor positions. A position literally everyone can do, it requires no marketable skill. For example, a job that required extensive training and experience pays more than a job that requires **zero** training and **zero** experience."
26743912358,"Well I just dont buy crap from Walmart, havent in probably a good 15 years. I go to Costco, or my local Target. But it just seems like these companies are just making slaves out of their workers with no real thought to them as human beings. If they would pull their heads out of their asses and actually pay their employees better working wages, then this might not happen. But employess to companies like this are just numbers, and bottom line figures and nothing else. Seriously though, folks, if this really bothers you that much, just dont patronize their stores. Dont buy from them. "
26743915574,"Thought of another way: social safety net programs allow workers to work for lower wages than they would otherwise be able to. Its a chicken and egg. Were these programs started in response to Walmart paying low wages, or did Walmart start out paying low wages because they knew they could push their workers onto public assistance. "
26743921737,Are we mad that Wal-Mart is employing people or that employed people are getting government subsidies? Neither of these things offends me. Did you know that most Fortune 500 employees collect Social Security when they retire? Fat Cat Fortune 500 companies rely on government safety net to pay portion of retirees income. I bet thatll make your butt hurt.
26743925284,Disgusting. 
26743927700,My mother and I hate this place so much that we drive 45 mins just to go to Target.
26743929444,"Raise the minimum wage to $20/hr and well still be paying for them. Because once inflation catches up, that will be the new bottom. Not to mention, just because Walmart can afford to pay that wage does not mean all businesses can. "
26743930572,"It isnt just walmart either, a lot of retail pays barely above minimum wage with almost no hours. We shouldnt just blame walmart, but all these places that pay their employees less than a liveable wage."
26743932579,"Cant you see the propaganda here? Unions are missing out on billions in dollars in revenue! They have singled out Walmart just because they are the biggest employer. There are a lot if other bad companies and many other industries have worse working conditions and wages. When I lived in the Midwest, I was jealous of my friends that worked at Walmart. I worked at a restaurant and sometimes didnt even make minimum wage. The work was much harder than any job at Walmart. I didnt get breaks, and I was taken advantage of regularly. "
26743936842,"There managers make around $140,000. A lot of it bonus money. "
26743939273,i think theyve reversed it. the intrusion of taxpayer-funded programs into the labor market lowered wages 
26743939279, Employers should pay a living wage. It should be high enough to DQ the worker from food stamps.
26743944658,"Having worked for Wal-Mart for 8 years through high school and college, I can say it wasnt that bad. Yeah there were some shitty policies but when dealing with such a large company, it comes with the territory. Your work experience is largely dependent on the managers you have working above you as with any job. Their low wages are par for the course but by the time I graduated college I was making really good money after all my annual raises. I pushed carts a majority of those years because it was good exercise and I like the outdoors. Economics dictate wages if people are willing to work for that, then they are going to pay that. That comes at the consequence of hiring a lot of shitty workers and some of those shitty workers become managers, who in turn, make working for Wal-Mart a shitty experience. Unless you become a manager, its really not a job in which you can raise a family with. Dont expect big bucks working a job more suited for a high school student."

I can remember that our stores turnover GOAL for the year was 45%. 45%!? Its because they have no qualms at all with letting someone go, no matter how long they have worked our how dedicated the employee. What was probably the most shocking thing to me of all is how the store co-managers (there is a manager and 2 cos along with many underling assistant managers) can make 100k a year which was confirmed by one of them during a new hire orientation I attended.

26743957708,"Im a former Wal-Mart graveyard shift worker 13 years ago. Next to Frys Electronics, WM is the worst retail business to work for, because they never treat you as a human being, only a worker bee drone. I quit the job as a stocker when two assistant managers accuse me of placing two ladders in the corner of the aiseles, and they took the polaroid photos to claim Im at fault when I worked the pet food and supplies area. I dont recollect ever using the ladders in the corner of the aisle when pet food and supplies are adjacent in the rows of aisles. Much later, 12 years later, I met an older college student who told me he worked as an assistant manager at a different WM location. He agreed with me about the uniformly cynical corporate culture of management. This cynical attitude supervising the dozens of worker bee drones felt overwhelmingly negative for which he had to quit since it made him feel unhappy, having to kiss the upper managements ass constantly while ruling over the worker bees with selective criticism. WM probably lost its soul after the founder Sam Walton died, and greedy predatory capitalism takes over with pressure of suppliers for the discount-rate price and support of outsourcing for manufacturing at a cheaper rate to import and sell for a profit. WM is unabashedly evil in exploitation and greed, worshiping the almighty dollar. Ah, America."

I never said that to anyone ever and I didnt even work in the electronics department that day. I was stocking the hardware department the whole day and I have a Assistant Manager to back me up.

26744623898,"Not Walmart but Target, I worked at Target my first few years of college. Every semester I had to submit a new availability calendar to work around my classes. I did this as requested and got it approved by my team leader. Over the next several weeks they kept scheduling me outside of my availability, forcing me to choose to skip classes or skip work. I complained about this probably a half dozen times, to HR, to my team leader, even to the store manager... they all assured me they would take care of it but if I was scheduled I must come in to work, even if they make a mistake. I skipped some classes, but some I could not skip, and after 3 or 4 such occasions I was called into the big bosses office and asked why I was missing so much work. I explained the story exactly as I am right now, and he knew about it because I had spoken to him a few weeks earlier about it... Get this, after a few minutes of arguing about whether it was reasonable or not to force me to skip my classes he told me that I had to get my priorities straight.... that was that last fucking straw, I told him I have my priorities straight, my college education is my priority, I will not be a loser working in retail in my 40s, I am graduating with a degree in computer science in two years and I promise I will come back here as a software engineer and have you carry my bags to my Corvette. Consider this my resignation.... I did come back after graduating and starting a good career, but that guy had been transferred to a different store, I did see and talk to my old team leader for a moment though, felt good. (never did get that Corvette... got 2 sons instead, but theyre better)"

But they didnt. 2: I find it amazing that so many people are whining like juvenile assholes because a website is having server problems. During my time on Reddit, Ive seen the site go down because of excessive server load at least 2-3 times a week. Yet nobody on Reddit thinks that its proof that Reddit needs to be repealed. We all just understand that its how the Internet works."
26931361297,"The difference is that reddit is not a federally mandated program, nor is reddits function crucial to the improvement of the health care system. Im pretty much aghast with all the lead time involved (4 years), and the history of failed govt IT programs (IRS overhaul, Medicare Part D), that HHS allowed themselves to get screwed so badly."
26931301602,Upvote for you sir.
26931314930,"1) They did state the problems multiple times. People like you call them tea terrorists American Taliban every time they raised a legitimate objections because your messiah couldnt be even slightly wrong. 2) When reddit goes down, it goes down for a moment and comes back up. The other 99% of the time people can create accounts post links and comments and everything reddit promises. When healthcare.gov is up, nothing is working, not account creation, not sign up. When a user slips through the cracks and actually signs up for a plan, the insurance company has to hire someone to decipher the garbled application that the website creates."

26803623452,"Disagreement with the handling of someone who broke a large number of high-profile federal laws is not a scandal. While I applaud Snowden for raising awareness, all he did was expose wide-ranging, *but completely legal* NSA surveillance. Everything the NSA did was either approved by the courts or explicitly authorized under the Patriot Act. The outrage should not be over the fact that this surveillance occurs, but rather that theres nothing illegal about it. Wake up, people--this shit has been legal (and ongoing) for well over a decade. Its a little late to be acting surprised."

26803225389,"Considering it was a Republican administration (Bush II) that crafted the so called Patriot Act, and a Republican dominated Congress that passed it, and right leaning Supreme Court that declared it constitutional the republicans have no right to complain just because the illegal and immoral spying program they created, authorized, and put into place is used by a non-Republican administration."

26781570350,"Fact check: **FALSE.** Dick Cheney did *NOT* profit handsomely and directly from the Iraq war. Before he entered office, he assigned all of his stock options to charity and purchased an insurance policy to guarantee his deferred compensation. He didnt stand to gain or lose *a single penny* based on Haliburtons performance. Not one cent. http://www.factcheck.org/kerry_ad_falsely_accuses_cheney_on_halliburton.html &gt;**Summary** &gt;A Kerry ad implies Cheney has a financial interest in Halliburton and is profiting from the companys contracts in Iraq. The fact is, Cheney doesnt gain a penny from Halliburtons contracts, and almost certainly wont lose even if Halliburton goes bankrupt. - - &gt;**Stock Options** &gt;That still would leave the possibility that Cheney could profit from his Halliburton stock options if the companys stock rises in value. However, Cheney and his wife Lynne have assigned any future profits from their stock options in Halliburton and several other companies to charity. And were not just taking the Cheneys word for this -- we asked for a copy of the legal agreement they signed, which we post here publicly for the first time. &gt;The Gift Trust Agreement the Cheneys signed two days before he took office turns over power of attorney to a trust administrator to sell the options at some future time and to give the after-tax profits to three charities. The agreement specifies that 40% will go to the University of Wyoming (Cheneys home state), 40% will go to George Washington Universitys medical faculty to be used for tax-exempt charitable purposes, and 20% will go to Capital Partners for Education, a charity that provides financial aid for low-income students in Washington, DC to attend private and religious schools. &gt;The agreement states that it is irrevocable and may not be terminated, waived or amended, so the Cheneys cant take back their options later."
26781517940,"Ad the problem there is that if they are rich, they probably have investments that will influence their votes/policies. Which is why some use blind trusts for their investments while in office. Of course some dont. Dick Cheney didnt and owned massive blocks of Halliburton stock. He profited handsomely and directly from the Iraq war."
26781579911,"Wow! I was wrong! Does his charitable giving have an impact on his taxes? If the value of his options go up, does he get more tax benefit? Anyway, I wont be repeating that again, since I consider Fact Check to be a reputable source. Thank you for correcting me."

27008931550,&gt;13 separate Gallup multiple-day polls Another way to say this is 42% of jobless people who are willing to conduct phone surveys Identify as Independents.
27008989913,"Independent is an actual party. It is a conservative party used as a ploy by Republicans, including Tea Partiers, to mobilize the apathetic vote. If you dont want to be registered with a party, register as unaffiliated. "
27008648281,Probably tea party considering themselves independent but still voting republican.
27008597952,Still a 0-percent chance that the next U.S. president will be an Independent.
27008695874,"The only reason the GOP wins anything is because of redistricting. Basically, destroying the democratic principle of majority wins. It takes a whole lot more votes to elect Democrat than the same exact districts Republican and thats just plain wrong and unfair. Its changing the rules, moving the goal line- its literally the only way the horrible ideas of the current GOP are even voted on at all."
27008587205,I wonder what percentage of them will vote Independent. 
27009072973,Independent is what a conservative calls himself when he realizes the GOP is an embarrassment. Not that it changes his voting pattern.
27008640073,There is no doubt that part...just part...of that is the influx into the libertarian view on many issues.
27008914372,"This aint going to change much. For most of the last 2 decades most Americans havent identified themselves as Republicans and yet election after election, the GOP has won. This shows how powerful of a tool apathy is for the Republican party. When they are able to turn off Americans from voting and convince people that both parties are the same it greatly works to their favor. This is also why being able to block or discourage certain groups is such a priority for them. If they can stifle the black, Hispanic or inner city vote, then the GOP has a chance because their members tend to vote fairly consistency like good little soldiers."
27008554440,The republicans have known full well their base is eroding. Thats why theyve worked so hard to suppress voting and to gerrymander districts. Dont expect the make-up of congress to change much any time soon.
27008824260,"I know a lot of people who are very much consistent GOP lever voters who claim to be independent. I mean lets face it, it is downright embarrassing to claim to be a Republican these days."
27008670031,"I hate these statistics because I dont know anyone who has been surveyed, and I cant see how it is representative as a result. Tell me why Im wrong."
27008756350,"sure. get back to me when [the reelection rate for Congressional incumbents](https://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/reelect.php) (from either party) starts to drop much below 90 percent. it would be nice, but it would also be more than a little surprising especially if it persisted for more than one election cycle. "
27008574577,identify as != vote as or even vote
27008577782,"100% Americans should be independent. Why on earth should we be asked, when registering to vote, to implicitly endorse one party over the other (thereby implicitly rejecting the other)? "
27008747256,Good thing Republicans have some tricks up their sleeves like gerrymandering and voter identification requirements!
27008993789,A independent is someone whom will vote either way depending on which candidate they feel is better. However the truth behind the new rise of independents is that most of them are just embarrassed republicans that will still vote for what ever turd the GOP produces. Calling themselves independents just makes them feel better.. 
27008607480,Does this mean they will vote for reasonable people and we can be done with this shit now?
27008656761,"The thing to remember is that most people who claim they are independent are not. People like to feel different and important, but if you ask most independents who theyve voted for in the past ten years, you are going to see that they usually vote for the same party year in and year out"
27008745458,"Yet every election, everybody gets scared by the other camp and then just votes for either Democrat or Republican."
27008988142,"I register as a Repulblican so I can vote in their primaries and call myself a Republican, but the GOP is a joke and youve got to be either rich or stupid (religious) to support it. The Dems are bought and paid for by Wall Street, too, so fuck both parties. The Hon. Bernie Sanders says its impossible to pass legislation that Wall St. doesnt like, anyway so fuck it all. Politics is a rigged game and unless youve got a couple hundred million dollars lying around ready to burn, the ones who do will keep power."
27008742634,No incumbents 2016! Whos with me?
27008749163,"And that means ... zero. Americans can identify as whatever the fuck they want, the government is bought and paid for by lobbies and big business. And Im pretty sure about 99% of those groups identify as members of the FuckYouImRich Party, which is, BY FAR, the most influential political party in Washington, followed closely by the OldWhiteMenWith1950sMorals Party. Note: It is VERY easy, and generally encouraged, to be a member of BOTH those parties."
27008609255,No surprising. To an outsider the Republican Party seems like a political tool for corporate interests only. 
27008617835,You all need to educate yourselves on the Commission for Presidential debates before discussing the relevance of this poll. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NXhoP5bQ2M&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player
27008591633,"Im happy to see this number. The more people that dont align with a single party, the sooner politicians will start voting on issues as they should instead of just being partisan and voting what their party wants of them."
27008578066,"As a registered Republican for over 32 years, the last 10 as a RINO, I finally changed my voter registration because the party no longer represents me. It all came down to being too embarrassed to even be identified as such. Hello? Science anyone?"
27008711195,Bill Oreilly calls himself an independent...
27008969104,"I dont care about how they identify. I care about how they vote. And the bulk of them vote Republican, but since Bush II are embarassed to admit it. As well they should be."

27009060364,"independents - I know so many of these online. They defend republicans, hold republican ideals and vote for republicans, but they are independents god dammit!"
27009044225,But still vote for republican or democrat.
27008775171,"Honestly, I feel ¨C as a recent Republican voter ¨C this is due to the polarisation of the Republican party. I have conservative tendencies (deficit hawk amongst others) yet I cannot, and refuse to be, enamoured by the religious and moral aspects that tend to dominate the Republican party. "
27008597900,"Partway through 2003, people were evenly split between Republican, Democrat, and Independent, all at about 33%. Democrats have fallen to 31% and Republicans to 25%, while Independents have climbed to 42%. Just looking at the numbers, it seems pretty clear that people who used to identify as Republican have moved to Independent. As a former Republican who is now registered to vote with No Party Affiliation, my anecdotal personal experience supports the data. The weird part is that when I talk politics with Republicans, they seem determined to call me RINO and heap scorn on me and pretty much do everything they can to keep me from coming back. Doesnt seem a very effective strategy."
27008656015,Probably stated like a thousand times already but a lot of these self-proclaimed Independents lean toward one party a lot more than the other 
27009036164,and yet everyone in my fucking suburb is a republican
27008430513,"This could be misleading. I know people who always vote Republican but insist theyre independent. I think they want to be perceived as more open-minded and rational, but when you talk to them its just Fox News talking points. I think theyre aware theres a perception of crazy extremism, but not so much that theyd actually change their views on anything. Just enough to disavow association, while remaining a proponent of crazy extremist views."
27008353458,"Like I said, the religious right is destroying the Republican Party. Unfortunately, theyll do a hell of a lot of damage before theyre dead. "
27008865713,"People really started abandoning the Republicans after 2004 when they had the presidency and both houses and started spending like crazy. I think there is a large chunk of the country that wants a fiscally conservative government. Basically spend money in trying to help the truly needdy, provide a military that can defend us not maintain a world empire, and provide some essential traditional government functions like courts, roads, pollution control, etc. It seems neither party is about that anymore. Its all about wealth transfers to the wealthy. The fight is just about which group of wealthy gets the spoils."
27008877233,Pretty clear that the GOP has damaged its reputation badly since 2010. Dems were steady during that period. Itll be interesting to see if independent candidates can seriously cut into the two-party system in 2016. My guess is that it will take another couple decades.
27008635711,"Means a lot less to me than it would have in 2008. Now Ive seen, after 5 years of the Obama administration, how little Democrats care for regular citizens as well. Sure most Americans will have health care soon, but that crowning achievement is mostly a win for private insurers and pharmaceutical companies. Hopefully it will lead to better things, but that seems like a long shot. Obama expanded unconstitutional mass surveillance on US citizens and gave himself the ability to unilaterally drone Americans to death without any due process. The stimulus wasnt bad, but it should has just been the start. Now our infrastructure degrades and were told there just isnt enough money to build roads and fix bridges ... meanwhile defense contractors keep filling their pockets and the oil giants continue to be subsidized. I guess Im mostly venting. The best thing that can come out of this data would be for a strong 3rd party to emerge which would disrupt the powers that be. "
27008677055,"Im so sick of partisan bullshit. Being independent doesnt make me a confused Republican or a fairweather Democrat. The idiotic apologism in this thread is just revolting. I choose not to identify with either party because I dont believe either of them are genuine. They both have high-powered PR teams that waste a shit-ton of money trying to buy votes. Fuck them and fuck their brands. It they actually respected my opinion, they wouldnt have dedicated an entire marketing campaign to changing it. /rant Tl;dr Voting Republican or Democrat is like voting for McDonalds or Burger King. Partisan poitics is superficial and soulless like commercial marketing. Thats why people are independent."
27008817071,Which is why we need instant runoff voting. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting Instant run-off allows third parties to exist without creating the splitter effect. If 42% of the electorate is independent then certainly we need more than just the Republicans and Democrats. 
27008634145,"The US is crying out for a viable third party. Then the Democrats could be the middle party they really are, Republicans could reinvent themselves and jettison the crazy people holding them to ransom and people could have a viable choice between a right, left and middle. You think you know gridlock. Allow me to introduce you to Europe, my friends *evil laugh*"
27008428835,"For those hoping this means we can get a third party, lets look at the numbers. Lets say there is a left leaning third party, which takes all of the left leaning independents (16%) and those that dont lean (12%), giving the third party 28%, Democrats 31%, and Republicans (who still get right leaning independents) 41%. If there was a right leaning third party you get third party 28%, Democrats 47%, and Republicans 25%. In either case the third party [spoils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect) the primary party they are most similar to, the least advantageous outcome for the independents. Doubt theyll make the same mistake again with results like that. We wont get a third party until we escape [Duvergers Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvergers_law). I suggest [Approval Voting](http://www.electology.org/approval-voting)."
27008559652,"im listed as unaffiliated because i vote for people, not parties, but this also means i cant vote in the primary"
27008401581,This doesnt mean as much as it might seem. Shifts in identification do not necessarily mean a change in actual opinion or voting habits. Often as a party becomes more and more unpopular the people that still subscribe to the beliefs of that part dont want the label of belonging to that party. So this might not mean there are any less Republican voters in the world. Just less people that want to be called republican. 
27008553133,Thats because its *cool* to be Libertarian.
27008595503,Just give us open primaries already. Youre taking votes away from people having closed primaries. It discourages unaffiliated voters.
27008337949,Beautiful! Maybe we can stop with this Two-Party bull-shit sooner than I thought.
27008402873,[deleted]
27008352849,No surprise here. The GOP has been digging its grave for years.
27008363416,And yet independents always vote Republican.
27008407392,"What is wrong with those 42%? They must hate gay marital rights, or womens abortive rights, or minorities civil rights, or human rights, or the earth, or science, or equality, or else they would join the winning team. Idiots."
27008483622,This doesnt mean shit. Their line of bullshit is still the same.. Most of these people hold the same beliefs they are just trying to divorce themselves from the shit show they supported for the past decade. 
27008514173,And how was this survey went about. Surveys cant be trustworthy unless it takes out all other confounding variables. 
27008515033,[deleted]
27008533512,"In related news a record number of democrats enrolled in unemployment and health benefit programs Edit: just realized the serious climate of discussion, no place for my partisan-based humor."

27008560213,"Theres no way this can be true, because I doubt that 42% of Americans know what an independent is. "
27008563382,"This is such bullshit. Independents are just Republicans who are too ashamed to admit it or think their lack of Party affiliation is some grand testament to their impartiality, which of course is non-existent."
27008579735,Of that 42% I bet you at the very least 75% of them vote democrat 95% of the time. So out of that original 42% of Independents between 32-34% of them are voting Democrat All The Time. Math baby.. Math. ;)

27008592819,Hope my 3rd party absentee ballot vote isnt thrown away again like it was during the previous presidential election.
27008593011,Hello madam president.....tea pubs and rest will insure her victory by not allowing nominee from middle. You can take that to the bank.
27008596348,Excellent news. The founders warned against political parties from the very beginning of the republic. If we could get a fair debate system which is not controlled by party veterans that would be great. I registered independent last year and while I cant vote in a primary it was worth it.
27008600533,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) 2016! 
27008602812,These floating independents arent really independents. They will return to the republicans once they get their shit in order. 
27008603917,Still wishing for the Tea Party to actually schism and form an ultra right wing shit show.
27008603951,"I hope my deregistering as an R helped that, even though I never really voted for them in recent years. "
27008604002,"The more readily available the facts become to a more widespread audience(read: interwebs), the political power of the Republican party will continue to decline."
27008605716,2016 will be a realigning election.
27008606381,"Its more because of the tea party and those who deem the Republicans too liberal. Im no longer a Republican, but Ill likely never vote for a Democrat. Im more likely to go Libertarian next time."
27008607286,"the GOP batshit crazy extremism of the last four years tastes like ass, marketingwise. who in their right mind could get enthusiastic about the new all corporate GOP? they forgotten how to pretend that they give a shit about the average American. Unless that average American is also an evangelical gun owner. "
27008607674,More libertarians please.
27008607952,Have we finally become tired of being categorized?
27008608212,"Its so awkward having to interact with the lower classes, might as well tell them Im independent and perhaps they wont realize that my father is a top Republican contributor. After all, no one understands my life, except for maybe the brilliant Ayn Rand. "
27008609899,Haha in my lifetime this is the lowest Ive seen of republicans.
27008610204,Probably a loss of Democrats too considering how terrible the presidency has been.
27008612095,We need all candidates to run as independents so people can decide on policy and not party affiliation.

27008617101,I could see the current political status quo fading. I hope this leads to a new party. A choice other than the left wing or the right wing. One in the middle. A moderate party.. a collection of congressmen/women who actually want to get some real work done.
27008626938,Reddit rejoices!
27008631654,If you identify yourself as a democrat you are still a republican. I have the past 2 presidencies to prove it
27008638528,"simple, first we vote out the incumbent..."
27008638890,"As a socialist, I always answer independent... cause thats basically become the blanket term for anything not Dem or Rep. "
27008639814,"the sucky thing is that the disgruntled repubs are claiming to be libertarian - and theyre in total shock when they find out that libertarian is not a fancy word for republican, and REAL libertarians dont support the GOPs fascist theocratic beliefs."

27008648690,"WHO FUCKING CARES? There is no Independent Party there is only Republicrats and Demicans - When youre in the voting booth you ONLY HAVE the lessor of these two evils to chose from... Both of whom are bought and sold long before they get on the ballot ... So start third, fourth and fifth parties or give up and vote for the Demican.... and dont even try to say that Libertarians have any chance, true Libertarians will never get elected to a high office... they are nuts; privatize EVERYTHING and OPEN BORDERS! What a disaster. The idea of Free Markets &amp; Libertarianism may be great on paper to some, but once you involve humans and Crapitalism (Thats Crony Capitalism to those of you in Rio Linda, CA) it all goes to hell."

27008651333,I dont vote because my vote doesnt matter and I dont like anyone whos running.
27008652034,Not surprising. The Republican brand is in the toilet. This Gallup poll is misleading. Majority of people when polled identify themselves as conservative more so that liberal more than 2 to 1. 
27008652419,A lot of this is just republicans(and people) realizing people hate them so they relabel themselves independent while keeping the same rigid belief system.
27008653962,"lol, muh disillusionment"

27008657035,"Independents are, for the most part, people who only know of the three existing parties. Independents dont necessarily have an argument in any sort of political discussion because they dont really want to be affiliated with a ruling party. This basically means that almost half of the U.S. hates our current political system but are too ignorant to give a shit about making informed decisions. The constituents are apathetic and thats a shame."

27008666610,"Honestly I think its because the parties are virtually indistinguishable. Now hear me out before you downvote. Im not saying that what each party purports to stand for is identical. Im saying that in action, leaders of both parties do virtually identical things. Theres no change when a new president is elected. Its just a continuation of policies regardless of party. Politics in this country has become lets attack them and make them look stupid! rather than anybody actually trying to solve any problems. People may speak about solving problems, sure. But nobody seems to ever *do* anything. That could just be my perception, of course. Edit: I no grammar good."
27008669127,I love all the young-ins who think a third party will solve everything. All you will have is another party controlled by big money. It does not matter how many parties there are in this country. Until you can get money out of politics nothing will change. 
27008671637,"Meanwhile, in another study, we learn the most independents are effectively democrats or republicans since they still tend to vote one way or another, seldom going in the opposite direction (albeit moreso than those who self-identify as democrats or republicans). If anyone can find that study Id appreciate it, Im a bit too busy to source it myself. It was released around the same time as the one were discussing in this thread. A lot of people who study politics believe that the true independent is an illusion, and that study would seem to support that. Politicians tend to group together based on their beliefs, and individual voters tend to have somewhat consistent believes as well, so it stands to reason that many voters will vote the same way most of the time, regardless of how they self-identify. Then again, Im by no means a politician so a lot of this info is just piggy-backing off of studies Ive read and political pundits. "
27008672276,They have successfully purged the non-believers from their party. Good for them.

And by tampering with the voting districts, this is probably just going to get worse. "

In my head, on the *full* ideological spectrum, Democrat and Republican politicians range in difference from about 5 to 15 percent, depending on which two you choose to compare."

I realize there is a social conservative/fiscal conservative split to an extent in the GOP and that some fiscal conservatives consider themselves libertarians (although a true libertarian would also be socially liberal) but at the end of the day these people are voting Republican. I think the most telling fact is if someone refuses to work with the Democrats on any compromise ever. If they support Republican obstructionism then I feel like you pretty much MUST call them a Republican. "
27008724650,Independents are just disenfranchised democrats that cant admit they are republicans yet.

27008729709,"This country is run by money. Voting doesnt even matter, unless youre voting for corporate interests. "
27008730058,"Thats because 41.7% of Americans are stupid. Really in a two party system you have two choices in ours its between the Republican and a Democrat. Being independent means youre not taking part in the party politics which will determine which candidate you get to either vote for or vote against. Which means your voice is not being heard when it comes to picking your representative fully. How many of you would have preferred Kucinich to Obama in 2008? Well did you get out there and vote for Kucinich did you campaign for him? No you probably didnt but youll bitch and complain about Obama winning, why? What did you do to change it and fight for a candidate you would rather prefer? We live in a two party system and until that changes you can either take part or not take part. In primaries the difference between candidates is really slim which is where a strong organized group can make a difference. So yeah you can keep bitching like most people continue to do about politics or you can get active but if youre just going to keep bitching at least be a bit quieter about it. "
27008731683,"ITT: People who dont realize that if they are cynical about the 2 existing parties, they probably would hate 3rd parties anyways as well. 3rd parties dont get smeared by their opponents in elections because they arent likely to win/be a threat. And humans, particular those in the US, are very susceptible to grass is always greener thinking -- that is to say they think a 3rd party candidate would be better than existing candidates. Would it blow your mind if I told you that some large percentage of the things both Obama and Bush have done were the BEST possible decisions that could have been made? Everyone is cynical and there is a public mood that things are worse than ever regardless of whether that is true and whether things are actually improving. That mood may be totally unjustified and a 3rd party candidate may turn out to be *worse* than the existing two partys candidates. Or they may turn out better. Or just the same. Of course after a few political cycles theyll be attacked by their political opponents so it shouldnt be long before you hate that 3rd party just as much as you hate the first 2. Im not against having more choices, and I would like to see the electoral process change to move away from this winner takes all stuff, but I wish people would stop deluding themselves into thinking being president is a simple job or that there are simple solutions to our problems.

27008828701,"When people claim that most of these Independents are Right Wingers in Rugged Individualist clothing, I think it speaks specifically to the rise of modern Ron/Rand Paul-style Libertarianism, which has roped in more than a few former Lefties as well. There is a growing section of organic/homeopath/naturopath/yoga/new age/vegan Left that is getting led down the same anti-government, anti-MSM conspiracy path via supposed natural websites like NaturalNews and NaturalCuresNotMedicine that on the surface appeal to middle class urbanites, but also push anti-vaxx, anti-fluoride, anti-GMO rhetoric as anti-government click bait. People have figured out how to sell InfoWars/PrisonPlanet style paranoia to the Left. Its the same type of circular relinking echo-chamber that floods skewed and falsified stories alongside practical help on making a working compost bin. I think people in general are getting more bullshit anti-everything propaganda from these frauds and charlatans, and its feeding their egos to think they somehow see behind the curtain, that they are truly independent. But the only thing they are independent of is critical thinking. The fewer people in general who participate in mainstream politics, the easier it is for larger powers to manipulate the electorate, and the more captive eyeballs they get clicking on their faux outrage, the easier it is to spread anti-government propaganda. And the more people that distrust the government - the Peoples main vehicle for expression of will - the easier it is for corporate and religious constructs to dominate the process. They dont give a shit WHY you hate the government, they just want you to help vote it out of power."

27072440202,"Have at it. &gt;33 states and the District of Columbia get back more Federal tax dollars than they pay in. Ironically, considering the Republican Party champions low taxes and cutting Federal taxes, 21 of the 33 states who get back more than the taxpayers in those states pay in are also states who voted for John McCain in 2008. http://taxfoundation.org/article/federal-taxing-and-spending-benefit-some-states-leave-others-paying-bill-1 http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/26/blog-posting/red-state-socialism-graphic-says-gop-leaning-state/ http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_reckoning/2012/10/25/blue_state_red_face_guess_who_benefits_more_from_your_taxes.html "
27072452284,If you would have answered my question you would have seen the point. These account for **all federal money** that is being spent in that State. This includes bases and federal infrastructure. The Lions share of bases are in the South. Its not as if all southern states are broke and require money to operate. The federal government is spending money on federal government things and then articles like these are spinning it to make it a divisive issue of southern states taking more money.

Thats the part of me that like to believe 100% evil doesnt exist. The other part feels like they made the opportunity and didnt give a fuck what happened. In that case 9/11 was just very convenient, and removed the necessity for any subtlety. The first thing that snapped me out of my prolonged shock being a New Yorker at that time was reading the word Iraq on the cover of the Post. My first thought was, You sons of bitches. Went back to being my old cynical self after that and my temporarily enhanced sense of patriotism melted. Halliburton showers electrocute GIs and contracted spooks leak secrets.

That sounds like a horrible, horrible idea on so many different levels I might end up creating a daily blog just to list them all. To begin with these workers already make $7.25- and end up needing government assistance in order to survive. Giving them a 75 cent raise will not remove the need for government to intervene and continue to give them assistance. All it would do is give more welfare to large corporations and leave the workers in the exact same position. Furthermore this will not create many jobs at all, if anything it may end up HURTING the economy and cause unemployment to go up. A Mc Donalds or a Walmart will not simply hire more employees if they have to pay them less. They will hire employees based on the amount of demand or workload that exists. If a local Mc Donald has 5 full time employees they will continue to have 5 as those 5 workers have already met the demand. Profits will be pocketed and the workers will see none of it. "

But even assuming advances in medical technology, old people will not quite be able to work for the most part. Hence FICA/equivalent rates will have to increse. Theyre 33% in Italy now they will only grow. Perhaps its sustainable but it will be creaking: how many jobs will remain in legal and not underground economy if FICA approaches 50%? So: 1. its early retirement funded into old age for the ss newcomers 2. so so retirement for a few years for current workers 3. work till you drop dead or at best measly fraction of what you paid in for todays children. Theoretically, if ceteris paribus applies (productivity, econ growth, current or better reproduction rates) its sustainable. But probably it isnt, due to what I paid in is mine give it to me back dammit mentality: this will bulge debt higher and higher (as net losers will demand in hotter and hotter terms of getting at least 100% of what they paid in, thus increasing rates in the future) into closer and closer future, counting now as 20-30 years from now.

While projected benefits might be sustainable in total quantity ceteris paribus, that masks the basic problem: that individual rate of contributions to benefits hes likely to get given his probable longevity turns from incredible (look up how much Ida May Fuller got for her contribution) to break even to negative. Thats where the snag is: in classic Ponzi scheme investors are defecting because they realize this thing is not sustainable given faith of other people. In legalized, multi-generational pay as you go (wage tax for current worker =&gt; retirement of former worker) the whole thing will turn unsustainable after returns turn negative, which is now. I have calculated using data from Urbain Institute that the turning point is about now for most groups and for some groups (high earning single males) were past that point. It wont be detection of fraud that will break ss, it will be politics of people hating ss because they will get less than they paid in - because the grudging acceptance of the scheme among the people relies mainly on perceiving it as retirement fund (I paid in dammit, Im entitle to get at least my contributions out). The number of links you posted does not prove that ss is not a legalized pyramid scheme that is unsustainable (if classic ponzi term is too offensive to you), its only that so many people grow desperate about the future of this system, because people doing cold financial math conclude its sustainability is at least in danger: http://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2008/fs080528.cfm"

Thats how pyramid keeps growing, of course until the point that everyone loses faith in it."

Putting aside what Benjamin Franklin had to say on the topic for a moment: I have yet to see any evidence that all this intelligence gathering (invading?) actually increases safety. For instance, the reason for the airport scanners, the underwear bomber, was known to be plotting something, [but they didnt even put him on the no-fly list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Farouk_Abdulmutallab#Awareness_by_US_Intelligence). Or the most recent attack in Boston. Sure they had he and his brothers phone records and internet history, but did that prevent the attack? And, again, [they had been warned about the kid and the trouble he was likely to start](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/06/10/patriot-act-author-sensenbrenner-data-mining-led-to-missed-signals-in-boston-bombing). And now that the civil government is working on prosecuting and building a case against the remaining brother, will the NSA release that data to help in prosecution? Theyve made it clear the answer is no. So collecting the data doesnt protect anyone. Nor can it be used after the fact to help with prosecuting (thats assuming there actually is legal case brought forward). Oh, by the way, were all paying for all this equipment and staffing, and for what exactly? What are we getting back in return for our money and lost liberties? It sure isnt a little temporary safety.

26786304620,"Democracy is a very poor choice of words and the distinction is vital, our democracy isnt being limited, our liberty is being limited. Liberty itself means a lot of different things for people as well. A libertarian, I would think, would be most concerned with the freedom from compulsion, and a strong sense of individual responsibility. A lot of liberals focus liberty towards egalitarianism. My definition is much more specific, I want to forever be non-dependent from other peoples choices. The USs security apparatus on a core level violates all definitions and every law, ever piece of data further degrades our liberty. However, the United States is the leader of the free world, we have responsibilities to the world, and one of those is the protection of both US citizens, and citizens of our allies. We have a very large target on our back, and so programs such as this will always exist. There is a reason that there isnt one industrialized country in the world that doesnt have an extensive security infrastructure, the threat is real. Look at the 20th century, two world wars, and the rise of the two most evil philosophies, nazism and communism. You know, you can almost point to the very second in history when the United States took the torch from Britain, it was 02/21/1947 when British diplomats came to DC and called a meeting with the State Department and gave us too problems. Greece was in a civil war and the Greek royal family was very much loosing to the communist-led, Soviet backed, rebels, and it was well known that if Greece fell, Turkey was going as well. Britain just couldnt handle the situation any more and handed over the keys to the Empire. Truman went to congress, asked for a check for $400 million and handed it to Greece. The cash restarted their economy and saved the region from communism. We just dont remember how close the entire continent of Europe, minus Britain, was from being gobbled up by communism. France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey, all had massive food, and fuel shortages. The people were looking for anything to save them and Truman made George Marshall his Secretary of State, and gave him one job. Rebuilt Europe. None of this would have happened if we had argued this in the public domain, people were tired after WWII. George Marshal once gave a speech to congress, probably one of the most famous of his post WWII. Why must the United States carry so great a load in helping Europe? The answer is simple. The United States is the only country in the world today which has the economic power and productivity to furnish the needed assistance. The six and eight-tenths billion proposed for the first fifteen months is less than a single month¡¯s charge of the war. To be quite clear, this unprecedented endeavor of the new world to help the old is neither sure nor easy. It is a calculated risk. It is a difficult program. And you know, far better than I do, the political difficulties involved in this program. But there¡¯s no doubt whatever in my mind that, if we decide to do this thing, we can do it successfully. And there¡¯s also no doubt in my mind that the whole world hangs in the balance as to what it is to be. The United States spent $15 billion in 6 years in 14 countries. Not one of them fell to communism. For 60 years the US, as the worlds leader has successfully kept another world war from happening, and for 50 years we held back the iron curtain.

He had NSA whistleblowers William Binney, Thomas Drake, and Russ Tice to thank for that foresight. It is true that in 2012, Obama added new whistleblower protections that did not exist when Binney, Drake, and Tice worked for the NSA. However: &gt;All the experts we have talked to were more than eager to acknowledge that Obama has done more to protect whistleblowers than any other president before him. But national security whistleblowers represent a glaring exception. The Obama administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than any president before. &gt;Additionally, Obama didnt manage to get whistleblowers access to jury trials, which was part of his original promise. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/426/increase-protections-for-whistleblowers/ I will also note that saying Snowden followed no such procedures, hence, under the law, he is not a whistleblower is shortsighted, and it seems that you may have fallen victim to legal wordplay. A whistleblower is a person who exposes misconduct, alleged dishonest or illegal activity occurring in an organization.

26877480326,"I would love to see some defense for that statement because we were running deficits long before Reagan. You can harp on him for spending too much, or for spending too much on the military, but lets not just make up facts. Im going to assume youre critiquing Reagan as a liberal and not a tea-party budget hawk. Why are you upset about deficit spending when we were in a recession. Unemployment hit double digits in 1982. A liberal prescription for such an economy would be to rack up a large deficit."
26877687302,"I agree 100% on the issue of trickle down, or trickle on as we like to call it where everyone downside gets a shower of gold. However the debt is on the head of the Democrats . Reagan certainly could have vetoed the bills had he wished but all the spending originated in the House of Representatives. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Presidents_and_control_of_Congress) Reagans party never had control of the House of Representatives. Thus every dime of debt was caused by the actions of the Democratic party. Now I suppose Reagan could have done more but there were reasons he didnt, he was fairly liberal and the kind of ideological gridlock we have now was yet in its infancy. It was not socially acceptable especially during the cold war. Also historically the US basically cant balance a budget most of the time. The eagerness of the federal government to expand programs far outstrips our ability to raise revenue. Its not a coincidence that in the last 50 years, only 5 budgets were balanced. [Source](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/may/07/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-balanced-budgets-rare/) and that if [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/politics/balanced-budget/index.html) is to be believed, we may never have a balanced budget again. And in case any Europeans ask why dont you raise taxes there are three reasons we really cant have a welfare state #1 Super high military spending #2 High immigration #3 Lack of social comity. The last kind of requires an explanation, each society has a certain level of corruption and sense of we are in this together The US has too much corruption and too little sense of togetherness to support European taxation levels. Even if you could get enough votes to force them, people many of whom have studied the issue will find as many ways to avoid paying. Its entirely possible that people would cease economic activity making it harder to gain revenue. If [Hausers Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauser%27s_law) is factual and it seems to have some merit within 10-20% or less margin, the effective Federal revenue is limited by the size of GDP and more importantly the distribution of it which of course in a Trickle On economy means the people most adverse to paying taxes often with the least need end up with all the revenue. Trying to keep the Federal leviathan operating thus requires borrowing or minting insane sums of money something that may not be sustainable. "

A federal judge in the 60s ruled that the FBI files on King links to communism to remain top-secret until 2027. Senator Jesse Helms appealed to the Supreme Court in 1983 to release the files, so the correct bill in the Senate to create the Martin Luther King Federal Holiday could be abolished.

Politifact rates this false. Fast and Furious started 9 months into his Presidency. Same program, different name. The point being that it was an adaptation of an initiative instituted under Bush. An initiative aimed at fighting the drug war which was revised and adapted after Obama took office. It was essentially a scenario where this was a plan that the ATF was using for years and Obamas administration decided to see those tactics through to fruition, instead of abruptly uprooting years of efforts. The point still remains that this is not Obamas brain child or his initiative, but one of the previous administration. &gt;Does this annul President Obama of any wrong doing because it was happening before he was elected. It continued after he was elected and he defends the program. He also extended the Patriot Act so he doesnt get points off for that either. It doesnt mean he deserves the blame for it, especially since hes curtailed it. The fact of the matter is that for nearly the past decade our national defense and national security has been built off of systems set forth and enabled through the Patriot Act. It would be highly irresponsible, inefficient, and a risk to national security to suddenly undue years of infrastructure that our intelligence network and defense now relies upon. It is much better and sager to taper our dependence on that infrastructure created by the Patriot Act and phase it out over time. His 4 year extension is exactly that and it only extends 3 provisions of the Patriot Act. So he actually deserves credit for taking the initiative in reducing the infringements of the original bill, thus giving us time to wean off of it. "

Really? Thats not just a little bit hyperbolic? &gt; Consumers have always been kept in the dark about pink slime, meat glue, rBGH and GMOs in their food. And now, if the IDFA gets its way, youll be able to drink hormone-contaminated milk from an antibiotics-inundated cow fed genetically modified crops and producing milk containing hidden aspartame. And you wont have the right to know about any of this! Well first of all, its already illegal to sell milk from a cow receiving antibiotics. Organic brands tried to trick consumers by labeling their milk as anti-biotic free and were forced to stop since technically thats true of all milk sold (legally) in the United States. Plus I dont really need all this anti-science/anti-GMO FUD. And then it goes on to being all pro-raw milk. Are you shitting me? Raw milk is dangerous.

This ownership is, of course, a form of genetic enslavement that seeks to dominate and control all humans. How, exactly? Consider this: When you have a child, you are replicating your genetic code. Because your genetic code is 20% patented and owned by someone else, the act of having a child is, by definition, an act of genetic piracy that you are committing in violation of the law. These companies that own your genetic code can, if they wish, demand you pay royalties for every child you create. They can even demand that you pay them royalties for your own body replicating cells during processes like healing skin wounds or generating new red blood cells. Your body, in fact, replicates millions of cells each day, causing you to violate the U.S. governments laws on the theft of intellectual property. You are the criminal! "

How about the pus content of its dairy products? How about its inhumane treatment of animals who are subjected to torture conditions and pumped full of genetically engineered hormones? How about the fact that homogenization and pasteurization turn a whole food into a dietary nightmare that promotes obesity, autoimmune disorders and cardiovascular disease 1. Raw milk, raw milk in general has some risks to it. the milk may contain bacteria or other ailments that may cause consumers who dont drink it often to get sick. in no way is raw milk healthier for you than pasturized milk, pasturized milk is for the safety of the consumers. the milk is heated to high temperatures for a short period of time to kill bacteria that could be harmful to us. its the same as washing an apple that may have fallen on the ground. too much of anything is a bad thing, if you are a healthy person keeping up a nutritional diet, milk will not make you obese, or give you cardiovascular disease. 2. the dairy industry does not pump their cows with any growth hormone or antibiotics to improve milk yields. if they do they need to state it on the label. it is actually illegal for milk to contain either. if cows have either in their system farmers move them to a hospital pen and are milked separately from the rest, and poured down the drain. it never comes into contact with the milk we drink today. before the milk even leaves the farm it is tested for any traces of hormones or antibiotics and if any is found then the milk is dumped on the spot and does not go into milk processing. 3. on the topic of pus in milk, dairy farmers hand milk the cows first to test if there is any unusual discharge from the udders before the actual milking begins. if there is any irregularities then the cow is moved to another pen and milked separately and that milk is poured down the drain. 4. the inhumane treatment of animals is not a true statement. dairy farmers, in fact, all animal agriculture farmers treat their animals with respect and dignity. these animals are their life and blood, and of course their financial stability. they are going to care for their animals in the up-most care, if not then the animals wouldnt produce the product consumers want these days, and the farmer would not have a lively hood. its like a musician tossing their instrument on the ground after every use, a mistreatment of the instrument is not going to produce a quality sound and therefore their work would not be the highest quality possible. websites and articles like these rarely have their facts straight and does nothing but to scare consumers and hurt the agriculture industry that feeds us everyday.

Its already totally clear from the label that theres stuff in there that didnt come out of a mammary gland. If you have a characterizing flavoring ingredient (like chocolate), it may also include coloring, nutritive sweetener, emulsifiers, and stabilizers. Characterizing means in large print as part of the name. They want permission to make chocolate milk with non-nutritive sweetener without going into the details in the large print, i.e. in the primary name of the product. This has nothing to do with the ingredients list in small print. Because the current regulations dont permit low-calorie sweeteners as a possibly implied ingredient for flavored milk, they have to add additional wording to the large-print product name to explain the change. Their argument is that if they have to say Reduced calorie in large print, people will think it necessarily tastes worse. Maybe theyre right and this is scam to save cost because aspartame or sucralose are cheaper than corn syrup. You can argue about that. But it bears basically no relation to what the linked web site is raving about."

26729724925,"Natural News is a horrible site to use as a source. Half of their sources are conspiracy blogs and the other half are gross misreadings of poorly translated foreign research papers. Even when they cover something thats actually happening, their coverage is so divorced from reality its hilarious."
26729641597,"Natural news on the front page of politics is one of the least subtle indicators that this subreddit is in a dangerous place in terms of fact-checking, scrutiny and skepticism. Please, if anyone shares my concern, get in touch with me. "
26729560290,"Woah woah woah lets not white wash the entire dairy industry as having a single cohesive thought process. Not every dairy is out to get you. And lets find a source that isnt wearing tin foil hats. The FDA cracks down on raw milk producers because its often a *banned* practice- varies from state to state- and drinking that stuff is *dangerous.* I might do it if I myself milked the cows that morning, but its pretty disgusting when families buy this stuff thinking its better for them (hint: pasteurization is pretty benign. You might cook some of the nutrition out of milk in the pasteurization process but theres bigger fish to fry) only to discover they just shut down little Timmys liver. If you dont milk the damn cows yourself you *do not* know what conditions each batch is harvested in, and frankly while Im perpetuating a stereotype here, but the hippies that are into this stuff arent exactly the most dedicated to following rules and holding themselves to high standards. Source: Im a system administrator for a small chain dairy, and the food science guy who manages our QA will talk your damn head off about this stuff every chance he gets. Apparently it pays better than when he made beer. Go figs. "
26729735904,"come on, man. natural news has all the credibility and scientific rigor of weekly world news, without the entertainment factor. At least wwn has batboy."
26729684451,I stopped reading the article when it referenced INFOWARS LOL
26729520225,Im allergic to aspartame. Awesome.
26729628009,This article comes from a terrible source... 
26729681259,Snopes. That is all
26729884130,"Of course they will have to fucking label that it has aspartame in it, otherwise people with PKU who drink it will get very sick from drinking it. Naturalnews is one of the worst sources you could come up with, it is essentially a conspiracy theory website. The ads for colloidal silver in the right margin should raise some red flags."
26729791968,"The article linked [this](http://tv.naturalnews.com/v.asp?v=C463AA940B9AEBA5D294F87FF0716579) video in the article. I have never seen something blatantly trying to manipulate people through use of buzz words and slanted, non-scientific, speech. The way he flaunts the 1st amendment at the end sounds like he knows he is talking out the ass."
26729749074,"What the fuck, guys? Quit fucking upvoting Natural News! "
26729594968,naturalnews.com? Seriously? Id trust Soap Opera Digest more on science news than that site.
26729581534,naturalnews? Really? 
26729779278,"I opened this article and in about 10 seconds realized that it was hugely biased and not trying to hide its sensationalism, so I figured it probably wasnt very accurate even though I knew nothing about the subject. After about 5 minutes of research, I realized that they truth was very benign. Then I went to read the top comments and felt proud of reddit for calling them out with well reasoned facts. It helped restore my faith in internet commentary. Then I switched to new and I lost my faith again. It was the equivalent of the crazy email forwards I would get late 90s before Snopes was a thing saying that the government was going to start charging for emails. "
26729786701,"Please never post a link to Natural News here ever again. That website is manipulative, biased, full of errors, and just complete BS. Dont trust anything they say without verifying it at a reliable source first."
26729756354,"Oh, so we are just pretending like Natural News is a legitimate source for anything? Next are we going to have front page posts about how the Illuminati are controlling our thoughts through secret ingredients in girl scout cookies? How about some modicum of critical thought."
26729632070,If you want proof of the stupidity and gullibility of the average user of this subreddit - this story being upvoted is it.
26729858757,Downvoting based purely on the source being called Natural News.
26729863493,Natural News gets an automatic downvote from me. Not a trustworthy source 
26729607246,This is a ridiculous rumor. [FDA regulations require that any product containing aspartame carry a warning label for phenylketonurics.](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.804)
26729828801,"Natural News. Really? Are we going to upvote links from info-wars next? Natural News is a hive of scum and conspiracy with the ultimate goal of selling you some SCAM products. Negative or critical comments are censored on the site and articles are often uncited or are demonstrably false. http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/NaturalNews &gt;NaturalNews.com (formerly Newstarget) is a website founded by Mike the Health Ranger Adams. The site promotes almost every sort of medical woo known, though it specializes in vaccine denialism,[1] AIDS/HIV denial,[2] quack cancer medicine[3] and conspiracy theories about modern medicine.[4] Even other quacks think its a quack site.[5] The site has recently expanded its outlook to become an outlet for extreme environmentalism and conspiracy theorizing about Obama and gun control. If you cite NaturalNews on any matter whatsoever, you are almost certainly wrong."
26729436916,Pretty nuts if this has any bearing on the truth... 
26729490585,"Aspartame is the number one tested food product in the world and there has never been a connection made between it and negative health effects. So I honestly just dont care. EDIT: one of the most* (not necessarily the number one) tested. Also heres a link talking about the 200 scientific studies that have found aspartame safe and 100 different countries who agree. The FDA, JEFCA, and SCF all found aspartame to be safe to use. link: http://www.aspartame.org/"
26729549800,Does this mean that there are currently ingredients that are unlabeled ?
26729550134,"Does anyone besides me think that aspartame just tastes really bad? Besides the health issues and allergies some people have to it, I just cant get over the taste. Theres no way I would drink milk that had aspartame, I cant even stand to drink diet sodas"
26729567432,Nothing should be hidden.
26729573551,"Raw milk is not the safest, its the organic bunch going to extremes, but every ingredient should be labeled, and if raw milk is labeled as such, people should get the choice.The dairys selling it should be closely montored however.Nanny state interference in diet is going to far.aspartame is not a natural product at all, and should always be labeled.Unknown additives in milk are exactly the kind of thing that will drive parents towards unpasturised ,ie raw milk and its inherent health risks."
26729582649,"EDIT: Wow, this title is so fucking misleading."
26729585529,"Well, I already dont drink milk, so Im in the safe zone... But Im allergic to aspartame! In my previous days of milk drinking, something like this would have fucked me up real good."
26729589072,This is targeted squarely at young school children who dont know the difference between sugar and poison. Edit; to fucking quote the rationale
26729589344,"petitioners assert that consumers do not recognize milk -- including flavored milk -- as necessarily containing sugar. Accordingly, the petitioners state that milk flavored with non-nutritive sweeteners should be labeled as milk without further claims so that consumers can more easily identify its overall nutritional value. I get the impression that the milkman wants to add sweeteners to all kinds of milk to make it more appealing to kids. by using artificial sweeteners and simply calling it milk, rather than what it really is, they provide a healthy drink for kids. In my opinion, the milk ind is acting like the processed food industry, enhancing the flavor of their food to get the consumer addicted and using tricks like natural favors on the labelling. 60 mins did a piece similar to this where a company called givaudam tweaked flavors. anyway, artificial sweeteners do not help fight obesity or anything like that. "
26729590047,Aspartame tastes gross.
26729595907,This kind of stuff makes me sick!
26729596030,"And Im sure theyll get it, good luck everybody "
26729596967,Fuck aspertame. I will still be able to taste it.
26729597322,"Okay, so they want to be able to just call it regular milk and not diet milk... Isnt there an entire food industry based on reduced calorie foods? I feel like listing something this as regular milk and not promoting the Diet aspect would hurt sales? Im no Business major but...common sense?"
26729597870,"Try hard as you might, you cannot hide aspartame. I can taste that shit in anything. Tastes like crap."
26729598153,There is no way this will pass. There are people who are deathly allergic to phenylalanine. Unless they want thousands of lawsuits theyll stay in their fucking place. EDIT: Its called [Phenylketonuria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria)
26729601996,"Ive always been a daily milk drinker, skim milk even. Things like this make me reconsider that habit."
26729605172,I really hope this is fake or not real. Im allergic to Aspartame and if its not labled I could ... wait... Lets let them do it. the day after Id be rich
26729607982,"I love how the article starts out with, You probably already know that the FDA has declared war on raw milk and even helped fund and coordinate armed government raids against raw milk farmers and distributors. Nope actually I didnt know that. TIL. "
26729615311,What about people with sensitivities to aspartame? It gives my husband panic attacks and my friends mom goes into seizures.
26729618268,"Yea it triggers my migraine headaches, guess I wont be buying milk then"
26729618849,The whole asparthame causing cancer thing is a myth. Some lady who claimed to have a doctorate degree randomly started the rumor online with no evidence at all and for some reason it caught on. 
26729619086,"In small amounts, I dont think aspartame is that bad. When you consume it in huge quantities, it is probably quite bad, but it would be if you consumed lots of sugar too. Edit: http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/aspartame.asp"
26729623102,"Why would anyone read anything associated with that webpage? The article has been shown by other commenters to be extremely misleading, so Ill focus on the source -- read the top stories on that webpage from the past week, month, and year. They consist of conspiracy theories about how the Colorado shootings were a false flag, how Angelina Jolie either faked her removal or how BRCA1 is a huge corporate conspiracy, and how all sorts of common stuff cures everything. Apparently, lemons, honey, and ozone therapy (wtf?) all cure cancer, heart disease, diabetes, skin conditions, and help you lose weight. On the other hand, [listed in the 10 most unhealthy, cancer-causing foods](http://www.naturalnews.com/039970_cancer_junk_food_carcinogens.html) are things like GMO foods (with the source for their danger being a link to an article on their own webpage), microwave popcorn, and artificial sweeteners. What a bunch of unbelievable bullshit-- as a science educator, reading this webpage and the comments are mentally exhausting. Its really depressing."
26729623815,"Solution: stop drinking milk. Period. Humans are the only mammals that drink milk past infancy. And if thats not weird enough, were the only mammal that drink milk that comes from a different species."
26729625832,Good thing I dont eat dairy products. 
26729629312,"Itll never happen. Ever seen that label on diet soda that says Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine? If youre a Phenylketonuric, the phenylalanine in aspartame can FUCK YOU UP. Like make you retarded and shit. If this happened, it would be a ticking time bomb for a massive lawsuit."
26729630363,Can we just get naturalnews banned from /r/politics already?
26729632846,http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/05/aspartame_in_milk_why_the_dairy_industry_wants_to_sneak_artificial_sweeteners.html
26729636031,"Maybe Im just not being thorough enough, but I cant find the answer to my question: **What about just plain ole white milk (whole fat, 2%, and 1% included)? Will they start adding completely pointless artificial sweeteners to these?**"
26729637022,They lost me by using hyperbole. I know when someones trying to play me. 
26729637094,Remember that this article is written by the same guy who still believes that childhood vaccinations cause Autism
26729639177,"&gt;non-nutritive &amp;nbsp; &gt; youre working on that non-nutritive cereal varnish, arent you clark? &gt;Id like you to write something up for my presentation next week. Laymans terms, none of that inside jargon crap."
26729640848,Artificial sweeteners cause these problems of obesity and diabetes by tricking the body into expecting sugar. Putting it in milk will only make the problem worse. 
26729641810,Why would it be unlabeled? Why cant we make a chice what to put in our bodies?
26729641881,"Im allergic to aspartame. I hope they dont start hiding it in things, its a big deal to me. Ive thrown out more food than anything when I forget to check the label carefully enough already. Usually yogurt and drink mixes, they already seem to hide it pretty well in the list. If I accidentally have aspartame, I know it... it feels like someone is stabbing me in the throat with a rusty coat hangar, and twisting it."
26729651790,"I just want to say that Im drinking sugar free chocolate milk right now, and itd delicious. The milk really covers up the artificial flavor from the sweetener. If I was in charge of a school, I would see no reason to sell diabetes-milk over something that is delicious and healthy. People have issues with aspartame because theyre either allergic, or have an anti-science worldview. "
26729652073,"wouldnt people, you know, notice anyway? "
26729653534,"If milk isnt already one of the sweetest things you consume, there is a problem. Those promoting this secretive, unnecessary, artificial sweetening are scam artists and are full of shit. Any positive claims or pros lists attempting to purport this are completely contrived."
26729654219,I started poking around the website to get a sense of how bad everyone is saying it is- [this](http://www.naturalnews.com/040400_gene_patents_genetic_slavery_human_DNA.html) pretty much summed it up.
26729655567,"Please list the organizations name in the title! Simply calling them the US dairy industry is too broad. The article itself specifically names the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), the title should reflect that in some way. It makes no sense when people blame things on democrats, republicans, lobbyists, or (the one I hear most) the government. These are faceless organizations. Call each group; each person out by name. Tie them personally to what they are doing. This applies to so many situations other than this one. Please spread this practice. "
26729655603,"Many comments on the article and a few in this thread are criticizing the government for this, which is somewhat unfair at this stage. While I dont personally think milk with additives should be able to be called milk and not something like flavored milk, the procedure the FDA is using in this case is a part of the normal regulatory process. A group in the industry submitted a proposed regulation, it had a certain number of signatures, and the FDA put it out for public comment. This is an example of the system working. The FDA is not trying to sneak anything past us, they are simply saying, hey, some people want this regulation. Should we do it? If they get a lot of negative feedback, in particular if food safety experts and consumers make it clear that this is not a desirable regulation, it is very unlikely that this regulation would come to fruition. I guess Im just trying to say everyone take a breath, and if this is an issue you care about submit your concerns to the FDA."
26729659947,"That would be very bad, especially since my family and I are all allergic to aspertame, well have really bad reactions to it :/"
26729662852,Is aspartame good? No. Is this sensationalized? Yes. Is Natural News a sensationalist biased source with incorrect facts? Yes. 
26729663093,"The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ¡°the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional¡± (21CFR101.22)."
26729670173,"well, theres a link included in the article to send comments to the FDA. https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/02/20/2013-03835/flavored-milk-petition-to-amend-the-standard-of-identity-for-milk-and-17-additional-dairy-products "
26729672328,"I do not care, everything that is IN a product needs to be labeled for the consumer to be able to look for. Why doesnt milk just contain MILK?"
26729675106,&gt; You probably already know that the FDA has declared war on raw milk and even helped fund and coordinate armed government raids against raw milk farmers and distributors. WTF?
26729676304,You cant hide aspartame. As soon as that shit hits your tongue you realize what you have just been duped into drinking.
26729677801,wow if this happens then fuck off seriously. Might as well just say fuck it and not even care to make anything healthy anymore i mean fuck.
26729678421,The FDA is right up there with Monsanto. They are in bed with each other anyway. Time to start growing/producing our own food (until they make that illegal).

26729679456,"Regulatory capture is bad, mmmkay."
26729679528,"Natural news is a terrible source of information. Theyre like the left wing version of fox news, but somehow crazier."
26729682281,Umm no.
26729687867,"Nope. Just nope. Even though [aspartame isnt as dangerous as people thought](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17828671/), I would never argue to reduce the current level of labeling. "
26729688307,As someone who has a strong negative reaction to aspertame....I disapprove
26729688671,"On a rainy afternoon following a U.S. test, he quizzed Jerome Wiesner, the White House science adviser, about the contamination caused by nuclear explosions. How did the fallout return to earth from the atmosphere? ¡°It comes down in the rain,¡± Wiesner replied. The President stared out the window at the rain falling on his precious Rose Garden. ¡°You mean there might be radioactive contamination in that rain out there right now?¡± ¡°Possibly,¡± Wiesner said. After Wiesner left the office, Kennedy quietly sat in his chair for several minutes, looking at the rain falling on the garden. ¡°I never saw him more depressed,¡± recalled Ken O¡¯Donnell. "
26729689807,"1. Schools should not offer chocolate milk. If kids dont want regular milk, let them drink water. 2. Schools should not offer soda or fruit juice. Let the kids drink regular milk, which already contains a fair amount of carbs naturally or water. 3. Our society is addicted to carbohydrate rich foods. Dietary fatty acid intake is not the cause of the current diabetes and heart disease epidemics. Sugar, wheat and corn are."
26729693852,They need to teach their kids better. My boys associate healthy with being good food not yucky food.
26729698213,"Im Donny Rumsfeld, and I approve of this message"
26729700874,You actually linked to that rag natural news? I sorry but nothing on their site is credible.
26729702856,Artificial sweeteners dont taste good and if i cant avoid low calorie shit easily thats gonna be a hassle.
26729703669,I dont give a f about anything else. I just want the label to say clearly whats in it so I can read it for me and my family. 
26729704171,How about no milk becuse humans are the only mammal to drink it after weening 
26729705187,Am I the only one around here who detests packaged flavored milks because they add thickeners to them? In school I always took the plain milk for this reason. My kids are wild-eyed crazy sugar hounds and Im sure theyd never refuse flavored milk. It is what it is.
26729709769,"please dear god no, i cant STAND aspertame. I cant have anything with that in there. "
26729711919,"This is an effing joke, first of all this article is lying to you, it is illegal to give cows hormones and milk them for human consumption. 2nd it is even more illegal to milk cows for human consumption that have been treated with antibiotics within 7 days. this is more propaganda by Organic Enthusiasts to get people to stop drinking/eating conventional non organic dairy products. Ive worked on several dairy farms and have never and will never allow antibiotics into milk nor hormones to be processed for human consumption. I drink milk too people! Also if your milk wasnt pasteurized it would cost 20-50 dollars a gallon and would expire in a matter of hours."
26729720643,Not labeling aspartame content can be **lethal** to phenyloketuronics.
26729737836,America. The only developed country in the world were the kids are so fucking fat by 3rd grade companies struggle on how to market to kids. 
26729737885,Why should any food product ever get such an exemption? No good can come of it.
26729738537,"Considering the source I know its probably bunk, but food labeling is a problem. No one is held to a specific terminology and a lot of companies dance around naming their ingredients. Its not cool watching my roommate almost go into anaphylactic shock in the kitchen because the ingredient listed was some new name for aspartame."
26729738901,"The problem is many things, but one important factor are Phenylketonurics. Because Aspartame is made from the Amino Acid Phenylalanine, Phenylketonurics are not able to digest it, causing adverse health effects such as brain damage."
26729740141,How do I hide all posts from Natural News?
26729740654,nothing will be done by anyone.
26729745476,Wait... in the US corporations arent required to properly label their food?
26729748454,thank goodness i stopped drinking milk a few years back. no suger either that stuff is poison. natural honey is the way to go 
26729751604,"Kids love milk. Milk costs more than pop. Kids love pop. Parents dont have a lot of money. Consequence: Pop is more readily available. I dont know about you, but I grew up loving milk. We never had enough and always needed more. Our income was always below national poverty levels and milk never became cheaper, even with the taxes not applied to it (as a staple product in canada). I hope that one day milk is cheaper than cola. I could live off just milk and day old pizza...mmmmmm"
26729751641,This article has inspired me to never drink milk ever again!...said no one ever.
26729762314,only reason you would want this not on the label is if you intend to abuse it. dont get companies that operate this way. makes me wonder what else is unlabeled.
26729771432,That would be horrible. Fianc¨¦ is allergic to aspartame.
26729784157,Some people are allergic to aspartame. So now you cant drink milk if youre allergic to aspartame. Oh wait theyll come out with some new form of milk that doesnt have aspartame and charge more for it.
26729784415,"If the applicants are so certain there is nothing wrong with aspartame, let them put it on the label. If they dont like the publics reaction to seeing the word aspartame on the ingredients list, thats a marketing challenge, not a regulatory one. "
26729793269,"While I dont buy into the anti-aspartame hysteria, I definitely dont like hidden, unlabeled additives in my food."
26729797961,Aspartame tastes like shit. You start putting that shit in milk and Ill stop drinking it.
26729806342,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame#Phenylalanine_and_phenylketonuria Milk already contains some phenylalanine, adding more could make for a quite hazardous food if you have the genetic mutation that causes PKU. This is not only dumb...its downright reckless endangerment."
26729806934,Syrian refugees hate aspartame in their milk.
26729810724,Tip all the cows!
26729813036,ITT: Woefully delusional victims with something resembling Stockholm syndrome tell you how much they love being poisoned and getting fucked
26729814198,Aspartame is some NASTY tasting stuff. I cant eat or drink anything with it as an ingredient because it just linkers in my mouth. Its worse than being locked in the car with a fart.
26729821109,Aspartame is just as bad as sugar for the kids teeth and it stimulate them more than sugar. Nothing some added fluoride and Ritalin cant fix though. 
26729821544,"For those of you who havent heard it, you may be disgusted by the way Aspartame was initially approved by the FDA in the first place. It involved none other than former Secretary of Defense, [Donald Rumsfeld](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robbie-gennet/donald-rumsfeld-and-the-s_b_805581.html). "
26729834988,"Natural News is a HUGE PILE OF HIPPIE CONSPIRACY GOBSHITE. BAD R/POLITICS Seriously, fuck this shit."
26729843763,The last thing we need is a cover-up for Aspartame! Its bad enough food companies can legally put Natural Flavorings on the ingredients and not have to tell what synthetic garbage that really consists of. Natural my a$$.
26729845921,Aspartame is not good for health and youd have to be fucking retarded to knowingly consume it.
26729846900,STOP UPVOTING NATURALNEWS YOU IDIOTS
26729854845,First off if you are defending this bill because you think kids are getting fat off milk you are retarded. They get fat off the shit food they eat at home. Anyway they should be required to list their ingredients just like everyone else. 
26729858217,Cant we just leave milk as milk? The fuck.
26729859942,"I dont know whats funnier, the braindead idiots who think aspartame is something they should put in their body Or the thread with all the idiots who thought GMOs were something they should put in their body If you dont care about getting fucked, why should I care for you? Bon apetit"
26729865250,"Well cow milk already has pus and shit in it, so why not add this. Yeah, drinking another species breast milk ... is not a bit weird at all. "
26729866432,Ive noticed an opposite happening in the UK. Our products quite proudly say No artificial sweetenerson the package... whats wrong with a little sugar in moderation anyway?
26729871853,thank god aspartame is so healthy! ...
26729873014,"Yum. I always like a little military-grade neurotoxin in my foodstuffs. Gives it that extra zi- (ow, why does my head hurt?... whaddyamean ive got a fuckin tumor?!)..."

26729874131,Naturalnews? really?
26729879489,WHAT? OH MY LAWD!!! THAT IS BLASPHEMOUS!!
26729881233,Yet another chemical in our food that we know is bad for our bodies long term. This is absolute bullshit 
26729895082,"Im really tired of all the bullshit around aspartame, find me one...one peer-reviewed published link that concludes it causes cancer. Anyone."

26729908784,Drink almond milk.
26729909095,"1) I thought aspartame causes severe allergic reactions. Thats why the can says warning, this contains phenelketelneurics or something like that. 2) Aspartame is also a laxative. The kids who decides to only drink chocolate milk might be in for a surprise. "
26729917643,"IF this is true...then it has to be stopped. I dont know everything there is to know about aspartame, only what ive read and heard from both reliable and unreliable sources, but im sure there is still people looking in to whether its very dangerous.

This has nothing to do with whether or not it can be an ingredient, or whether or not its labeled as an ingredient. But so many people are just reading the title then getting outraged. It would be like if someone posted an article saying the government was thinking of allowing how fructose corn syrup as an ingredient in food. If youre that opposed to aspartame, then just dont drink low calorie chocolate milk. Simple as that."

If I buy something that says low calories, or no calories, I check the label.

So while I may not control the air I breathe or the water I bathe in I do have 100% say in what I eat. The idea that stuff I am trying to avoid can be added and *not labeled* really makes it impossible for me to eat anything I dont grow or ranch myself.

When people as diverse as Noam Chomsky and Pat Buchanan are virulently against it, but the bipartisan crooks in DC are pushing to Fast Track it through by keeping the contents a secret and having no debate - you know its a treaty that is not in the interests of Americans. Ross Perot was exactly correct when he famously told America in the 1992 presidential debate there is going to be a giant sucking sound of US jobs heading south. Ross Perot was talking about NAFTA. TPP has been described as NAFTA on steroids. TPP sets up a system where Corporations can sue local taxpayers if a government brings in any law or regulation that hurts Corporate profits (or existing laws do). So that is any law or regulation that protects the rights or the living standards of the people over profiteering by Corporations. So pretty much anything. The settlements are expected to run into the billions. The treaty will make it very difficult for any country to effectively regulate or otherwise control international banks.

26877656839,The public option was the will of the people. The ACA was the will of the Democrats and the private insurance companies.
26877737605,"I really enjoyed reading that poll that came out last week that said 46% of Americans are against Obamacare but the second question in that poll was are you opposed to the Affordable Care Act, and 36% said they were opposed to it. What the congressional GOP is doing is misinforming people about the law, and polls like that are proof of it. Obamacare was a republican idea in the early 90s. Im pretty sure they oppose it because of their undying spite of seeing Obama in the whitehouse and has very little to do with the legislation. They are proving that they are willing to drive the country off a cliff in order to oppose and undermine the president. Sounds pretty childish and that the GOP are just a bunch of sore losers. I hope Obama calls their bluff and Im pretty sure he will"
26877900164,Because its a manifestation of business interests -- illustrating perfectly the corporatism in the United States. The idea that its being touted as some paradigm of democratic legislative action is absurd. 
26877611536,"True, but if people hold out for legislation that will completely and finally fix an ENORMOUS problem in one fell swoop, youre going to be waiting a *long* time. Especially if that solution involves fundamentally changing the way things operate from the very top to the very bottom in this country. The ACA may not be perfect, but it does do a lot of good things that people agree with. And apart from the things that are actually in the law itself, it does three more things that are of the utmost importance: 1) it affirms that healthcare is a right, not a privilege. 2) it sets in the minds of Americans that 100% healthcare coverage is the ultimate goal. 3) it gets Americans used to the idea of having the government involved in healthcare in any capacity, however limited. Those are no small feats, considering the status quo, so you shouldnt trivialize it because it isnt perfect. What this does is incrementally fix the problem while changing the mindset of Americans so as to open the door for more permanent and better solutions in the future. "

BTW, todays Obamacare (i.e. the ACA) is not the same Obamacare (which was a universal healthcare system) that liberals wanted. You basically have a health insurance mandate (much like a car insurance mandate), and can be penalized financially via taxes if you dont have it. There are people out there that actually believe that health insurance will be provided to them now. The Supreme Court once again overstepped their judicial boundaries by upholding in under the Tax Clause. If you believe in their argumentation, you will love their BS in Wickard v. Filburn. Here is the bad thing about democracy (majority opinion): it is not always right, it is just what most people want (and in some cases, it is not even most in the strictest sense of the word). "

26877835299,"&gt; in what manner was the will of the people disregarded? Uh... everywhere else? And the people didnt want this Obamacare horseshit, they wanted universal healthcare. But then the big insurance companies would become obsolete, so it didnt happen, nor will it."

26877635361,"Kind of a silly question, seeing as how the will of the people has been disregarded for decades now."
26877740029,Replaced Obamacare with PATRIOT act. Would you still make the same argument?
26877581171,"If they had the will of the people on their side, theyd be able to pass a clean bill defunding Obamacare. They wouldnt have to attach it to the budget and threaten a government shutdown. If they had the will of the people then the Republican house would pass a bill, which would be approved by the Republican Senate, and then President Romney would sign it into law. Thats not how it is. They need to get with reality. "
26877649277,"First, I want to say that the ACA wasnt what I wanted. It didnt go far enough, but in my eyes its better than nothing. Here are my problems with the left-wing talking points regarding the fight over the ACA: 1. The way it was passed was not ideal. Straight down party lines, on a budget vote. How can Republicans be criticized for trying to defund it in a similar way that the ACA was passed in the first place? 2. Polls show pretty consistently that its not a popular law. You can argue that the public is just not educated on the subject, and there is a lot of misinformation about the ACA, but the poll numbers are consistent. 3. I voted for Obama twice, but I wasnt really voting FOR Obama, but AGAINST the opposition. Although, I did want to give Obama a chance the first time, I voted for him the second time because the thought of President Romney is still deeply horrifying to me. I didnt vote for Obama because of the ACA and there is simply no reason to believe that Obama was re-elected purely because of the ACA. Are Republicans being ridiculous? Of course. The sky is not falling, the ACA isnt going to crash the economy. And in fact, the Republican Party is a bigger danger to the economy than the ACA could ever be. Still, Im looking forward to seeing what the health care exchanges have to offer tomorrow, but I really wanted either the public option, or universal coverage. "
26877682426,"Well personally I dont like the law because it keeps all the health care profit barons in business. So we might see a 20% drop in premiums but what we should keep in mind is that we as a nation are still paying 5 times more for health care than other developed nations with universal health care and by most measures are getting inferior health care. That 20% drop doesnt sound so good anymore now does it? How did we get this abomination of a health care law? The answer of course comes down to the influence of money in our politics. Neither dems or reps were willing to lose out on the huge stacks of cash they get from groups like the AMA, health care giants, or especially the health insurance lobby. But hey, I guess its kind of a step in the right direction, but just barely. Edit: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems Here you can see US down at number 37 right around such beacons of prosperity as Slovenia, Dominica, and Cuba. Conveniently they have a per capita expenditure ranking as well and as you can see we are number 1! Go USA! Oh...wait...that just means we have the least efficient health care system in the world. But seriously, a few % off our premiums is nowhere near enough to change this picture in any significant way. We need universal health care."
26878069373,"We werent. And it pisses me off to hear Obamacare doesnt work, when that shit hasnt started yet and doesnt until Jan 1, 2014. "
26877649780,"To play devils advocate, Just because someone is elected doesnt necessarily mean you agree with everything they do. I dont recall voting on ACA/Obamacare directly. Congress passed the patriot act &amp; NSA powers, the president signed it, the FISA upheld it, After evidence showing he supports these programs Obama was reelected. So in what manner was the will of the people disregarded? It goes both ways. Because of all of those things does that mean that the NSA spying is the will of the people? Not necessarily and in that case it seems to be the exact opposite. "
26877538685,"Smart Americans want single payer. Folks who believe in unbridled capitalism dont understand that a) fewer tax dollars are spent on health care in countries with socialized medicine, b) because government sets rates medical companies cant get away with a 4000% markup on saline and c) its in their own economic interest. Republicans are taking money from insurance lobbyists hand over fist for fighting Obamacare. GOP and Tea Party voters dont have the education necessary to vote intelligently.

26877641529,Regarding drug laws...no one ever asked us. This is one of those rare issues in which there is bipartisan support - but in direct opposition to what a majority of Americans want. Weve never even come close to a bill rewriting our drug policies on a federal level. 
26877592563,"The trouble with the right in this country is that they solely believe in outcomes and have no respect for the process itself, which is actually far more important."
26877593230,"The sad thing about this bill is that it does not accomplish what most Americans think it does. It is not universal healthcare, but universal insurance. It does nothing for the actual cost of healthcare which is the primary issue in this country. Instead, it forces insurance premiums on anyone that isnt covered in one way or another. Even with subsidies, people that couldnt afford insurance previously will have to scrape by. The real issue is that even though they have insurance, there is still a high deductible that needs to be met to see any real benefit (for covered items). So unless a person has a catastrophic illness/accident, they will only have to pay ~$10,000 instead of ~$100,000+ For someone at the poverty line, that is still too much money to pay. EDIT - Thats just a tiny piece. There are 2000+ more pages of other stipulations and what-not."

26877628826,It wasnt. Republicans simply dont want healthcare to be a democratic achievement. They were stupid enough to brand it Obamacare and now its going to bite them in the ass.
26877629574,"The fact people think this is the solution to a broken system shows the profound ignorance. They started taking money out of my check LAST February, I am already down a thousand dollars and still pay for my own health care. Looking at the plans in my state, I couldnt save money by using obamacare, so whether I use it or not I lose $75 a month. Nothing in life is free, the middle class has paid for nearly everything and this is just another straw heaped on our backs.

26877637165,"If this shit is good enough for the people, then the Congress, unions and everyone else needs to be in it. "
26877638849,"It *has* been disregarded. Just because there is an asterik that has to be attached doesnt mean it is blatantly false, its just a lie by omission. Lets not forget that if the house of representatives was elected via a popular vote nationwide (same as the senate) that the democrats would have held a majority in both. It is only due to gerrymandering that the republicans were able to hold onto the house. [Politifact did a piece on it.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/) The fact remains that they are using the maintained majority in the house of representatives to say most people agree with us since representatives are elected more often. It is cherry-picking evidence at its worst because not only are they selecting one location of data (the majority in the house of representatives), they have through gerrymandering been able to skew the actual intent of the people. There are ways that a slight difference could be made between the popular vote and the actual end result that isnt attributed to gerrymandering, such as high population states having more turnout for one party than the other, and thus winners of the democrats would get a boost in total popular vote without any additional seats. However, it is rare that this happens and even worse - there is a significant majority in the house rather than the very close that would be suggested if a single candidate just had good turnout. What sickens me is that the *majority* of the issues that are currently being had would be completely, absolutely and totally invalidated by having a proper representation of the peoples will in the house. We can argue all day about whether or not that would be best for this country - but we would not have the house trying to have a standoff with the president over every little thing if the republicans hadnt gerrymandered it. So, while even the devil can quote scripture and the republicans saying that the will of the people has been disregarded is actually *true*, it is that the will of the people was to reelect and give a majority back to the democrats in the house and that they instead thwarted that will of the people and ended up getting themselves a majority and now were seeing the results. *Note:* I understand and believe that either party would willfully engage in the process of gerrymandering. I do not think this is a republican only issue. However the republicans are the ones currently benefitting the most from it. We need to change to a slightly different model in order to avoid these sorts of issues. It is degrading the ability of congress to actually implement the will of the people and is allowing money and greed to trump democracy. TL;DR: They are correct - the will of the people has been disregarded. But not about Obamacare (the ACA) or the debt ceiling or anything like that. The house should have a plurality of democrats in it if popular vote is any indication, and at minimum the majority should be very, very slim."
26877641073,"Eh, I dont necessarily see it as disregarding the will of the people, since they are elected officials and are technically playing within the framework of the system. That said, I would say that the system needs to change to stop these loophole abuses."

The deck is stacked for the rich and big business, and they are more contemptuous of the average american citizen than ever before. "
26877659204,"90% of people polled are in favor of background checks for buying a gun. Those arent Real Americans, so the Republicans can ignore them. 30% of people polled want to abolish Obamacare. Those are Real Americans, so their opinion carries more weight than the majority. "
26877660261,the 1%
26877660897,Why would any law maker in their right mind be against universal health care? How does that makes sense?
26877662877,"Living in one of the big bad socialist countries (Denmark) it dumbfounds me how anyone can be against this. Great countries -need- healthy and well educated people, and the things we all use at some point in life (daycare, schools, healthcare, nursing homes etc) we might as well all chip in on via taxes."
26877664831,My guess is that the Republicans hate the idea that Obama will go down in history as THE president that created the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare is a nasty word for them.

26877666739,"If you live in the conservative Fox News bubble, you will think that everyone is a psychotic Randian theocrat, as ironic as that is. Mittens actually thought he was going to win the election, by a landslide. "
26877671093,"Show me a poll in which people support Obamacare. The point being, Obamacare didnt win his second term because of it, he won his second term despite it. Also, remember the bloody post-Obamacare House elections? These republicans were put into office to fight Obamacare, and thats what theyre doing. "
26877672665,"It was passed in a backdoor fashion, the Supreme Court upheld the mandate as a tax rather than the way it was argued and the President was reelected on more than one factor, not just the ACA. Its not a cut and dry as you think. "
26877672685,"I dont like it. See, will of the people."
26877672819,I wonder if the republicans will want the name Obamacare removed once it is successful.
26877672935,"It goes both ways. We all want reform, we all want the same thing. I dont believe one side is more at fault than the other. Its a no-win situation. "
26877672970,"I think its the fact that union groups like the teamsters are against it and now other unions and the senators are getting exceptions to the act really concerns me and others. If the middle class has to front the bill for everyones health care the economy will be irreparably damaged. The fact is it isnt structured like the working ones (ex) Canada , Great Britain. Im all for universal health care but everyone has to participate in the ultimate funding or it wont work. The working programs in other countries are highly regulated hopefully the administration fixes the rampant amount of fraud going on with these programs and gets the money and care to the people who need it. Only time will tell, but you have to let it happen first."
26877673092,Fallacy. You assume that his being reelected is an indication of support for this issue. Obama supports many different issues. 
26877673253,"One MAJOR point this country was founded on was the government NEVER being able to force you to buy anything. And thats exactly what this is. If people want to be ignorant and not have health care, then thats their right, who the hell is anyone to say different and force them to buy something?"
26877673366,"will of the people... aka mob rule. 51% of the population should never force the other 49% of people into ANYTHING. regardless of how beneficial and benevolent the means or ends are, its still force. "
26877673760,"Segregation was also upheld by the Supreme Court. Should that have been accepted even today? Before Butthurt, I voted for Obama and I am disappointed by what he has done, failed to do and see him as a Plinko President. He drops the coins down and hopes they fall into the right place."
26877673975,in this title it doesnt mention anything in relation to the peoples will other than they didnt want a scumbag like Romney in office. Just because someone gets elected does NOT mean the will of the people is 100% behind them.
26877674136,Do you think 50% +1 = the will of the people?
26877674269,"Its only the will of fraudulent voters, who by definition are people who Republicans would rather not allow to vote."
26877675336,People are dumb and think it should be free. They are too stupid to realize that Canadians actually pay a shit ton for it in taxes. So if you tell em they will be taxed for it. They lose their shit because its free everywhere else. Sure. 
26877675554,"Because its socialism and wealth redistribution. More taxes and penalties on the middle class, therefore making the rich richer and the poor poorer."
26877675680,"I think it was because it was 1000+ pages and almost nobody knew what was in it, and when you did read it, there were a lot of earmarks in there for things unrelated to healthcare. Some politicians took advantage of this and any arguments against it were you just dont care about people.. It was politics as usual and turned a lot of people off. "
26877677236,The people also reelected a GOP majority in the House and the GOP reps ran against Obamacare. 
26877677318,"To answer the OP, the Supreme Court doesnt really represent the will of the people."
26877677746,Id love to know the percentage of voters that are even aware of either candidates politics. 
26877678738,"I don¡¯t think the politicians understand how much harm they are doing to our country we are the most powerful nation in the world and yet we look like bickering children who can¡¯t keep their affairs in order. I never agreed with the GOP agenda but until recently I never believed they would allow their ideology to really hurt the country it¡¯s sad and disheartening. This is a Republican boondoggle, the GOP are to blame and no one else. Americans need and want their government to run smoothly, the congress needs to learn to compromise and do their job effectively. To me random government shutdowns means someone in Washington is not doing their job and needs to be replaced."
26877678904,Its the largest legislation ever passed with no support from the opposing party whatsoever. And now the opposing party is doing all it can to de-fund the legislation. Are you surprised? Have you never heard of democracy?
26877679021,"This is just my opinion. I find that any politician making a claim about the ACA, and then turning around and say that they need more time to read and study it is clearly incompetent. Ive seen and been part of personal arguments that mirror back the bullshit excuse of TL;DR. As of now, theyve had over 3 years to read and understand the damn thing, so making the ACA this hidden and evil mystery is so laughable that I can only continue to shake my head at that kind of whining from any political party. So far, Ive only heard of attempts to delay it, repeal it, or change it to limit birth control even more. And the only excuses Ive heard is that its evil, immoral, and TL;DR. W. T. F. Can anyone tell me whats so evil about it that will harm more than help with text and accurate references from the actual bill to back it up? I hope that theres responses beyond personal religious sensibilities that are not forced on anyone and tl;dr, because those ideas need to be applied to improve the already signed into law bill."
26877679408,He didnt say *Which* peoples will.
26877681371,Replace Obama and Obamacare with Bush and The Patriot act and take another shot at telling me this is a valid argument to make. 
26877681381,"I really have no idea how Obamacare will affect me, can anyone give me a good place to go so I can get educated? Ive Googled but Im not sure which one would be best. Thanks in advance."
26877682750,"No, but see, its taxation without representation, because we dont get to vote for the elected individuals who passed the ACA into law, and instead those decisions are all made for us in the House of Lords over in England. "
26877683032,It doesnt go far enough. Just extend Medicare as an option for all Americans. It would be cheaper and we know it works. The ACA just seems to create a large windfall for health insurance corporations. 
26877684480,"Why stop at ACA, here are some other promises that he campaigned on: * We reject the use of national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. And: We support constitutional protections and judicial oversight on any surveillance program involving Americans. * We will close the detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years. * We will revisit the Patriot Act and overturn unconstitutional executive decisions issued during the past eight years. * We will not use signing statements to nullify or undermine duly enacted law. * Often the best source about waste, fraud and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism . . . should be encouraged rather than stifled. * Eliminating special tax breaks for oil and gas companies: including repealing special expensing rules, foreign tax credit benefits, and manufacturing deductions for oil and gas firms. * Congress has set rules regarding the tax deductibility of the salaries of CEOs, but forms of non-salary compensation have become popular. Obama would look at revamping definitions of compensation. * Will eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year. This will eliminate taxes for 7 million seniors -- saving them an average of $1,400 a year-- and will also mean that 27 million seniors will not need to file an income tax return at all. * Will address the infrastructure challenge by creating a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank to expand and enhance, not supplant, existing federal transportation investments. This independent entity will be directed to invest in our nations most challenging transportation infrastructure needs. The Bank will receive an infusion of federal money, $60 billion over 10 years, to provide financing to transportation infrastructure projects across the nation. These projects will create up to two million new direct and indirect jobs and stimulate approximately $35 billion per year in new economic activity. * Allow Americans to buy their medicines from other developed countries if the drugs are safe and prices are lower outside the U.S. * Will provide the CDC $50 million in new funding to determine the most effective approaches that assist not only navigation of cancer patients through diagnosis and treatment processes, but also provide easy-to-understand information on the necessary follow-up steps to ensure continued lifelong health. ..."
26877685025,"The will of a tiny, sniveling group of sore-loser assholes, who dont necessarily oppose healthcare reform, but *very much* oppose a black President having any kind of lasting legacy on American society. Thats the bottom line."
26877685052,"Thats a very good point. It is law. So why the delays and exemptions, which are in fact changes to the law? Should a president or his/her administration be able to change a law without a vote? "
26877686437,I would love for any lib to answer me one question tho. If the ACA is a good thing then why did the senators themselves push to be excluded from it?
26877686490,"Its a step in the right direction, but for now all it really does is force all the young healthy people to start giving money to the pharmaceutical companies. "

26877688573,"conservatives live in a self-reinforcing echo chamber, socially and media-wise reality doesnt have anything to do with their passion, convictions or beliefs "
26877689450,"A big chunk of the country does not want/need all the bullshit that this will ruin, also its easy to get shit passed when you have over half the government getting paid by the same people who are passing the bills. There is no room for rational discourse since you have to support those who will keep paying you and never let you get fired."
26877690140,Does the will of the people include a bill being slammed through congress? Passed by a democrat controlled house and senate? A bill that even the speaker of the house at the time stated even she didnt read it. Oh yeah the Will of the people and Im pretty sure Obama didnt win a second term running on the idea of Obama care. 
26877690186,"I was fine with it until there was a mandate, now I will have to drop my current plan and get a different one to afford it. For my family this is terrible. edit: whats to downvote? i dont deserve a choice?"
26877690210,"Every time I see Boehner doing his will of the people soundbite, I want to smack the lie out of his mouth. The President ran his re-election campaign in large part on Obamacare, Romney ran opposed - the **PEOPLE** went with Obama &amp; his care. And it wasnt even CLOSE: 4.9 million over Mittens. The Senate had 21 Democratic seats up for grabs, yet the PEOPLE not only left them in power but also added 2 more seats to their majority. In the House, not only did the GOP lose seats they came within 17 seats of losing control. But the biggest indication of the Peoples Will is that 1.7 million more voters went with Democratic candidates than with Republican. So, yeah, Mr. Speaker, the People of United States have sent you a message: STFU. "
26877690490,"The Republicans are scared shitless that the Affordable Care Act will be a success. Because if they fail and the ACA is successful the Republicans are doomed. They have campaigned for 3 straight years on repealing the ACA. If it turns out to be successful they are screwed. They wont have a policy to stand on. They will be demolished in 2014 and lose again in 2016. They have no choice but to dig their heels in right here right now and hope that the ACA is never fully implemented. And theyve picked a damn good time to have the fight. 14 months until Congressional re-elections, no real risk of losing the House, and a decent chance of grabbing a few more seats in the Senate. Bastards."
26877690920,"Because he lied about it. People elected him on what they thought Obamacare would be, but he was lying and now the people dont want it anymore. He sold it with lines like We will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan. Period. but that turned out to be false."
26877692911,"in the same manner that a mob cant vote to massacre a group of people, you cant vote to fine people just for existing which is what obamacare does"
26877694336,"Its a joke hes got bigger fish to fry how about helping Americans get jobs instead of pushing this ineffective, not to mention expensive agenda... Everyone will be healthy with no jobs! He keeps switching agendas when his current one goes bad and when it does and blames it on someone else but Im sure hes happy to take full credit for this... Better question is how many people actually want it? "
26877694629,"This reminds me of the Canadian version of Breaking Bad they tried to make. A high school chemistry teacher is diagnosed with cancer. He receives world class treatment in a timely manner that he does not have to pay out of pocket for thanks to Canadian Medicare, and he is able to continue teaching and supporting his family. The first episode was also the last. "
26877695078,"The will of the people was disregarded because it isnt the Universal Healthcare that it was sold as initially. Seems to me, and I could be wrong, but that this was some big ploy to get insurers more customers. Now everyone is mandated to get insurance, or pay a fine. That doesnt do anything but line certain peoples pockets, either with enforced insurance or with fees and penalties. There is no universal option and now people are basically coerced into purchasing it from the existing insurers. Its not as if it actually insured anyone who couldnt afford it, it basically now makes them pay for something they cant, otherwise they are fined. So this doesnt really solve anything, but it makes the insurance companies a but load more money and the people who hold out will make the government money through fines. Now maybe my understanding of this is completely flawed, but this is what seems to be the case to me. Can someone please let me know if this is in fact a correct assumption, and if not, correct me as far as the details?"
26877696773,"These are the same asshats who refuse to believe science, so yeah, logic isnt exactly their strong suit."
26877697822,I suppose you can say the same about prohibition.
26877697849,"Half the country knows nothing about the ACA and is against it for knee jerk reasons that fox news fed them. Its cool if you know what youre talking about and disagree with it, people have different views and that is a good thing but most anyone Ive come across that are anti Obamacare has no idea what it actually is. As of the 1st of the year I can afford Kaiser healthcare for me and my family. Not a weird government run health insurance, THE SAME plan they offer now, only affordable. All I gotta look out for is those damn nazi death panels. /sarcasm "
26877698223,"The will of the corporate people count as people, mere citizens are just walking votes, to be lied to as needed."
26877699934,"Up to this point, the will of the people HAS been disregarded: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html"
26877700215,"Ok, how about this: No subsidies for Government workers at Capitol Hill...currently they will receive a 80% taxpayer funded subsidy towards their Healthcare. No Subsidies for Congress or the House on THEIR Healthcare...let them find their Health Insurance on the Exchanges...just like the rest of us. Employers are exempted from ACA until 2015...lets do this exemption for the INDIVIDUAL too, NO penalties (which are called TAXES, HENCE the Supreme Courts decision) if your Employer doesnt contribute (like MY Employer doesnt either). ...lets see if Democrats vote YES for that...defend ALL THE EXEMPTIONS that others get, but YOU dont, as a regular person. btw...WHY wont the UNIONS get behind the ACA? They said that Employers dont hire Full-time (only Part Timers) anymore, so they dont have to abide to the Employer Mandate starting 2015. Riddle me all of this, thanks!"
26877700364,Lets please try to refer to the law as the Affordable Care Act or the ACA. Referring to it as Obamacare just play into the hands of the critics.
26877700529,"The republicans are so focused on making people suffer.. there is no other explanation. They oppose healthcare to end suffering of millions, so they shut down the government and cause more suffering. WTF? Vote these assholes out!"
26877700600,"The fact that they passed it without reading it, and then exempted themselves. Also, the fact that it turned out to be really not that affordable--as a North Carolinian, my premiums have already gone up quite a bit, and Im scared that my employer will drop me, leaving my wife and eight-month-old daughter without any health insurance."
26877700721,Can some-one explain why Obamacare is different than healthcare in Holland or in Denmark (where it is free)?
26877701140,Wasnt there an entire thread about all the negative effects of obamacare? like the limits on prices being removed from critical medications so pharmas could charge whatever they wanted?
26877701512,because fox news pundits say so!
26877701955,Cause the inherent flaw of democracy is that a vocal minority can make a big stink about something the majority put in place. 
26877702747,"Its all happening so gradually, I wonder if well ever get to a Bastille."
26877704646,"At this point, its a little late to be debating the will of the people. I mean the ACA has been passed and upheld, and now it is law that it be funded. You dont get to do polls and reassess at every step of the way. "
26877705530,"Maybe Im just not a team player but I cant honestly understand why theres not more decent amongst democrats about the ACA than there is. I voted for Obama the first time when he said he was going to do things a lot differently than what actually happened. What we got with the ACA though is just garbage compared to what we were promised. People are losing working hours and being moved to part time just so employers can get out of paying for their insurance. A convenient loophole that congress just so happened to not think about. This isnt even hyperbole as it happened to me and the rest of the staff where I worked. So now Im getting payed less and Im going to either have to pay a fine or buy some insurance plan that literally wont pay for itself unless something catastrophic happens with what little I have. I dont get it when people say well its better than if we did nothing because if we had done nothing Id still be full time and Id be able to afford insurance. Dont dismiss me because I disagree with you, I just dont want to be told that this is what I wanted when I voted for healthcare reform."
26877705537,"well.. dem here and obama supporter. a majority dont like obamacare. but a majority dont want it defunded. if you look into the numbers of the majority who dont like obamacare.. a large amount of those folks dont think it is left wing enough also if you look into the numbers, you will see a very large portion of people who dont like Obamacare, dont like it based on lies they heard on fox news. One of the big ones is 50% of everyone over 65 thinks that Obamacare increased their costs during the doughnut hole rather than reality which is he got rid of the doughnut hole for just about all of them. A large number think their medicare was cut to pay for obamacare, when in reality not a single thing was cut.. services were actually expanded, we negotiated a better deal with providers. when these people learn the truth, their support will flip on a dime. last support increases dramatically for Obamacare, especially from republicans if you call it by its real name, the affordable care act. See The term Obama has been successfully demonized by the right."
26877705876,"Im sure someone has already mentioned this (right?) but the basic explanation/rationale seems simple: In our system we basically have to pick between two people (and their parties) in each election. We might not agree with everything they support. So, for instance, if LGBT rights are important to me, Obama DID end DADT, so even if I dont support the ACA*, I would vote for Obama. The republican system of government is not a direct democracy, and it happens fairly often that the will of the people is not represented, because of the limited effect of electing officials can have. This is by design; there was considerable concern among the founding fathers about mob rule and the tyranny of the majority - this is partially, for instance, why the electoral college system exists - in case the average citizen votes for some fanatic, cooler heads might prevail and prevent that. (Thats the *theory*.) Its quite possible that Health Care Reform, is a disliked portion of a generally liked Democratic Party Platform. Since its core to their platform, however, they cant just say Eh, people dont like it, since that would be letting the republicans score points. Of course I havent looked at the poll numbers, but Im saying this to illustrate that just because a party is elected does not mean ALL their positions are popular. I think we can all think of some positions politicians are loathe to take, even if they are highly popular; the two party system almost guarantees that will happen on some issues). Of course, what is the true will of the people is so vague and inherently contentious that its almost impossible to find reliable information about it - polling can be contaminated in countless ways from the phrasing of questions to bad sampling. The perception we have as individuals is heavily marked by the environments we inhabit and the people we socialize with. (*:I hope you dont mind the acronym for Affordable Care Act, rather than the slightly loaded term Obamacare)"
26877707150,"These guys are truly in denial. Ive heard several times recently the ACA referred to as the healthcare bill, as if it was still up for debate and hasnt been the law of the land for two years. Idiots."
26877711111,Maybe because our entire system is corrupt to the core? Universal healthcare is very reasonable but it needs to be done right. We waste such enormous amounts of money on ridiculous things. 
26877711517,"People say things like this as if Obama won his second term in a landslide. The popular vote was very very close. How can 51% of americans voting for him indicate support for Obamacare in any way? How many single issue voters are there that were voting for him because of abortion, gay rights or other liberal social hot button topics? To claim that a Democratcic congress (which was kicked out after they passed it) and a Democratic president passed this law so it must be the will of the people is idiotic. The majority of Americans oppose Obamacare. I am sure it because of all the lies evil republicans have fed them though, right? Did you ever think that your Democratic leaders were feeding you their own lies to get you on their side? Of course not becase Democrats are good and pure and Republicans are just pure evil. The only reason anyone would oppose Obamacare is because they want the elderly, children and puppies to die in the gutters so they can increase profits? Get over yourselves. There are serious problems with state run healthcare, and we will see them slowly play out over the next decade. That is why the law was enacted over a timeline, so the harms to the system will be gradual and no one will be able to point and blame it for crashing the system and massively increasing the costs of healthcare and insurance while decreasing the quality provided."
26877712263,"Im a 30 year old male in great health. Never had any problems aside from a few broken bones when I was a child. Two years ago I was paying $80/month for insurance that included a $3000 out of pocket expense. It slowly increased to $90, then to $110, then to $120. A couple days ago I received a letter saying that because of Obamacare, my premium will be going up to $240 per month. How is this suppose to make sense?"
26877712579,"Im not sure I would call with the Supreme Court did upholding Obama care. It should have been voted down and sent back with an opinion, change this wording and admit it is a tax then vote again pass it when everyone understands what it is. "
26877713028,"Never underestimate a disgruntled group of sore losers. Many business owners and corporations who have not been providing any health care to their workers suddenly will have to, and what bugs republicans more than anything? A hit to their donors pocketbook."
26877714077,"hating democrats is enough to claim the will of the people is being disregarded. in reality, the ACA is based on romneycare. obama looked at it and agreed it looks like a good idea. this thing is as bipartisan as anything could ever be. but its the fact that obama likes it is the reason the GOP is now vehemently against it."
26877714934,"Congress has a &lt; 9% approval rating. Id say anything they do now (and then) has been usurped by special interests, most importantly ALEC. Obama wasnt doing it for the people, he was doing it for the corporations. "
26877715529,"Honest Question: I always understood insurance companies served the capacity of reining in medical costs by negotiation with hospitals, is that true? If it is, would it be worth keeping them around? If it isnt, is there some way we can incentive them to do so? "

26877716881,"the main problem is not will of people. if we take will of people, lot of laws would have to be repealed. the problem is, trying to get your preferences putting a gun to the head of budget or debt ceiling. if this works. we dont need no president or congress for that matter. what if democrats block the budget CR when a republican is president saying they wont pass one until they make the minimum wage $15/hr."

26877719212,"I was one of the people who benefited from Obama extending the age someone can be covered under their parents from 25 to 26. Because of that change, I was only without insurance from my birthday in 2010 until January 1st, 2011 (less than a month) and now I have my own insurance. I am still unsure on the matter. My uncle needs good coverage to pay for his cancer treatment, if he were forced to switch to a lesser plan then I would be against it. Also, my Father who is getting up there in age is unhappy because his company has had to drastically downgrade his coverage plan while charging him slightly more money. I know my experience isnt a big enough sample size so thats why I am still torn on this issue. I dont like how its more about what the Dems can do and what the Repubs can stop the Dems from doing, instead of just being about the voice of the people. There may not be 1 plan that fits everyone."

26877720128,"Suggesting that because people voted in favour of Obama (or in general any political candidate under a FPTP voting system) they support *all* of that candidates proposals is silly. The USA, like most first past the post voting countries, is a two party state. This isnt the fault of the American people, its just the nature of the voting system that given enough time two parties will emerge as dominant ([Duvergers Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvergers_law#Duverger.27s_Law.27s_converse)). This means that you likely no longer vote in favour of the candidates you most agree with (perhaps an independent) but have to vote tactically to avoid letting someone you really dont agree with getting power. There is so much more to it than what Ive briefly said but my point is that ultimately you cannot decisively say that the will of the people has or has not been disregarded (based on voting patterns) because the political system itself doesnt accurately represent how people feel. Edit: And I am not making any kind of opinion about Obamacare here - I dont even live in the USA - Im just pointing out that what people want isnt necessarily what they vote for."

26877730954,"The really stupid thing is that a Government shutdown still wont stop ACA from going into effect or being funded. Obamacare is already a *fait accompli*. It is already funded. Shutting down the Government has no effect on it. Its just a childish tantrum from a bunch of entitled babies who just cant handle it that Obama kicked their ass in two elections. The Tea Party is a cancer thats killing the GOP and the GOP rihly deserves it. Theyve pandered to the lowest common denominator so long they are now owned by it.

The billionaires took the time to create the teabaggers so they can hate that dirty black president and do the bidding of the billionaires and somehow a bare minimum health care plan passed so these teabaggers have to stand their ground and make sure that poor people do as they are meant to do, work slave wages, consume, procreate, get sick and DIE! The only people in this country that deserve proper health care are the ones smart enough to be born into a rich family and live lives of luxury their entire life making money off the work of the peons."

26877733093,We had to pass it in order to understand it... how the F does that work?
26877733538,"Im all for debating the benefits of Obamacare, or making some snide remark on the topic attacking either Democrats or Republicans...but am I the only one whos wondering when the entirety of Congress got elected based on Obamacare...or when Obama turned it into the *only* campaign issue he was running on? Obama won because of far more issues, as did other people in Congress now...to assume that it was passed with the will of the people is a little unusual. It was passed by a majority-Democrat Congress, which subsequently lost the House...I could easily say thats the result of Obamacare passing. In short, correlation is not causation, and while I like the idea of healthcare reform (perhaps even Obamacare, I confess Im not well-versed enough in the gigantic impacts it may or may not have to make that call), to say that it was passed with the will of the people is...unusual. I mean, the Supreme Court has judges who were appointed 15-20 years ago, so theres no guarantee they represent the will of *todays* people. Thats not even their purpose; the judicial mandate doesnt state it has to represent the will of the people, and the precedent set since Marshall has been that their biggest job is purely to judge constitutionality of laws. So while you may rightly (or wrongly) agree with Obamacare, that *does not mean it is passed with the will of the people of today*. I mean, lets look at a poll: [This link shows that a plurality of voters think that it shouldnt be repealed, but that doesnt mean they *like it*, which is what is being discussed. Keep in mind this could have been influenced by *how* Republicans are going about trying to defund it, so the poll does have some likely bias.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/09/30/new-poll-only-one-third-of-americans-support-repealing-defunding-or-delaying-obamacare/) Here is likely where Republicans base their arguments against it, regarding it not being what people want: [Basically, a plurality (same as always, not a true majority though) have continually said that they think its a bad idea. However, that isnt to say it really is, or that it should be repealed; just that its not a good idea.](http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/15/20506193-poll-obamacare-remains-highly-unpopular-as-implementation-looms?lite) So yeah, its a lot more complex than Congress passed it, and even though Democrats lost the next election to the House immediately after passing it, Obama won and that was clearly cause of Obamacare! Oh, and judges appointed 10-20 years ago are still up with the times and doing what the people want! Lets not fall into that, and instead decide This is a horrible way of going about it, and people dont want it handled like this, so stop doing it."
26877733583,"In the manner that we all hate what the NSA is doing and they still do it. Just because we get ONE thing that we wanted does not mean that the will of the people is being upheld.

26877733983,"I dont agree with Obamacare and here is why. Starting tomorrow, October 1st, 2013, Obamacare goes into action. Simultaneously, the to pay for this new form of healthcare, the government is cutting other programs. My father is a military veteran who served in the Navy for 22 years, and our healthcare (Tricare Prime) is getting butchered. Not only is our premium and deductible going way up, but if I get sick the closest doctor I can go see is 45 minutes away. Now, a 45 minute drive isnt *that* insane, but as a broke college student, the fact that I cant go to my colleges student health center is friggin ridiculous. "

26877748736,If Republicans are so clairvoyant about the effects of Obamacare what the fuck happened in 2008 when the subprime mortgages crisis collapsed the economy? When countless economists were warning us about this bubble that was about to pop for years prior. 
26877749418,"Furthermore, they dont currently have the votes. Period. They are a minority party with a minority position in government who has been roundly rejected in national elections, and they dont even have the votes to implement their current strategy within our congressional system, and yet are still acting like they are entitled to their entire rejected agenda. They are a fundamentally anti-democratic party. If they are voted in, theyll govern like George W. Bush. If theyre voted out, theyll just try to break the system. Whatever rationale they are using at any given time is just completely made up propaganda for doing the exact same thing, and they will use the exact opposite reasoning when the shoe is on the other foot. If you pay real attention to politics for a year or two, this is indisputable and the GOP is not a democratically acceptable party anymore."

26877750044,"Maybe Im fucking missing the concept here, whats so hated about Obamacare. Let me make sure I grasp it : Every American will be required to have some type of an insurance policy, and insurance policies have new requirements. (I dont fully grasp how someone is required to be covered, but, sure.) So, people who are already covered (paying for it through a benefit offered by your job, say) have essentially no change. People who werent previously covered (work somewhere without benefits/dont work/etc) are now being forced to pay some kind of monthly bill. Note, after some research, Im seeing numbers of $11 a month and $23 a month in a couple of states, and thats for a *family of four*. Obviously its bare bones, but its better than nothing. So who is this group of people incredibly upset? It seems like everyone with a good job and smooth life is already covered and will have no changes. It seems like people who werent covered before are, yes, forced to pay some money a month, but its an amount that Id be shocked to find out they couldnt afford. Please dont lend me your horseshit about $11 a month is tough for some. If its tough for some, Im going to need to see how exactly Obamacare forces you to pay for these things. I imagine homeless people wont be paying for health insurance. http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx After reading that, I dont fully grasp why people dislike it so much. Is it really just because people feel forced to buy something, and feel that is unconstitutional? You pay taxes constantly, thats paying for something you might not want, why isnt that unconstitutional. Jesus."
26877752166,"I honestly just cant wrap my head around why this is such an issue in the US. We had complete universal healthcare as early as the fifties in The Netherlands. Every other rich, developed democracy has it. How is this not common sense? "

26877756187,"Dont assume any of those august bodies represent the will of the people or that selecting Obama over the dreadful McCain/Palin is a ringing endorsement of anything. I oppose it on philosophical grounds (it uses the IRS to essentially operate as indirect knee-breakers for poorly regulated private insurance concerns) and practical ones (single payer would work better) That said the ACA has yet to actually go into effect, it might work out fine or it might prove to implode. We do not know yet."
26877756608,"But recent polls are saying... (blah, blah, blah)"
26877757750,"The fact that the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate under the ACA doesnt mean it was in accord with the will of the people today. It means that it was in accord with the Constitution, which was created in 1787 and last amended in 1992. "

Then the kid who lost and his cousins cut the brake lines on the Cafeteria Delivery Truck and we had to shut down the cafeteria for a week. The other kids beat up on those couple who didnt like the Pizza until they moved back to Alabama."
26877759437,"Working in the restaurant industry, I can tell you this law will hurt the people its supposed to help more then it helps them. In my area most restaurants are dropping people to less than 30 hrs/wk since they cant afford coverage for them. So these people (who make close to minimum wage) now will likely have to get a second job just to pay for healthcare because they cant afford the tax if they dont. I cant imagine those people are very happy about that. "
26877759814,"Its nothing but ranting and raving by poor losers. They ought to look a bit closer at their hero, Ted Cruz, who gets his insurance subsidized by Goldman Sachs, a company that was bailed out by the rest of us. Shocking how little his fans care. "
26877762081,Most polls show that a majority of the people do not want it. That is the manner in which their will is being disregarded. 
26877763750, not everyone voted for Obama and his retarded ideas
26877763744,"Because people dont want it. And by dont want they mean we want it but dont want to pay for it. Generally speaking, of course."
26877765093,"I think youre forgetting the legislative process there which is the most important part. If constituents dont want it then it shouldnt be passed. Being elected President after campaigning for Obamacare shouldnt be seen as a sign the country wants it, just seen as a sign that they think Obama would be a better President than Romney. If people are talking to their representatives and telling them they dont want it and they are passing the bill anyway then that means the will of the people is being disregarded."
26877767139,"As someone strongly against govt healthcare, I would never argue that the peoples will was disregarded. Initially, you could make that argument. Now I just think the population is much stupider than I could have ever imagined. We are definitely getting what we asked for. "
26877770746,"The Republicans know whats going to happen. Old people are going to pay less for healthcare and will realize the Republicans are full of shit. They are willing to shut down government to prevent this from happening. Think about that. They are willing to shut down the government and hurt the country to stop legislation that they say will...hurt the country. If the ACA is so awful, why not let it run for a year, fuck up the country, and then the Republicans can fucking clean up in the midterm elections and repeal it without worrying about a veto? Could it be because they know the opposite will happen?"
26877771418,In our form of government as designed by the founders the peoples will was almost irrelevant in the national government. A republic is designed to ensure that wise men are elected as leaders and they will make decisions as laws based on what they believe is the best corse of action. The republicans were elected by their constituents and are governing or attempting to on the basis of what they believe is right. Simply put the will of the people should have no role in the healthcare decision 
26877771890,"For most people, it will be more expensive than what they already have. I think some of the less educated people think that they are getting free healthcare. Truth is, poor people have always had free healthcare if they were truly poor. Some people didnt buy it because they thought it was too expensive but those same people had smartphone, nice cars, and houses that are too big for a realistic budget. My healthcare premiums are going from $615 to over $1100 per month under Obamacare. This is not Affordable Healthcare. This is a dumb law and if you look, the people who passed the law are exempt from it or are getting subsidies because it is too expensive. (Congress, unions). Its a sham of the first order."

26877773614,How is it that they are attacking Obama on healthcare yet mostly ignore the NSA scandal. I dont think they intend to accomplish anything with this farce. It is just some tactic used to distract people from focusing on other issues. It is a popular topic and so long as America is divided they can keep up the pretense of addressing an important issue. And I mean both sides really dont give a shit theyre both content with the status quo.
26877773908,This justification works for literally anything the government does

26877777615,None of those institutions necessarily pursue the will of the people.
26877777842,"We dont live in a democracy but a constitutional republic, and the will of the people has very little to do with constitutional rights. If Americans understood that, there would be way less problems, since then youd realize you cant just do whatever you want, even if you have the majority behind you, and so unless you pass an amendment that says Congress has the power to fine someone for not doing something that is not against the law, then Obamacare is unconstitutional. The headline sums up how people dont understand the meaning of constitutionality. Just because Congress and the Executive say something does not make it constitutional, notwithstanding a Judiciary opinion from a corrupt body, especially given its 5-4. The Roberts courts opinion re Obamacare is as legitimate as Rehnquists (ugh) 2000 opinion installing Bush Jr. Nay, its not a single opinion but the court itself, what dont you get? "
26877778214,"The people dont get to vote directly (federally) on laws. Theres a reason for this the founders anticipated: mob mentality. If we did, blacks would likely have been slaves and segregated longer or even to this day. Without a representative Republic, the majority could and would take advantage of the minority. Republicans are citing polls that lead the participants into skewed results to say on this one, singular law, that we should have mob rule because, umm, freedom. Ill bet they wouldnt welcome a national vote on raising the capital gains tax rate. "
26877778882,"&gt;So in what manner was the will of the people disregarded? Most dont have a clue how they will be affected, will of the people is pure BS, as that was not the only thing that people used to decide who to vote for. All current national polls shows the majority dont want it. That would mean the only ones listening to their constituents is the Republicans. Congress is exempt. President is exempt. Leading Senate Democrats are talking as we speak, Still nothing about Jobs, Economy, Health Care for All, just more BS about ACA and Gun Grabbing. People actually think these cronies, are on anyones side but themselves and their rich buddies? When it finally fails, maybe we can have universal health care then. Cant believe so many hate the poor. What will ACA do for the Poor? According to Kaiser and HealthCare.gov, if the state doesnt expand Medicaid, they are still screwed."

Itd be cheaper to drop my health care plan and buy my own but I dont have that option."
26877800996,"It wasnt the will of the people who elected these particular Congresspeople. Remember that a lot of these guys got elected by moving farther to the right than the incumbent Republican and vowing to go to Washington and repeal Obamacare, never vote for a tax increase, and basically fight the Satan Obama and all his works. If they dont engage in these histrionics and make a fuss, then in the next primary, there will be someone even farther to the right that they are who will promise to do more. This in itself is an argument against term limits for congress. Imagine what this would be like without Boehner there to try and temper them."
26877809381,"Something so large and critical to the American condition needs to have a multiyear timeline for public discussion thats moderated by our elected officials instead of dictated by our elected officials. What both of political parties are pushing for is rushed and not well thought out. Do you really believe this will be a well implemented program? Do you believe that there is a good alternative proposal? - If they wanted to really do whats best for the people, youd see: ? An honest 10 year timeline for implementation (small pieces at a time starting at year 4-5) ? Quarterly televised national debates by experts in the field (i.e. non politicians) on baseline fundamental components (effectiveness, resources needed, cost per person, fallback plan, and implementation) ? Citizen voting on milestones that set the fundamental components in place piece by piece so to ensure a smooth implementation. ? Postmortem to ensure all components of the program were implemented properly. - What youre getting is political theater thats going to cost a lot, be poorly implemented, and has no real competitor provided by the competing political parties. Our elected officials are lost and were following them deeper into the forest. Good luck......"

26877829597,"1. Healthcare does indeed need some type of reform. When people get sick, or are victims of accidents, there should be nobody that profits as a direct result. 2. ACA is not the best way to go about that reform. 3. Using the threat of a government shutdown as leverage to get what you want is a tactic developed in pre-school, like a temper tantrum, and has no place among grownups. 4. If I had tried something like this to get my way as a child, I would have gotten my ass whooped."
26877830326,"Reddit aside, ACA is actually pretty unpopular because of two things that work very well against it: 1. Nobody knows anything about it 2. except that the GOP links it to socialism; something that, through great effort, has become a bit of a bad word in the US I would like to say that I support the ACA, but I admit that I dont know shit about it. I know you can have insurance on your kids until theyre 26 now, something else about pre-existing conditions, and that my workplace cant subsidize marketplace insurance plans because of an agreement between them and their current provider (which sucks, I was really looking forward to finding a more personalized insurance plan with the help of my employers existing contribution). Those are all really cool things according to a lot of us here on reddit, but this is a HUGE program and im a bit disappointed with Obama &amp; Co. for not making the details more accessible to people who dont feel like staring at a wall of text (myself)."

Why should I be forced to pay for people who cannot, or will even make efforts to try. We have let people think that it is ok for the government to piggy back them and in this effort they support the government. It is akin to a bribe to the people telling them the government cares about them and is doing good thing. The interests of the American Empire are being looked after, not the people.

This is how they get away with this kind of shit. If youre against the practices of a government, dont make it piecemeal. These people will abuse the power we give them, one hundred percent of the time. And worse yet, youre all behind the Democrats as if the Republicans are the only ones raping us!

The Court held that African Americans, whether slave or free, could not be American citizens and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court,and that the federal government had no power to regulate slavery in the federal territories acquired after the creation of the United States. So, we could reinstate slavery and the left should shut up about it because it was the law of the land and the Supreme Court upheld its practice? We should or could reinstate [prohibition].

Rich people who stand to lose money dont give a fuck about the will of the people, the president, congress, or the Supreme Court. They dont give a fuck about Jesus or the Tea Party or Occupy Wall Street. They dont give a fuck about Jon Stewart, Rush Limbaugh, Msnbc, Or Fox News. They give a fuck about their bank account. Take away their ability to control anything with their bank account. The rest means literally nothing."

26877877635,"Like water, seeking the easiest path downhill, some of the effects of the ACA will be felt indirectly. - I am hearing of frantic efforts by corporations to offshore jobs (heck, we all are), downsize employee populations, and remove the words full time from all job descriptions. Couple that with the individual mandate to provide insurance. - There are stories of doctors throwing in the towel - apparently, with Medicare-level reimbursements, the overhead associated with larger practices amounts to a negative cash flow. The NP role (and less-trained nurses too) may be the one offering the bulk of care in the future. - While the initial prices I am seeing for the marketplace look to be pretty affordable, I wonder what happens when those who formerly did not have insurance enroll. For an insured group to be successful they have to be healthy, or at least half-way healthy. If you have a uniformly unhealthy population the rates collected do not cover the costs, forcing the rates to increase to cover the costs. I think those rates as initially published will be changing, and I would bet even money that they wont all decrease in price."

If the people who elected the current Congress disapprove of the way they are handling this situation, theyll have the opportunity to elect someone else in the next election. Perhaps the law should be changed so such delay would not be permitted? However I feel both Dems and Repubs use any advantages available to them for political posturing.

26878011856,The problem with posting this on Reddit is that I doubt there are more than 2 redditors in the world who would admit being tea party republicans 
26878014062,"Congress passed Obamacare: Because we all know that Congress acts in the peoples interest 100% of the time, thats why it has such an astronomical approval rating. The President signed it: The American people elected the President on the promise of Health care reform, making healthcare cheaper and more accessible. Once the President is elected, its not like we have a say in the legislation he drafts, he does what he wants and congress votes on it. The Supreme Court upheld it: The Supreme Court also does not always act in the interest of the American people. Seperate but equal ring a bell? Just because the Supreme Court upheld it, it does not mean the will of the people was taken into consideration. Obama re-election: Slim margin of victory when all things were considered. Near 50/50 split. Plus, there is such a thing as a tyranny of the majority. Also, I think the massive protests of this healthcare law, as well as plenty of people taking to social media is indicative that the people are clearly upset by this law."
26878015588,"Im going to be honest. I dont even know what Obamacare is. It has been a buzz word. Ive heard it is universal healthcare or something to that effect, but I have absolutely no idea how to get it, sign up for it, buy it, or whatever is were supposed to do with it. As far as the talk about cutting food stamps. I know that a lot of people need them. I also know that a lot of people use them as a crutch and that when faced with going hungry or finding a meal, they will figure out a way to eat. Crisis leads to ingenuity. We are never more creative than when faced with adversity. It is going to suck, but in the long run, it may be a good thing."
26878025039,Obamacare was passed without 1 republican vote! Who the fuck didnt see this coming? This is what happens when one side is completely left out.

26878031497,"Playing devils advocate here: If you are a representative from TN or SC, it is very likely that the people you represent WERE disregarded. A representative is not meant to think **for** their district or state but rather to voice the will of their state. If you are from a place like the former confederacy, where you might see your state as sovereign, you might feel that your will has been disregarded.

Now they simply want to delay ObamaCare for one year for further studies.

Why arent the Democrats willing to further delay implementation for another year to analyze this giant 10,000+ page bundle of regulations?"

They have found some technicalities that they can abuse to magnify their influence. The whole thing is fairly tragic. I dont imagine this will become less common. More political minorities will start using these tactics to hold bills up and force new negotiations on settled issues again and again. Welcome to a new level of dysfunctional governance. "
26878043390,"Republicans really need to defend themselves here. It seems plausible that Republicans are willing to ruin this entire country at this very moment because they dont like Obamacare. Im in my late twenties and what Im saying is that they (may be) willing to basically ruin (at least) the next 5 years if not more of MY life because they dont like Obamacare. You dont like Obamacare? Win the next election. Win the next presidency. Get all three chambers like you had with Bush. But until then, your job is to govern. What that means is that your job is to get stuff done for the American people. Its not perfect and for the next year it may be a bit distasteful, but youre job is to serve your constituents the BEST you can to get stuff done and to keep our way of life, both in terms of physical safety or economic safety, intact. The only thing that Republicans have nowadays is rhetoric. They have no substance. Its all principle this, principle that. Life is much messier than that. This is what happens when you elect people who arent in tune with the real world. Other countries get along. Look at Germany or the Northern European countries."

Boehner on the other hand is still concerned about his job rather than the party as a whole. He will be royally screwed if he cant muster up the votes to pass his Plan C, he will then have to need Democratic support to get anything done. Then he will lose his job, the question is what is more important to him. His job or his party.

You can keep your doctor, keep your health care plan, your premiums will go down $2,700 per family. None of that was true, and because people voted on false information their votes were stolen and democracy denied. In my opinion, no matter how many good things may lie within it, the ACA does not have legitimacy. Its no wonder to me at all that people feel it is legitimate to use any tactic whatsoever to repeal, delay or subvert it any way they can."
26878075107,"Yeah, a law gets passed that republicans dont like so they quit doing their jobs and put the country at risk? WTF? Fire em all."
26878082658,"Since they didnt bother to get any Republican support for ACA. If the argument trying to be made is that the Democrats followed the letter of the law in passing ACA, then the same exact argument applies to what the Republicans are trying to do now.

26878093895,the SCOTUS has only ruled on one challenge to the law so far. They havent even taken up the numerous other challenges on other grounds. Just because they found one provision to be constitutional does not mean they wont find others to be unconstitutional. Just sayin.

Remember You have to pass it before you will find out whats in it? Remember the backroom deals made to Blue Dog Democrats? Offering their states money, exemptions anything to get their vote? &gt; The Supreme Court upheld it The Supreme Court only upheld it when considered a tax. This would mean that Obamacare is one of the largest tax increases on the middle class in the nations history. Remember Obama claimed that it wasnt a tax?

I live in a crazy conservative state, so I dont know if this is a lie of not. That being said, assuming it is true, what about those people who already *cant* afford insurance? If theyre forced to buy insurance, but cannot due so because of their current incomes, will the just be penalized more for being poor? Thanks to anyone who answers."

Now, its on the table, its relevant, so its whats best. But are there not so many more ways to deal with a crisis than something that is so controversial. I suppose anything will be. But its basic finance. If you dont have any money and youre in debt, dont keep borrowing more and keep putting yourself further in the hole."

Should the Affordable Care Act be repealed, this legislation would prevent all members of Congress from receiving taxpayer funded health care benefits when they retire from Congress. &gt;For decades, Americans have given Congress consistently failing grades while Congress has been playing by its own rules. Congress needs to stop giving themselves perks and sweetheart benefits that are not available to American citizens and play by the same rules that hardworking American families do.

26878208830,"I work for a Tea Party Congressman and at the risk of being thrown in the lake of fire/angry-internet-comments, Id just like to present the point of view that I spew each day at the office to angry democratic citizens. So, to give the fox news explanation of things, not a single Republican Congressman voted for this bill. While that may not seem significant to some, it is significant given the back ground of the constitution as a document inspired by Madisons Virginia plan. The Congress was designed by Madison to be hopelessly inefficient. Why? In case (for example) a majority of crazy-right-wing-conservatives were somehow voted in with the mind set that they would remove all taxes and all welfare programs in one fell swoop of legislation, despite how loudly the left clamored for their blood over these changes, these changes would be hindered by discussion, compromise and the effort it takes to get anything done in Congress. Madison wanted to prevent the majority faction from overwhelming the concerns of the minority in the blind quest of a single goal. What happened with the ACA was, to many in the Republican party, an example of this. If I remember correctly, Nancy Pelosi did not allow debate on the house floor, and then called for a vote without any significant compromise. The Republicans felt as if their concerns have not been heard in this matter. Next, you must understand that while Obama was elected in a nation-wide election, the House and the Senate have a more narrow constituency. My Congressman ran on the promise that he would repeal Obama Care shortly after the law was passed when the minority Republicans were feeling particularly insignificant. The people in our district expect our elected official to act this way, if he didnt hed probably be voted out because he would, in the truest sense, be ignoring the peoples will. That being said... This fight is entirely symbolic. We know it, the Republicans know it. The only ones who dont know are the people who are voting for the tea party. Ive found this a little disingenuous on the part of the Republican party. Many of the people who call in support of Obama Care to be de-funded seem to think this is an actual possibility. Its not, but Fox News says it is and so they think it is. Its kind of sad to listen to sometimes... "
26878216346,"Obama Care I just heard the most interesting idea. The House needs to pass a bill that negates all exclusions, changes, revisions, whatever else has been changed. Congress and big business and the unions have to abide by the law as it was written, passed and signed. Then a sundown clause has to be added. Meaning if this thing is as bad as most Americans think or if its as good as the Democrats believe it will have to be voted on again in 2 years. The Senate will have to vote on this law. Lets see their true colors."
26878222529,Cant see why people think this a controversial issue. The law says that instead of say Fuck these people. Screw it lets see what happens. you are saying to them Now you dont have a choice on whether or not to get fuck in the ass by a corporation.

26878225620,"Ya know, back in the 1990s I was appalled when the GOP prosecuted the President over The (cum)Shot Heard Round The World. I really thought they couldnt go any lower than that. Then came the 00s. GOP lies got us into a war that caused the deaths of over a million people (Iraq) and the displacement of God knows how many more. They used the excuse of protecting us from terrorism to drive home the security state that they worked hard to establish through the War on Drugs in the 1980s. Basically they eviscerated the Bill of Rights, and when liberals like myself complained we were called un-American. Just like in the 80s we were disparaged for defending what we held the Constitution to be, all because of their stupidity, or maybe because of their unwillingness to really examine their beliefs and what path those beliefs lead us to. Now we have this. In order to further an ideology, a political agenda, these cocksuckers are more than happy to destroy the economy of the US. They complain about welfare and strip SNAP out of the Farm bill, all while increasing the amount of money that bill puts out to multi-billion dollar industrial agriculture. All in all, I have to say, the GOP is truly a home for disgusting human beings. Its a damned shame they have any say at all in the affairs of our nation. May they rot in a hell that I dont believe in, but that they seem to believe in whole-heartedly. What pigs."
26878226716,"I just read an article that was discussing what would happen if a person doesnt pay the penalty for not having insurance. According to the article, there are clauses in the ACA that say basically the IRS will have no real power for collecting the penalty. Now, if you had a refund due, they would subtract the difference of the penalty you owe from your refund, but the IRS will not be allowed to garnish wages, seize property and even pursue any sort of criminal action against you if you dont pay the penalty. article --&gt; http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/13/readers-ask-we-answer-what-happens-if-you-dont-pay-obamacares-tax-penalty/"
26878227851,"most people i know dont know enough about obamacare to care one way or the other. we just dont like him. and so if he is for it, were against it. "
26878231635,"What really nips at my nipples is hearing Republicans say that Obamacare is not working, its time to reverse it while the law is not even active yet. Fundamentally, opponents of the ACA are afraid that it will not only work but that this law will go down in history as a major step forward in the history of the US. Cant wait to watch the back pedaling and flip flopping well be seeing then. And when this starts happening, a lot of the opponents will see their political careers and presidential aspirations vanish in a puff of smoke. By 2015, anyone whos still opposing the Affordable Care Act will have no future on the US political scene. "
26878231877,How is mandating that you maintain health insurance a good thing? All it is doing is guaranteeing that health insurance companies are going to make more money and screw more people over. Good going and NOT the will of all the people.
26878234696,Were saying the same things over again- Flobots
26878237505,They have found a new way to enforce cuts in the social programs they hate so much. Even tepid reforms such as Obamacare.
26878239177,There are people who seriously need elements of this such as the pre-existing conditions clause and the no-lifetime limits. The republicans are fucking with people.
26878240012,"I was all for it, but the details of the law are just wrong. I got my letter from the insurance company today, I was paying $75 a month for basic health coverage before, and now I will be paying $280 a month. Apparently Im not allowed to benefit from being a healthy young person anymore, and must pay the same as the elderly fat smokers. All I need is basic catastrophe prevention coverage, I take no medicine, have no conditions, and just need something that kicks in if I end up in an ambulance, it is ridiculous that my monthly bill will increase by a factor of 4. I am considering going without insurance and eating the penalty, the affordable health care act has done the exact opposite for me and made it unaffordable. I knew wed all have to do our part and pay a little more for coverage, but I was expecting something like $125 a month instead of 75, not friggin $280 a month. I appreciate that healthcare laws need to change, but this is the wrong change and if Im forced to pay it, Im gonna change my votes over to the red team."
26878242393,"The same way any unpopular law is the result of the will of the People having been disregarded: The congress elected in 2008 ran, at best, on a platform of health care reform, not the actual Affordable Care Act (a.k.a., Obamacare) itself; the President is not elected by the People directly but by Electors (note: I think this is a good thing but thats a different discussion); the Supreme Court has no role in determining what is the will of the People and only determined the Individual mandate could be interpreted as a use of the taxing power but not a use of the interstate commerce regulation power; Obama campaigned not solely on health reform but also on other issue positions as well the alleged inability of Mitt Romney to govern *as well* as Obama; and, again, the President is not elected by the People directly but by Electors (note: I **still** think this is a good thing but thats a different discussion). With all of these indirections and conditionals applying to any bill which becomes law, scarcely **any** legislation which makes it onto the books could truly be considered as reflecting the will of the People. Whether this result is a good thing or not is a matter of interpretation."
26878245120,The people werent given a chance comprehend what was in it before it was passed; see Pelosi saying we had to pass it to find out what was in it. The Supreme Courts upheld the individual mandate as a tax after the people were told repeatedly that the bill had nothing to do with taxes. Obama predominantly ran for reelection on convincing people that Romney was cheating the public by only paying several million dollars per year in taxes.
26878248340,What a silly question. This fundamentally flawed legislation was forced through by a fiercely partisan Democrat congress without a single Republican vote. The Supreme court reconstructed the law and declared a fee a tax and my insurance is going up by over 60% for my family. Once you understand that the will of the people and this government charade are two entirely different things you will be one step closer to being an adult.
26878249650,Its times like these where I swear were living in some postmodern novel or some shit... Holding our government hostage for their own partisan squabbling. Shits gotten insane yall
26878250330,Because its all rigged. Thats meant as both serious and sarcastic. 
26878256065,Can someone explain to me what is going on about the government shutting down? I need some1 to dumb it down. I think its about congress not being able to make a bill to satisfy one another and they are running out of time for the deadline?
26878259887,"...right, its good for all us little folk, but not good for the big guys and gals on capitol hill. Enjoy, serfs! "
26878263031,"You misunderstood what the GOP means by Will of the people. Dont feel bad it is easy to do. My father is a rabid, raving republican. I am mildly fluent in batshit crazy. Allow me to help. When a republican says Will of the people what they really mean is The desires of the corporations that own me."
26878279200,"The people elected a house of representatives. Do you have a problem with representative democracy? The house has followed the rules and expressed its will, passed a CR. This is the process. The representatives are within their rights representing the will of those who put them in office. Those of you who demand that they not represent their constituents but do as you would prefer them to do reveal yourselves as enemies of the democratic process. "
26878279512,"Look personally I hate Obamacare, I think its an awful idea but it passed through our screwed up government that gets nothing done. D.C. actually got something done may as well try it out for a decade or so hell maybe ill end up liking it idk but i do know i will hate it when my father doesnt get his social security check and he has no way to live. 90% of the time im a diehard conservative but sometimes you just have to be human Really this is our leadership id rather have Obama be president for 8 more years instead of having the republicans throwing a fit everytime they dont get their way. Youre making me look bad!"
26878284878,"It was not. The extreme right does not care about the peoples will, or democracy. They only care about the power they lost. When the old whites that comprise their party die, the country will be much better off (said as an old person!)"
26878285207,See PATRIOT Act.
26878286523,"This really has nothing to do with Obamacare. Tea Party candidates ran on the promise that they would shut down the government, and theyre making good on that promise. Any excuse will do."
26878338687,"From an outsiders perspective, the biggest danger to America seems to be its information bubbles. Basically you have self contained sources of information that peddle a very specific message to a very specific group of people. Right now you have people who live in two different worlds, they only hear what specific groups want them to so they cant even look at this one issue because it isnt the same issue at all to them. If you want to fix your country you need to take care of this. When they came out last week and said there was a major victory for the Republicans they were only speaking to their own people - everyone else was thinking WTF?"
26878368889,I dont even support Obama. But this fact made me angry. How the hell are House republicans saying the will of the American people to get rid of ObamaCare when the damn man won reelection. It wasnt even close. 
26878383596,My toothache is keeping me up because of the pulsing pain running up the side of my head. I really hope this shit passes

26878444206,"Thomas Frank wrote a book about this in 2008. Its called *The Wrecking Crew* and it really lays out how the Grand Old Party rigs government to not work so they can bring in private contractors at twice the price, and other BS. "
26878449144,"Let¡¯s stop making excuses for the GOP. The GOP is actively engaged in a criminal conspiracy to subvert American democracy, through the use of gerrymandering voter suppression and misinformation this is against both the spirit and the letter of the law. I want the GOP to be ousted for the extremist nut jobs that they are. At this point the GOP just seems like a spiteful child throwing a temper tantrum because they did not get there way. The GOP is a cancer on American democracy and must be stamped out."
26878473550,"If fucking con filth morons hate America so much, why do they stay? How would they feel if a Dem congress shut down the government, refused to raise the debt limit unless abortion on demand, paid for by taxpayers became law? Or if they defunded the Iraq war? Or raised the minimum wage? God damn Republicans... rot in hell."
26878475742,"My buddy with a bad back is finally going to be able to do something about it. I couldnt be happier for him, and Im very thankful for Obamacare. "
26878480953,"Maybe if the congress had the chance to actually read the bill before they voted on it, and maybe make the full text of the bill available to the public for a reasonable amount of time to review, like Obama promised to do before signing any legislation back during his first presidential campaign?"
26878484069,I have read the whole ACA in full. I am for it. People should not have to worry about paying ridiculous hospital fees or surcharges on medications. I think this is a good thing.

26878751275,It is a mistake to assume that the Presidents reelection indicates that a majority of the people support the most controversial provisions of the ACA. Health care was only one of many issues voters had to consider in the last election. There are plenty of ways to evaluate public support for the law without resorting to intellectual dishonesty. This sort of rhetoric from politicians undermines public trust.
26879115584,"The PATRIOT Act only passed due to the mass hysteria after 9/11. If this same legislation had been introduced shortly before 9/11, it would have been shot down quicky."

Now on the other hand we did vote him in office, AGAIN, what did we expect? That the Affordable Healthcare Act was magically going to disappear?? I say let the miss-informed America have it on a Government issued gold plate funded by our fake money. "
27065808512,"Congress passed immigration law. The president signed it, the courts have upheld it, the people who passed it were reelected. So why is the president illegally refusing to enforce it?

27017294487,What is a jobs bill supposed to mean anyway?
27016509762,Who knew? National economic sabotage/obstruction and anti-abortion legislation is a job creation effort. Republican legislators must be referring to their gerrymandered jobs alone.
27016434180,"This website is dog shit. They consistently put click bait, such as this article, to generate ad revenue. They link to Boehners speaker.gov page and say here are some of the things Republicans call job bills. Politicususa doesnt say why they arent jobs, it just states as fact that they are not. Top notch journalism! One of the bills was for the pipeline Republicans have been trying to pass for a while. Like the pipeline or not, but its hard to argue that building a HUGE pipeline into the US would not create jobs. "

Does anyone honestly trust ANYONE in the House on either side? It amazes me how people run these articles up the flagpole and everyone jumps in bashing one side or the other. Heres a news flash... Theyre all lying asshats. Think for yourselves people. Dont let some blog masquerading as a news site feed you your facts. "
27016291563,Thank god credible media outlets like politicususa are spreading the truth in a sea of lies. It is ridiculous how the mainstream media lets the Republicanists get away with these lies.

27016547105,"Another democrat myth busted that republicans are the bill blockers.

27016543968,Not sure about dozens but they have sent several jobs bills to Dirty Harry. He then squashed them all without allowing votes. Reid is the biggest obstructionist in recent American history.
27016812159,"Unfortunately, most of their jobs bills were geared to cut public employee jobs."
27016534053,I hard a hard time believing that the House passed jobs bills simply because I cant recall our government simply passing ANY bills at all
27016702392,"There are other ways of creating jobs than jacking up spending so the government can hire people or give more unearned benefits. For instance, anytime you reduce the tax burden on Americans, or reduce regulatory compliance costs for businesses, you are helping to create jobs. Lowering taxes gives people more disposable income, and lower regulatory compliance costs allow businesses to reinvest more of their profits and grow faster. More small businesses could become medium-sized businesses if they had lower compliance costs. So considering a lot of Republican bills do this, it is just as much of a lie to say that Republicans do nothing to create jobs. It is dangerous to think that the Democrats have a monopoly on job creation."

By removing duplicative requirements, the bill would reduce overlapping and unnecessary regulation on pesticides that are already regulated, thereby reducing costs to both farmers and small business owners. 2) H.R. 910Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011: H.R. 910 would prohibit the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases to address climate change under the Clean Air Act. More specifically, the bill would prohibit the EPA from regulating: water vapor; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; and any other substance subject to regulation, action or consideration under the Clean Air Act to address climate change. The bill would prevent a needless increase in energy prices for American households and businesses. 3) H.J.Res. 37Disapproving the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission with respect to regulating the Internet and broadband industry practices: The bill would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from implementing a net-neutrality rule which would prohibit Internet providers from slowing or blocking legal websites or Internet services because of concerns over bandwidth. In May 2010, seventy-four House Democrats sent a letter to FCC Chairman Genachowski making the case that net-neutrality rules will jeopardize jobs and should not be done without additional direction from Congress. 4) H.R. 1230Restarting American Offshore Leasing Now Act: H.R. 1230 would require the Department of the Interior (DOI) to auction offshore oil and gas leases in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico, as well as in an area off the coast of Virginia. The bill would help to reduce energy prices and promote job creation by expediting offshore oil and natural gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and the Virginia coast. 5) H.R. 1229Putting the Gulf of Mexico Back to Work Act: H.R. 1229 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to require that any lessee operating under an approved exploration plan obtain a permit before drilling any well, and obtain a new permit before drilling any well of a design that is significantly different than the design for which an existing permit was issued. The bill would prohibit the Secretary from issuing a permit without ensuring that the proposed drilling operations meet all critical safety system requirements (including blowout prevention), and oil spill response and containment requirements. 6) H.R. 1231Reversing President Obamas Offshore Moratorium Act: H.R. 1231 would require that each five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program offer leasing in the areas with the most prospective oil and gas resources, and would establish a domestic oil and natural gas production goal. The bill would essentially lift the Presidents ban on new offshore drilling by requiring the Administration to move forward on American energy production in areas estimated to contain the most oil and natural gas resources. 7) H.R. 2021¡ªThe Jobs and Energy Permitting Act of 2011: H.R. 2021 would eliminate needless permitting delays that have stalled important energy production opportunities off the coast of Alaska. The bill would also eliminate the permitting back-and-forth that occurs between the EPA and its Environmental Appeals Board. Rather than having exploration air permits repeatedly approved and rescinded by the agency and its review board, the EPA will be required to take final action ¨C granting or denying a permit¡ªwithin six months. 8) H.R. 2018¡ªClean Water Cooperative Federalism Act of 2011: H.R. 2018 would a restrict the EPA ability to issue a revised or new water quality standard for a pollutant whenever a state has adopted and EPA already has approved a water quality standard for that pollutant, unless the state concurs with the EPA Administrato"

27114354243,"[The number of people receiving food stamps continues at near-record levels.] (http://www.factcheck.org/2013/10/obamas-numbers-october-update/) However, we shouldnt be surprised at such increases. Ever since the collapse of the finance sector during the Bush presidency and the resulting Great Recession, more people have been forced into poverty. There are more long-term unemployed than weve seen since the Great Depression of the late 1920s and 1930s. Furthermore, the tidal wave of money moving from the poor and middle classes to those who already are (by comparison) fabulously wealthy continues. As more and more people are forced into poverty, they require more and more public assistance."
27114276647,Ha. Funny. Read the post and read the comments. Im far from being part of the tea party.
27114217120,"I believe it has, but thats because of a little thing called **THE F*CKING RECESSION**, which, ya know, left people needing help."
27114249314,"&gt;people consider Obamacare welfare How could anyone possibly consider that welfare? People are not being *given* insurance; theyre *buying* insurance. Yes, some people receive subsidies, but that was funded by tax increases. Obamacare is revenue neutral and actually contributes to lowering the deficit."
27114333869,Im having trouble finding sources but have heard talk that some states have changed the signup process for federal benefits. Basically if you qualify for one program you are automatically enrolled in any other program that you qualify for. While this doesnt change the population of people who deserve benefits it could be changing the number of people and the amount of benefits going out. Obviously the recession has something to do with it but something like this would explain why the total isnt shrinking the farther we get from the recession. Is this simply not true? Does anyone have any information on this?
27114274551,"I hope its revenue neutral. Its kind of hard to tell as of right now since its in such early stages. I dont consider it welfare at all but Obama did help higher the poverty line for qualifying who can get more subsidies or just getting Medicaid. I dont know if increasing taxes can offset such costs just yet. Regardless, health care is one of the tricky subjects where peoples well-being is more important than money in the end."
27114295606," The characterization of what is welfare should be fleshed out...Lets say that I received Social Security since President Obama was elected, am I part of that welfare class. Amazing that someone would be quite incapable of using a search engine to discern for themselves....then they would actually learn something.....as my mom always told me - the dictionary is paid for!"
27114391188,Republican Administration (Bush) Destroys Economy right before leaving office = more people unemployed = more people on welfare during Obamas Presidency. It has gotten better recently though. http://i.imgur.com/c5sxZhK.png
27114267132,"This was a very good example thanks. It does look like, from that one program that welfare has gone up. It only represents SNAP but people who get SNAP usually get other from of assistance as well. And I dont really want to create my own definition of welfare. I need some kind of standard with which to go with so I understand how and why things are. There doesnt seem to be such a simple definition though."
27114312285,"Thats kind of what Im wondering myself. The dictionary will give you a definition for welfare but when you look up statistics on welfare spending, there will be several charts from different groups on the same subject with different projections. And to answer your question, I did find a chart (forgot where) that grouped social security in as welfare spending. "

27114229023,"As you pointed out, it depends on what you consider welfare. Heres the governments SNAP (food stamp) [budget summary](http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/snapsummary.htm) for every year since it started. Number of participants and benefits/recipient have both gone up significantly from Bushs last year to 2013. Total spending of the program has more than doubled over that time. If you want a straight answer youll need to determine which of the programs you consider to be welfare then go to all the other government budget summary pages for those programs and look for yourself. "
27114573821,"The way welfare spending usually works is, if a person applies for assistance and they meet the qualifications specified in law, they get it. More people are poor enough to qualify and need it since the recession, which started before Obama took office. Im not aware of any changes to the law or policy making it easier to qualify, only recent cuts to SNAP. Theyre just blaming him on a correlation and ignoring causation, because it doesnt fit their narrative."
27114333721,"There is no welfare. Everything we get in this country is owed to us from years of sales taxes and payroll taxes. Years of SS and medicare coming out of our pay. We pay into everything and deserve anything we get from the government. Claim your right to the benefits we have at our disposal as Americans. Its your right and you paid for it. Im tired of the demonization of the great society we have built. I say take it a step further: Medicare-for-all, living wage! Public pension to supplement SS. "
27114268761,"Thanks, this was very helpful, but I dont know what is considered welfare as it pertains to this charts. It seems to be all relative to who your asking. "
123773406,"http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/21ow66/can_someone_explain_to_me_whether_or_not_welfare/ Can someone explain to me whether or not welfare spending has really gone up under Obama presidency? Im not sure who or what to believe because I cant really get a straight answer.When I did a little digging, people consider Obamacare welfare (which I dont agree with) which explains why people are saying welfare spending has increased. So aside from Obamacare, has welfare increased under Obamas presidency as dramatically as is claimed?"
27114276219,Yes it has. Both personal and corporate. What hasnt gone up are the wages of the poor &amp; middle class.
27114270235,"Yeah, I know the recession hit hard and people will obviously need help. I dont have anything to say about that. Im just trying to verify the claims that I hear in the paper, from friends/family and TV."

27118053901,A) The GOP will continue to pound this issue because thus far it is being predicted as a GOP Senate takeover as long as the current trajectory (bashing Obamacare) continues. B) I wouldnt go so far as to say that it has been a huge success either. Only 1/3 of current enrollees didnt have health insurance prior to Obamacare. It kinda fails at its purpose then...
27118199860,"I now have health insurance, and can visit my doctor for $25. My monthly premium is going to be about $27, down from $180--what I was quoted last time I checked. I have not been to the doctor in 11 years. I am ecstatic to have a health care option and cannot wait to schedule a check up with my new doctor that the plan even helped me choose. To those people that can now visit the doctor, its a big deal."
27118186806,"&gt; Only 1/3 of current enrollees didnt have health insurance prior to Obamacare. It kinda fails at its purpose then... 1. Obamacare has insured 9.5 million Americans who previously did not have insurance. You call that failure, I call that helping 9.5 million Americans. And without impacting the deficit, which has been dropping consistently since Obama took office. 2. Obamacare wouldve insured a hell of a lot more people before republicans gutted the shit out of it. Fact is, this is not Obamacare, this is watered-down Romneycare. But its better than nothing, and you cant blame Obama for Boehners choices. 3. Additionally, Republican Governors are refusing to take federal medicaid money, because then theyd have to pass it on to the icky poor people in their state. Thereby further watering-down Obamacare and hurting the people in their states. All Democrats have to do is convey these truths to the public, rather than sticking to Republican talking points, and theyd be able to make some headway popularity-wise."

If my job results in $150,000 in profit for the company and they only pay me $40,000 well thats no different than a serf giving 2/3 of their crops to the Lord who thinks he is doing him a favor letting him work his land just like companies think they are doing us a favor by giving us a job.

If your goal is a major paradigm shift in the political landscape, then yes, your vote doesnt make much direct difference. However, voting can make more granular differences - see Elizabeth May in Saanich-Gulf Islands (first elected Green Party Member in Canadian parliament). It can introduce different voices into the political charade. There are smaller, less important policies, laws, and issues that are definitely effected by even a small number of votes -- and to forfeit your obligation to take part in the democratic process, as futile as it might seem when looking at the bigger picture, is just irresponsible. I cant say for certain what will or wont happen if you and I vote. However, I can GUARANTEE you that nothing happens when we all sit on our ass and cite the ineffectiveness of voting as a culprit of democratic corruption.

They put a hairy idiot on the TV and pressed him on his ideas. Ideas that are sound and justified and that are upheld by the masses. While reinforcing that Russell is correct Paxman legitimises the issues but equally shows that change is futile, irresponsible and not sustainable. The media will never interview a person and broadcast a sound reasoning for any political debate. In the UK we have Question Time. A show that on the face of it looks like were having an open political debate; however, the people on the panel do nothing but squabble. They frequently say things have to change, to loud applause but there are no answers or alternatives on the show. This creates the image that makes the audience think. Hell yes, something is going to be done, the media are our voice! But really its a massive circle jerk.

26906438773,And Republicans rush to defend these job creators as people who somehow deserve unlimited untaxed income
26906440851,"This makes the US look like one big slave plantation with the few occupying the ruling class and the many working having what they produce taken from them by the political/economic system. Wait. If it looks like it is a slave plantation is it. Economic fascism is the collusion of corporations, wealthy individuals, and special interest groups with politicians to rig the economy in their own favor at the expense of everyone else. Why do you think people make big political contributions? Out of the generosity of their own hearts? I think not. They do it so politicians will pass laws that favor them. But the economic advantage they are granted by these laws put everyone else at a disadvantage. It is like one football team having 11 players and the other having 5. Which one always wins? Of course the gullible public falls for the line that these laws are there to protect the public. Protect and serve; bullshit. I know the public is gullible because they cant even figure out that this is not freedom, so they blame the free market. Clue boys; free market economies produce a normal bell curve distribution of wealth with few in poverty, and are not rigged by governments; they are controlled by competition. All the robber barons of the 19th century became so because of laws that protected them and gave them advantage. It is the same today with banks, Wall Street, drug companies, and numerous other segments of the economy scamming the rest of us with their government granted privileged positions. In the whole history of the world there have been very few private organizations that gained a monopoly position by competing, and these only did so because they delivered good products at low prices. When the government steps in, you get poor products at high prices. Wake up. If you want to eliminate this skewed distribution of wealth, demand that government remove itself from the economy except to punish fraud, theft, and collusion to rig markets. Demand freedom. Otherwise you will have slavery, and the big slave plantation on which you now live will only make your life worse, and deservedly so if you are foolish enough to clamor for more government control."

26906441546,Not all wealthy people are bad. Stop being a dick because youre poorer. 
26906444971,"I literally had an argument with my roommates trying to explain to them how the wealth disparity in America is terrible and that a lot of people dont even get a living wage while people like Donald Trump have billions and only help people with it for tax and PR purposes. Their response? The poor people didnt try hard enough, and they dont deserve to earn a living wage for working 40 hours a week. One of them kept trying to convince me that if anyone tries hard enough, they could even play professional basketball. I mean, really? I couldnt shake them from this idea that people shouldnt make a living wage if they didnt get an education or dont try hard enough. I tried to explain different circumstances that would lead to someone not being able to pursue an education. (or a sports dream, which can be shattered with a broken bone) They countered with an argument that 40 hours isnt even half of the time they are awake in a week. Then stuff about their economics classes explaining to them that if the minimum wage was increased and everyone was employed, our entire economy would collapse. Obviously there always needs to be a small pool of unemployment for hiring reasons, but come on. Anyone have any idea what I could say to them that might change their minds?"
26906446960,"So, instead of the story being about what Russell Brand said, the story is that Russell Brand said something. Fantastic. "
26906447087,"I dont see the problem? Most of them have worked hard and reaped the rewards from the free market. Good for them. I really hate the whole rich people are cunts attitude this place has.

26906448730,"Youll always be able to say, *X* Americans have the same amount of wealth as the *Y* million poorest Americans. Its just a matter of math. "

26906453092,kill them :) 
26906454090,My issue with him is his idea of redistribution of wealth. No free society can take forcefully take money from another and give to another based on the idea that they make to much. Everything else I totally agree with him on.

26906459967,The article itself is poorly written and the message is terrible too. Complains but doesnt vote to help change the status quo and pines for a revolution in which he surely would not be on the side of the poor.

26906459983,"The interview is from the BBC, so dont say things like Like Im going to trust voiceofrussia!, it was posted from around 4 different UK sources yesterday. Thats fine if you dont trust the original sources, lets just not try make this an Russia vs the world thing."
26906460348,is it just me or the reporter is kinda laughing at him because what he says doesnt make sense
26906462071,Voiceofrussia.com Now do the same for russia
26906462731,"Is there any publicly available data to substantiate this claim that 300=85,000,000, or put differently that 300 Americans are as wealthy as close to 25% of total US population? If there is, Russell is right. "
26906463397,I surprised to see the rise of Communism in the US in the past few years. 
26906467141,And them being rich made you poor how? If your of the type sitting around waiting for the Government to Tax the working class more to give it to the none working class you deserve what you have and in actuality you are stealing the money that could increase the amount the truly needy could be receiving. Living off the tax payers generation after generation is not a safety net its a hammock!!

26906470039,Brand underestimates the general apathy of the people.
26906472329,"Heres my take... I dont mind our government catering to corporations. That is, if it is done wisely....and its not being done that way. For instance, they claim that we need to cater to corporations because they create jobs. And when people have jobs, they have money. And when they have money, they can spend it. Which necessitates more jobs and stimulates the economy. However, they currently give breaks to large corporations and those additional dollars go directly into their pockets. So why dont they make these big breaks available to large corporations IN EXCHANGE for the effect they are desiring? Instead of assuming that giving them loads of tax breaks will make them create jobs....how about we give them tax breaks FOR CREATING JOBS? If your median employee makes 10% of your CEOs salary...tax break. If you provide healthcare and PTO to your employees...tax break. If you have a net increase of jobs...tax break. etc. Instead of just handing them money and saying Now you go do some good in the community with this money, why dont we just say Do some good in the community, and youll get a tax break."

26906480803,TIL Russel Brands economic and historical opinion is important. /r/politics circlejerk is going hard today.
26906481383,"Is this a bad thing? I could see if this was income - but weve discussed and struck down a wealth tax many times. Weve accepted that though those who make more should pay more, they also should see long-term results of their perceived success. "
26906481805,"Listen to everyone, follow no one. Remember this guy has more money than all of us combined. There have been countless intelligent conversations that convey what he is saying, yet hes the one we see on interviews that make national headlines."
26906481990,"Isnt this exactly what the whole I am the 99% thing came from? ..... why is this news again, I thought we had already learned this/had loads of protests"
26906482764,"The problem here is that so many people are convinced that people pointing out these inequalities consider the arguments to be in favor of a redistribution of wealth. That is not the case for most. The issue isnt that they make lots of money, it is that theyve stacked the deck to KEEP their money at the cost of the lower income people. We dont need redistribution, we need equal costs across the board. Tax the rich as you tax the poor. No loopholes, no offshoring, no breaks."
26906482805,Thats a pretty safe comment given that the 85 million poorest are likely at $0. 
26906483714,Plutocracy
26906485148,"I wouldnt want the nations wealth with the poorest, no more then the rich"
26906485189,You people make him sound so intelligent

26906515698,Link to [interview](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24648651)
26906518748,"Dear Mr. Brand, When the uprising you call for actually occurs, the rabble will be coming for YOUR head, too. Youre like *rich*, and stuff. Love, The Rabble, Inc."
26906520509,"I think a better way to phrase this tiny group has as much money as this huge group of people would be to say it like Imagine the 300 richest people in America have an average of $85 million each, while the poorest 85 million Americans have an average of $300 to their name. Maybe thats more complicated than the former."
26906521450,Has this really changed in the past 4000 years? What makes people think things would be different in our times?
26906523166,"So can we get a list of these 300 people and get started? I mean theyve all got access to us, so why dont get get some access to them?"
26906524984,Oh thank goodness that bipolar drug addicted alcoholic comedians from England are now weighing in on Americas financial situation. 
26906525935,"This revolution has been going on for years, and its a little sad to know that the first time the world sees it is when a celebrity brings it to light. Dont get me wrong, he did an incredible thing. But maybe you should think twice before you dismiss activist journalists as conspiracy nuts."
26906527243,Why is this statistic in the form of a Russel Brand quote? What difference does it make that he said it? 
26906528270,"If you havent seen it, [I Am (2010)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1741225/) is highly recommended. Its a documentary by Tom Shadyac, the director of such hits as Bruce Almighty and Nutty Professor, about his own awakening."
26906529948,Could someone please explain this to me? Im not sure if Im reading it wrong or I just dont know what hes talking about.
26906530228,Is there something wrong with fact?
26906534954,Is this supposed to make me feel bad? Because it doesnt. There will always be rich &amp; poor; haves and have-nots.
26906536370,"Wow, that was horribly written..."
26906536465,"Russell Brand is an actor, stand up comedian, and radio host with a net worth of $15 million. Something about glass houses and stones or pots and kettles. I dont remember exactly."
26906536948,"If Russell Brand says, that, were not quite as egalitarian as he thinks... the bottom 60% have maybe 5% of the wealth."
26906538178,Is this news because some British dude said it? We all knew this.
26906539078,Thanks again voiceofrussia for this informative and non-biased Article!!
26906539877,"Funny to see this headline from a Russian news outlet, considering they have the largest divide between the rich and the poor, with 100 people representing &gt;35% of the nations wealth (richest 100 people in most other countries represent 1-2% or their nations wealth)."
26906543214,"Yeah, and theres plenty of people that make over 100k per year that have no wealth, and are included in that bucket, because they spend every dime they make."
26906547911,I really wish we would quit focusing on the wealth of others.
26906550762,"Can we stop glamorising russel brand now please? Hes right of course, but he has no solutions at all. Its infantile."
26906551383,Yawn. Why does anyone care what Russel Brand thinks?
26906552412,So glad someone finally said this.
26906553467,"I dont know if its been posted in here, but [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk) is the interview (10:46) its pretty good."
26906554331,Why do so many people on this thread think that some ridiculous actor is viewed by the US government as a threat? Nice try FSB. 
26906554441,"But of course, if you were to suggest those 300 might use the cash to influence politics its suddenly a Kooky Conspiracy Theory. I mean, obviously people with that kind of cash and world view wouldnt want to influence their own tax code in any way..."
26906555393,"I think if you look at revolutions, the rich or those in control of the revolutions will benefit from them monetarily. The average person will be the one to suffer. Violent revolutions are only sometimes good in the long run. "
26906560527,did anyone read the side stories linked to the voice of Russia... I think someone is rooting for Americas downfall. 
26906562136,"However the knee jerk policies and movements people always propose as the result if articles such as this never effect those three hundred, only the 10-20 million trapped between the rich and the poor working their asses off."
26906564835,"You know, I actually dont care that these 300 people eat 95% of the potluck. I really dont. However, I demand that they bring 95% of the potluck next time. They currently only bring something like 35-40% of it."
26906569295,"Its not the political system ¨C its the monetary system that causes this. And its not Republican or Democrat ¨C its far bigger than that. Its global, and its a monetary system designed to siphon wealth from the working class to the banks and governments who designed the system. In the end, it doesnt matter who you vote for, we have a monetary system that is built to enrich the banking class and the government at the expense of the working class. You cannot change this without changing the monetary system."
26906569894,"One thing Ive always wondered though is how does this compare to history on a per capita basis. Also, can some of it be attributed to exponential population growth? I mean in the 20s there were basically like 10 guys who literally owned all supply chains, and in medieval times kings probably did have a similar level of wealth."
26906572821,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk#t=306 Source. I am sure its here somewhere but I didnt see it 
26906574368,This is a big disingenuous seeing as about 4.2million american households have a negative net worth that is negative. So if I have $0.25 in my pocket I already have a net worth greater then about 11million people. I cant find the statistic anymore but I remember reading something that 1/3 of the country has a net worth of less then $100k
26906579157,"No doubt that society isnt as just as it should be, but framing revolution as inevitable because the global situation has been steadily deteriorating for generations is simply not true. Though it doesnt feel like it because we are in it, current society is going through an unprecedented time of peace and prosperity. Does that mean everything is perfect? No. But it also doesnt mean that things are on a steady path of deterioration that current political systems cannot possibly rectify. His main concerns of income inequality and climate change could be fixed in the US with a simple change: altering campaign finance. If moneyed interest didnt have so much influence, these things would be solved already. Is campaign finance change impossible? Absolutely not. It was already done by McCain-Fiengold. The SCOTUS struck a lot of that down. Does that mean it could never pass again? Absolutely not. If there were popular support, we could amend the Constitution to fix this. Thats not easy, but easy isnt the point. The point is the system can in fact handle these problems. The people (citizens who dont participate in democracy to help their own situation) are the broken ones. The problems arent fixed because they arent smart enough or working hard enough to fix them. "
26906583421,Russell came back hard from that drug binge to be a pretty enlightened individual.
26906586239,"The title is exactly the same situation as Louis XVI and the Court of Versailles. All you need is a serious financial crunch where mothers cant feed their babies and people will come with torches to the homes of those 300 demanding they pay. Im just saying history. If the rich do not learn from the past and realize they need the poor to have a basic level of living, and that they actually profit more from a strong middle class, they are bound to repeat it. Now do I foresee guillotines? No. Do I see them being dragged out of their beds at midnight by groups and forced to walk miles to the local jail? Maybe. Do I see hackers stripping their offshore and local bank accounts down to zero, selling their investments and giving it to everyone else? Maybe. Could I see a group collectively destroying all college debt records at sallie mae, down to the tape backups? Maybe. Theres this thing in nature. If an equilibrium between an entity and its environmental is not obtained on its own, the environment will destroy the entity in order to create the equilibrium itself. Its been throughout history, from a microscopic level, to the largest animals in the world. But without addressing the poor, and things constantly getting worse for them while they continue to play money games on who has the bigger bank account and the largest yacht WILL eventually provoke a reaction. Im just reciting history. Maybe theyll get smart, fix things and prevent it from happening, but I seriously doubt it."
26906587934,my question to that fact is....so what?
26906588422,Cant we all just be happy with what we have? Dam
26906590172,"Ok Russell, lets start with you. Begin re-distributing your massive wealth to the poorest in the US right now. Youre only allowed to keep 1% of . Get started, I dont have all day"
26906590770,All the money in the US is either spent pacifying the populous or collecting money into giant economically useless piles. This is why even people who exclusively subsist off of food stamps almost all have smart phones.
26906591872,Why is Russel Brand getting credit for quoting statistics used in popular social science books? And why is he everywhere on reddit today?
26906592984,"What an extreme contrast of ideas and generations, Paxman seems like he honestly doesnt get it. Russell Brand explains it all so well and these are the same issues Kanye West has been talking about, too. There is no reason not to take these people seriously because we label them as entertainers, our current constructs on where authority and power come from are extremely outdated and narrow-minded. People can literally be and do ANYTHING. There is no reason to continue to promote the current systems in place throughout the world when we have the massive amount of tools, knowledge and resources to make it all so much better. The only thing holding us back is the fact that a select elite are holding onto their ability to gouge the majority of the population for their time and money, granting them power."

And you could spin this all you want, the poorest in the U.S. are worse off than the poorest in India, because no one loans money to the poorest in India.

26906799648,"This issue is one of the ones I am most passionate about. We have finally reached that point where there is too much derived capital in the world. The simplest explanation is this: Capital is a finite resource. Think of all the money in a certain economy as a slices of a pie, every time you add more money to the system the individual slice of pie shrinks in its overall % (value). Corporations that grow billions of dollars in financial products do so at the expense of the purchasing power of the dollar. We as a nation must start taxing derived wealth at a higher rate to give more equity to the dollar. Money as a rule generally travels up the SES chain. if you think about how you spend your money, youre usually paying for something from an entity with a higher net worth than yourself. If we make it harder for people to conjure money from derivatives we simultaneously increase the purchasing power of the dollar. Its time to tax the shit out of capital gains or at least make the capital gains definition less broad. Doing this and reinstating the payroll tax holiday on a permanent basis would do more for the economy than anything weve done to date. "

If you vote for either of the 2 most popular parties in the upcoming elections in 2016, you will be voting for a person that puts corporations ahead of citizens. We must have a real, honest person that is willing to do what is right for America. The two dominant parties answer to corporations and work for them first and foremost. The idea of voting for the lesser of 2 evils will not help us. A revolution is absolutely necessary. As George Carlin said so succinctly: They got us by the balls! (this is coming from someone who has voted in the past 3 elections Ive been eligible for and at this point, Im fed up and wont be complicit in this corporate political system)."

26906859997,"Hes twisting things a bit, but thats his persona. If you have $10 in your pocket and no debt, you also have more than the poorest 85 million americans combined."
26906868211,"While this might seem callous but it may eventually come down to this. People have killed for much much less than a million and we are talking about the most powerful and influential people in the US, if not the world. The collective wealth of the top 1% can buy countries. Except for the few who made their wealth in their lifetime, and understand what it means to be poor, the majority of the top 1% are far removed from normal peoples lives. Such wealth are not usually accumulated in one lifetime, as such these people simply cannot possibly imagine what it means to be poor, middle class. So lets top pretending that these people are like regular joes. They are not. What they do know is their lifestyle and the power they command. They create this system to benefit them and as a collective will work to maintain the status quo, if not, skewed it even more to their advantage. They will not give up their privilege without a fight and they have a lot of weapons in their arsenal. But what about the rest of us? The middle class is disappearing, the poor becomes poorer and jobs are getting harder to come by. Work become more stressful. Raising a family is getting harder and more expensive. You are living paycheck to paycheck, if you have a job. You look into your bank account and realized you have not enough money to even pay off the mortgage next month, much less saving for retirement, even less for college fund for your kids. You realized the dire situation you are in but there pretty much nothing you can do. Everyone around just keep saying to suck it up, rich people deserve their wealth blah blah as you see your government just keep kowtowing to special interests, the powerful and the wealthy. Eventually, possibly in the near future, the wealth distribution will get to a point that no one can ignore the obvious. Most of us will be living in hovels while across the grass divide are grand mansions. There is something wrong with this country. People becomes desperate, crimes soar as organized crimes ravaged the cities and police are less about serving the public and more about keeping the masses from the vandalizing the ten feet tall glided fence of the mansions. Entire neighborhood falls into lawlessness. Votings are rigged. Politicians are bought off. Corruptions reach new dizzying heights. Nothing really gets done in the government. All the while, the wealthy and powerful keep chugging along, oblivious to the disaster brewing around them. Let them eat cake. Then something happened, its probably very small; a botched robbery on a rich guys daughter, a protest turned violent as the a riot policeman misfired into the crowd. The poor goes wild as the sheer indignity and hopelessness translated into a real symbol and the wealthy and powerful reacted with typical ignorance, fear and brutality. So what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. An explosion. Lynching on the streets, walls are scaled, rich people are dragged out of their beds and burned alive while their daughters and wives are raped. Everything falls into anarchy as criminals took advantage of the chaos to crave themselves private kingdoms. The nation military was used to suppress the revolt. As central command falls, some commanders too, used this time to crave out their little countries as warlords. Some continue to fight for the government, some abandon the chains of command and declare the illegality of the government. All hell broke loose. One thing the wealthy and powerful and the rest of us have to understand is that such scenarios happened all time throughout history. It happened usually when there was such a skewed distribution of power, not just wealth. The wealthy became so insular and shielded to the problems of the wider world and continue to make things worse as they take and take to a point where the rest of population simply could not tolerate it anymore. Granted, to make people actually died for a cause like a revolution, you have to make people have nothing to lose and we are far from that point. However, we are at the point of the first part of this scenario. Our voting power keeps getting evaporated. The government is in stasis, unable to solve even the simplest problems because any measure that hurts the wealthy and powerful in the slightest never gets pass in the legislative. More and more people are losing their wealth and social mobility upwards grinds to a halt as people are unable to save and invest, much less putting their kids through college."

Rich people dissapear, and you have even less jobs. Everyones poor. Illogical to think redistribution could ever work, long term. "
26906892512,"Viva La Revolucion, Baby! Seriously looking forward to this. Maybe we can get back to where we were before Reagan and Bush destroyed the middle class at the behest of corporate America by undermining our unions. The worst thing that ever happened to this country was the Republicans and their racist pseudo Christian majority feeling threatened by a minority that was starting to make money through unions. Why should Blacks (dont call them African Americans because that would mean we admit that slavery was a bad thing) and Hispanics be paid the same as white people the republicans ask? Seriously, this was a discussion in church when I was a kid. The Christian Conservative Right is no more than a thinly veiled KKK offshoot."
26906893440,who knew the poor people had so much money
26906896014,"Rich people arent the problem (i hate saying rich people because thats a meaningless generalization), money is the problem... and money isnt going anywhere. Money can buy anything; votes, laws, armies... Hell in america, money is used to brainwash so many people into voting against their own interests. Money buys power, its always been this way and we can all wish for utopian societies but that aint gonna happen. The best we can do is look at countries where people seem the happiest, where things like a free education and universal healthcare arent even up for debate, and do the best we can to adapt that model to our respective countries. PS: forgive my english, its not exactly my first language."
26906922374,Americans even outsource their reloutionary leaders. 
26906926369,Quite the circle jerk
26906929458,"Consider though, that an extremely wealthy philanthopist such as Bill Gates, will do far more to improve the quality of life for humankind than if such wealth was distributed evenly throughout society. Say you suddenly made 5% more money. Would you funnel most of that to charity or other social causes? Unlikely. And even if you did, it wouldnt be in an efficient, goal-directed manner, you would have to go through existing charities, regardless of their performance. So the problem is not that there are extremely wealthy people. Its that most of them are not using that wealth to help society. One could even argue that it is better to have a fewer number of people with wealth, so it is clear who is not doing good for society. Add in too many layers of indirection, like government, and no one has a clue who is really at fault for our slow decline. "
26906932178,"I find it amazing how quickly you all turn to violent means of revolution. Its like an unaccounted fantasy...American identity is so contingent on violence and conquest, its interesting to see the thoughts on this, although I know none of it will be acted out. Maybe we should be focusing our efforts on different agents of change which will spark off real political discussion in the wider community (as opposed to just reddit) - protests are the first steps to any real change. "
26906932869,"But unless Ive misread op doesnt say revolution is coming. He is replying to a comment that suggests revolution happens just as often as the second coming. Point is the first is frequent, the second is not so much."
26906938151,"Im of the firm opinion that a revolt is not possible at least in the US and that the only way we will see change is marginally. The only way to improve the current system is by active participation. By that I mean governmental participation. A large, progressive wing of the Congress as stubborn as the Tea Party is necessary to push it in the right direction. Unfortunately, many smart liberal types opt for simpler lives in the private sector and do not have as much ambition for power. Thats my theory anyway. Happy to see Brand voice his opinion. "
26906943374,An oligarchy of plutocrats. Degradation of Regimes anyone?

26906945617,"2/3 of all wealth in America comes directly from inheritance. Most wealthy people, that is, did absolutely nothing to earn their wealth. If you adjust business success rate by existing wealth, the earned wealth comes almost entirely from inherited advantage."

26906947531,Well ya. People with mortgages and student loans have negative worth. This isnt shocking.
26906962610,Probably doesnt change too much if you take 300 middle class individuals combined income and compare it to all the homeless in the United states.

26907180249,"Theres nothing to discredit or shame, guys. He has no concept of economics. While hes eloquent and well-spoken, his argument hold little value. Massive wealth redistribution and heavy taxation of corporations would destroy any sort of living comfort anybody has. We would all be living in government housing projects surviving on food rations. Profits should be eliminated? Thats the icing on the cake in this uninformed rant. No profits = no business = no jobs = extreme poverty. Please, for all of our sakes, read a little bit and get a firm understanding of economics before hailing this man as a revolutionary. Try to get past the fancy words and pleasing speech patterns."

26726777161,"Politifacts primary problem is that it creates very imaginative interpretations of the comments it rates. Then, any rating is achievable; a generous reinterpretation leads to True ratings and an absurdly restricted interpretation leads to False ratings for the original comment. And as a general rule this bias breaks down along partisan lines. The site does backflips to forgive Republican statements and closes its eyes while condemning Democrats. They especially love to say of Democrats that their statements are _factually true_ but then observe some other truth outside the scope of that statement. So you see, their totally true statement was not the whole truth because it did not mention that the sky is blue, so it is therefore false/less-than-true. The wiki article on politifact has some good examples. Some of my favorites: Democrats claimed Republicans want to end Medicare __as we know it__ (emphasis added) Despite some of their articles discussing [what as we know it means](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/aug/23/did-republicans-vote-end-medicare-we-know-it/), Politifact concludes that because Republicans are not ending Medicare--it will survive in some form new and better--the Democratic claim is [False](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/20/lie-year-democrats-claims-republicans-voted-end-me/). [2012 state of the union](http://www.politifact.com/obamajobs/): Obama is correct on both counts... So we rate the statement Half True. in 29 states you can be fired for being gay is only [half true](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/07/martina-navratilova/martina-navratilova-says-you-can-be-fired-being-ga/) because even though that is legal (the only thing the claim described), your employer still might choose not to fire you. Romney called for $5 trillion in tax cuts, but claimed he would not put it in place if he could not find a way to pay for it. Thus Politifact concludes it is onlny [Half-True](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-says-romneys-plan-5-trillion-tax-cut/) to claim Romney called for $5 trillion in tax cuts but hadnt offered any specifics on how hed pay for it. Obama claimed his budget plans saved $4 trillion. But to reach that conclusion you have to count money Obama has already saved on top of what his future proposals would save.

121827081,"http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/20j6dl/the_future_of_america/ The Future of America... Got this forwarded to me in an email, thought it was an interesting view towards whats occurring in America right now. Let me know what you think of it In 1887 Alexander Tyler, a Scottish history professor at the University of Edinburgh , had this to say about the fall of the Athenian Republic some 2,000 years prior: A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse over loose fiscal policy, (which is) always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the worlds greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to complacency; From complacency to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage. The Obituary follows: Born 1776, Died 2012 It doesnt hurt to read this several times. Professor Joseph Olson of Hamline University School of Law in St. Paul , Minnesota , points out some interesting facts concerning the last Presidential election: Number of States won by: Obama: 19 Romney: 29 Square miles of land won by: Obama: 580,000 Romney: 2,427,000 Population of counties won by: Obama: 127 million Romney: 143 million Murder rate per 100,000 residents in counties won by: Obama: 13.2 Romney: 2.1 Professor Olson adds: In aggregate, the map of the .territory Romney won was mostly the land owned by the taxpaying citizens of the country. Obama territory mostly encompassed those citizens living in low income tenements and living off various forms of government welfare... Olson believes the United States is now somewhere between the complacency and apathy phase of Professor Tylers definition of democracy, with some forty percent of the nations population already having reached the governmental dependency phase.. If Congress grants amnesty and citizenship to twenty million criminal invaders called illegal¡¯s - and they vote - then we can say goodbye to the USA in fewer than five years. "

Even the new ID card system in the UK is not free - [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_Cards_Act_2006#Costs).
26928358541,"I dont drive but I have a provisional drivers licence that works as an ID, all I had to do for that was pass the theory test which was incredibly easy compared to my home country. Im a legal immigrant so I cant vote anyway but the process of getting an ID in USA was simple. &gt;Keep in mind that no one is saying that voter ID laws make it impossible for most people to vote. Instead, the laws suppress the turnout of certain groups by making voting inconvenient for them. These groups (women, the poor, etc) tend to vote Democratic, which makes the whole thing somewhat suspicious. To be honest if someone cant be bothered with something simple like getting an ID to vote can they be bothered to even research the candidates/laws that are being voted on? I think voting is a serious thing which shouldnt be approached lightly. We recently had a voting here in CO and even though I cant vote I did a lot of research about the proposed new laws. &gt;Of course, the other thing to remember is that these laws are combating a non-existent problem.

26928353063,"The difference is that most countries have a national ID, and no such thing exists in the US. Getting an ID can actually be fairly difficult, especially if one doesnt drive, doesnt live close to a DMV, or cant make it to the DMV during the (sometimes extremely limited) open hours. Plus, as the link says, even having an ID isnt always enough. In Texas, for example, it needs to show your current name, which is often not the case on married womens drivers licenses. The net result is that **34% of voting-age women do not have the required ID**--which shows that it is definitely not a basic thing that everyone has. Keep in mind that no one is saying that voter ID laws make it impossible for most people to vote. Instead, the laws suppress the turnout of certain groups by making voting inconvenient for them.

26978600492,its true for some people. but the most basic preventative care that nearly everyone takes advantage of is the annual or semi-annual checkup where you piss into a cup and do a blood test. those 2 tests can catch a lot of catastrophic illnesses before they are serious and save a lot of future costs. same goes for tests like prostate exams and mammograms when you are older.
26978590755,"The cost of services themselves arent being affected so much as the cost of insurance.

Most of the burden falls on taxpayers, with the government providing tens of billions of dollars annually to help hospitals care for the uninsured.

Singapore. in singapore, the govt requires you to contribute a certain % of income. then the govt provides a safety net for everything that the personal savings cant cover (includes both catastrophic and non-catastrophic). also, everyone pretty much still has private insurance. but its the public form that drives healthcare coverage.

Thats to say nothing of the potential actions that Saddam himself could have inflicted on his neighboring countries as his situation grew more desperate, with or without WMDs (and there is some evidence he was pursuing them, even if he didnt have any at the time). On top of that, the potential turmoil caused by a collapse of Saddams regime was a very real threat to the entire area as Iraq stands between a lot of countries who genuinely hate each other (before even factoring Israel into the mix). Reasonable people can disagree on whether war was the correct action. And only the most blind Neo-Con loyalists will say that the execution of the war has been anything other than horribly inept. But to say that the regime posed no threat to anyone is simply idiotically ahistorical.

Second, from factcheck.org A majority of federal spending is exempt from the sequester cuts, so the parts that are not will be cut much more deeply than that. For example, defense spending (other than for military personnel) will be cut by 8 percent across the board, and nondefense discretionary spending will be cut by between 5 percent and 6 percent. So defense spending was cut the hardest, most of the government is exempt, and those that arent are cut by 5 - 6 %. How is this so horrible? "

If I can average the collective opinions and arguments made that Ive seen into the most likely cause, average citizens buying all they can. A couple that Ive read go into pretty good detail about how they came to that conclusion. Citing the publicly available numbers from various government agencies and it seems to average that they bought 1,000-1,500 rounds per agent that has a firearm per year. Which is close to their normal purchasing amounts. Sure there is speculation about purchases off the books or at least kept secret from public documents, but the lack of ammo still heavily points towards citizens buying them all. Personally, I know several people that make their weekly rounds to places that sell ammo and buy pretty much as much as they can every time. And they are regularly saying that shelves are bare, or at least the caliber they are looking for. In my preferred caliber, Ive not been able to purchase any in a good 3 months or more. Shelves are just bare, Ive seen a few here and there but for other calibers. I could order online some fancy ones that are $1+ per round, I choose not to spend that much. "

No one seems to care anymore about that they have these huge ammo stockpiles.

OBAMA: Let me just finish, because this is an important policy point. **We put in a catastrophic reinsurance plan that will help reduce those premiums for families by an average of about $2,500 per year**. Look, Ive already pointed out that said promise needs to be put in the context of Obama pushing a Universal Health Care law that was grossly different than the one that got passed. He was making that pledge before he was even the official nominee, for Petes sake. **Of course** we have to take into account the reality of the widespread opposition to his plan and how that shaped the final ACA bill.

The quote Im familiar with people citing is detailed here http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/521/cut-cost-typical-familys-health-insurance-premium-/ ... and again the quote says cut the cost of a typical familys premium by **up to** $2,500 a year (emphasis mine).

26710754851,"Im no fan of Nugent, but you can love your country and be against conscription. Especially when its used like the USA has used it."
26710755366,"Its projection. People like Nugent and Limbaugh - who both refused to serve in Vietnam and now support all these needless wars in the ME - know theyre complete and utter cowards. Theyre ashamed and feel the need to make up for it, particularly by seeming all macho and shit, like Nugent does with his tough-guy attitude and his scary-looking guns. So they project these feelings onto Obama, a guy who never served at all in the military (much less chickened out and dodged a draft), and call HIM the coward. To me, you lose the right to say we should go to war the second you dodge a draft. You also lose the right to call yourself a patriot who loves his country when you threaten to leave it if the democratically-elected leader you dont like gets into office. You had the chance to fight for your country and blew it, so accept that youre a goddamn pussy and just stop being an asshole."
26710748069,"Ted Nugent, Hero Patriot. From *High Times* magazine, October 1977. High Times: How did you get out of the draft? Ted Nugent: Ted was a young boy, appearing to be a hippie but quite opposite in fact, working hard and playing hard, playing rock and roll like a deviant. People would question my sanity, I played so much. So I got my notice to be in the draft. Do you think I was gonna lay down my guitar and go play army? Give me a break! I was busy doin it to it. I had a career Jack. If I was walkin around, hippying down, getting loaded and pickin my ass like your common curs, Id say Hey yeah, go in the army. Beats the poop out of scuffin around in the gutters. But I wasnt a gutter dog. I was a hard workin, motherfuckin rock and roll musician. I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and Id drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up. See, I approached the whole thing like, Ted Nugent, cool hard-workin dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces. Im gonna play their own game, and Im gonna destroy em. Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss. I was ill. And three or four days before, I started stayin awake. I was close to death, but I was in control. I was extremely antidrug as Ive always been, but I snorted some crystal methedrine. Talk about one wounded motherfucker. A guy put up four lines, and it was for all four of us, but I didnt know and Im vacuuming that poop right up. I was a walking, talking hunk of human poop. I was six-foot-three of sin. So the guys took me down to the physical, and my nerves, my emotions were distraught. I was not a good person. I was wounded. But as painful and nauseous as it was -- cause I was really into bein clean and on the ball -- I made gutter swine hippies look like football players. I was deviano. So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldnt believe the smell. They were ridiculin me and pushin me around and I was cryin, but all the time I was laughin to myself. When they stuck the needle in my arm for the blood test I passed out, and when I came to they were kicking me into the wall. Then they made everybody take off their pants, and I did, and this sergeant says, Oh my God, put those back on! You fuckin swine you! Then they had a urine test and I couldnt piss, But my poop was just like ooze, man, so I poop in the cup and put it on the counter. I had poop on my hand and my arm. The guy almost puked. I was so proud. I knew I had these chumps beat. The last thing I remember was wakin up in the ear test booth and they were sweepin up. So I went home and cleaned up. They took a putty knife to me. I got the street rats out of my hair, ate some good steaks, beans, potatoes, cottage cheese, milk. A couple of days and I was ready to kick ass. And in the mail I got this big juicy 4-F. Theyd call dead people before theyd call my ass. But you know the funny thing about it? Id make an incredible army man. Id be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and Id have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin killers youd ever seen in my platoon. But I just wasnt into it. I was too busy doin my own thing, you know?

But their not, are they. Theyre at home, drinking every night and sleeping in every morning. Being a soldier isnt about death, killing or war; its about service. Helping your fellow soldier stay the fuck alive, its not fucking easy and no one notices your effort. Ever. Celebrities get praises for every fucking thing they do, soldiers just keep working. Thats why Muhammad Ali didnt join, thats why all these hollywood pricks dont join. Its hard, and no one notices. He lost 7 soldiers under his watch in Afgan, in his career. None of which are famous, none of which will have statues in their names. Yet Ted Nugent gets to act like he knows anything about service. What a tosser"

Whether or not Ted Nugent is a coward has no bearing on his opinion on Barack Obamas responsibility in his role as President to help stem soldiers suicides. Barack Obama is partially responsible, in his role as President, for the suicides of soldiers because among other reasons he oversees Veterans Administration hospitals which are basically giving a big fuck you to soldiers. Its the same story that it ever was."

26710687772,The fact that you bash nugent for blaming Obama and then turn around and do the same thing he did by blaming it on the republicians is funny to me. When you understand that it is our Government as a whole that has sent our troops to a strange country to get killed over money and power then you will be qualified to write an article. Look at other countries and how the leaders get into physical altercations over what they are trying to do or get passed. Then look at our scumbags in suits voting themselves raises and making themselves exempt from crap healthcare. We have become Rome we just need a gladiator show on occasion to make us happy.

26710728559,"Sorry to break it to some of you, but going to kill 3rd world peasants in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan does not mean that you dont love your country. All it means is that you dont feel like shooting 3rd world peasants in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan for some random politicians. The pentagon spends BILLIONS each year on promoting the virtue of being a soldier and serving, but maybe you should think about it a bit more and determine for yourself whether you are helping or hurting, and who you are actually serving.

26710741364,"This is the worst double standard from liberals Ive ever seen. It was Vietnam. Lots of people did crazy shit not to go to Vietnam. Dont hold it against someone who dodged the draft to avoid going to Vietnam. Its was a reasonable thing to do, and it doesnt make you a traitor or a coward, nor does it make it hypocritical to stand up for the country. Hate Nugent because hes a tool, not because he avoided going to one of the worst and most senseless conflicts in the 20th century."
26710741876,so you are too cowardly not to serve the government special interests and kill yourself in a rich mans war? I think the Nuge is appreciative of the poor fools who think they are serving their country- but was smart enough not to do it himself. 
26710742291,"I would do anything to avoid going to war. Not that I dont love and respect those who do, but Im too cowardly to go to war."
26710742464,"Its true, Ted Nugent hasnt killed anyone - unlike that great hero of the Left [Bernardine Dohrn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardine_Dohrn), who was responsible for the deaths of cops and occasionally their own whacko lefties (out of incompetence). Brave, brave Bernadine. If only Ted could be more like her, and build bombs to blow up the innocent, the Left would love him."
26710743174,TL;DR: Ted Nugent is a hypocrite pussy.

Are we really going to go ahead and call every conscientious objector to that embarrassing and revolting episode a coward, or just when its somebody we dont like?

26710750727,And the worst title of the year award goes to...
26710751599,But? How is this a but sentence? He was too cowardly to serve (which is a bullshit way to phrase that) /and/ he blames Obama for their suicides. If he believes that government is responsible in some way for soldier suicides then it is perfectly consistent that he wouldnt want to serve.
26710751842,"He did serve the nation he loved by not getting suckered into that waste of lives known as the Vietnam War, to be called a baby killer and spat upon by the leftards of the time. If you downvote, I assume you thought the Vietnam War was a good idea."
26710752217,you can be against war but for the soldiers and victims of that war... just sayin. maybe motherfucker didnt wanna hunt humans... either way i could give a fuck less if he died tomorrow.

26710765765,Avoiding the draft doesnt make anyone less of a patriot. The United States military stopped being about defense a *long* time ago.
26710768122,Got you in a stranglehold baby!
26710768828,Only cowards cozy up to cowards he might get a dose of reality if he visited a Army hospital. Just shows how far batshit republicanism has gone.
26710768882,Ted Nugent is a dick. 
26710770081,"Regarding the post title, saying ted is cowardly because he wouldnt enlist. Well, you may call us cowardly, but those of us who would refuse to sacrifice our one only life for a body of land, but maybe we are the only ones thinking intelligently."
26710770979,"Of course Ted Nugent is an idiot, but judging his arguments by his actions is just plain stupid. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#Tu_quoque"
26710771263,How are these two things related?
26710771304,Twas a long time ago.
26710774257,AMA The Nooooge
26710774682,Anybody criticizing or judging Nugent for draft dodging is about as intelligent as Nugent calling Obama a nazi or born America hater.
26710775414,Nobody should ever have to justify their decision to not be part of a killing machine.
26710776317,"From wikipedia: &gt;In 2006, an interviewer from the British newspaper The Independent questioned Nugent about a 1977 interview in High Times magazine in which Nugent admitted taking steps to avoid the Vietnam draft. In the interview Nugent says, contrary to the story in High Times, that I had a 1Y [student deferment]. I enrolled at Oakland Community College. Nugent also stated he made up the story because the High Times reporter was gullible."
26710776530,"Hes a typical good-for-nothing, right wing chicken hawk. Act tough, talk tough but when its his time to serve he reveals how much of a pussy he really is. Id love to see people throw Depends adult diapers at him whenever he performs in concert."
26710776549,"Yeah, yeah, Ted Nugent (whoever that is) is a nutjob, but I think the real question for everyone reading this is why havent I unsubscribed from r/politics?"
26710777008,How many years have you served OP?
26710777126,Dodging a draft is brave no matter how you do it.
26710777278,"If I was in the service and obama was my commander in chief, Id kill myself too."
26710778057,"Seriously, just fuck everything about Ted Nugent. In the world of politics hes irrelevent."
26710779185,Whatever. Fuck murica.. Fuck Obama. And whatever it takes to stay out of war! The people who go to war are the reason wars still continue. Nugent speaks the truth. Wake up.
26710781041,Shouldnt this read Ted Nugent was too cowardly to serve **and** he blames Obama for Veterans suicides? Those positions seem pretty consistent; I dont want to fight and I feel sorry for those that have.
26710781251,"This is no different than plucking any other anonymous hillbilly out of the Ozarks and asking him what he thinks of the Ay-rab in the Presidents office. If Nugent hadnt enjoyed some modest fame from writing a few mediocre rock tunes 30+ years ago, we wouldnt even know who this guy is. Box him up with the other Good Old Boys and focus on commentary that matters."
26710783472,ted should just STFU and play stranglehold. they didnt call him the madman of motor city for no apparent reason. this article acts like we all should be surprised.
26710784099,umm...so what? Obama was too cowardly to serve as well. Nugent spends a lot of his free time associating with troops and getting to know them. Obama just sends them to die in pointless wars or marches them on stage for photo ops or to sell stupid people on more legislation. Fuck liberal hypocrites!
26710786220,"A real tough guy. Dont forget self-admitting to being a pedophile, adopting his under age girlfriend, and chewing gum with his mouth open."
26710787014,He should do commercials for depends.
26710787487,Annnnnd your point is!?
26710787517,Aaaaannnd Fuck Ted Nugent.
26710787861,Who gives a shit about what this draft dodging chicken hawk thinks?
26710788714,"On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, I give this article 10 crossbows. "
26710790904,You mean old poop and pee pants nugent? Lets make that a thing now.
26710791071,I would do the same. Smart guy.
26710792703,Id rather urinate and defecate in my pants for the rest of my fucking life than hunt and kill another human being you sociopaths. Edit: Nugent is a sociopath too. 
26710792799,This was actually false. I saw on 20/20 that he was allowed to miss military service because he was going to college. This is just some bullshit Dee Snider made up on his radio show.
26710794342,So he weaseled his way out of being a military dog and being a cog is a worthless war? Good on him.
26710796341,All I came here to say is that you can both love a country and be too scared to serve it.
26710797885,"Never had to experience actively hunting and killing another human being? More than half of troop suicides are done before the person has gone off to combat. Im not saying its Obamas fault in any way, but the title is misleading."
26710798979,Did Obama ever serve?
26710799125,"What Ive learned from this title: * Avoiding an order from strangers to slaughter strangers for no cause of the American people is bad. * If you havent blindly answered the call of your masters, you cant complain about soldiers killing themselves."

26710802632,"Ted Nugents an idiot, sure, but this woefully written article harms the authors case . . . if he/she has one. Very hard to tell amid the canopy jungle of generalities and run-on sentences."
26710803336,Rubbish. Its not cowardly to avoid serving. Its quite stupid to put yourself into a position where you will be brainwashed and trained to kill and be killed. 
26710804088,"you stupid fucks, do you not understand he was a fucking teenager when he was drafted? how would you react? i mean grow the FUCK up and try and understand why someone would do something like this. and i hope youll be mature enough to realize that people change, what a fucking surprise someone can change their tune over a 10 year period.../r/politics is the a safe haven for some of the stupidest fucking people in the world."
26710804614,"&gt;When a person holds another person responsible for actions that are socially or morally irresponsible, and makes negative statements about the person that have no basis in fact, their blame is nothing more than sheer vitriol with the intent to incite opposition against the blameless party. Are they describing Alan Grayson? This sounds like Alan Grayson? Its Alan Grayson, isnt it? &gt;The effects and harm the Iraq War has caused this nation will plague Americans for generations Not as much as progressive welfare policies are plaguing black families in this country. These PoliticusUSA articles are hilarious. The writers should work for the Onion."
26710805571,Obama hasnt had to do any of those things either. And he ignores it when other people doing it for him need his help.
26710807121,I think we can all agree that Great White Buffalo was a good enough song to overlook all that nonsense 
26710807661,"I went to high school with a guy who emulated Ted Nugent: played electric guitar, covered Nuges songs, hunted, etc. His girlfriend would regularly come to school with bruises on her body or concealed on her face. Not making it up and it doesnt prove anything; just thought Id share."
26710808391,"typical left wing hack job without a name. If you cant attack the message, attack the messenger. Hey author....you want to hold someone responsible for a past indiscretion? What did you write about Robert Byrd. Dem senator for 51 years! Ex KKK member? "
26710809500,That argument is weak and stupid.
26710810791,Why compare Ted Nugent to Obama. Obama didnt serve either? lol..
26710812672,"I wish we could make this a thing and see of we can troll Ted Nugent at speaking events and pressers with this question Ted, thanks for taking the question, huge fan of yours, is it true that you urinated and defecated yourself in order to avoid the draft? I want to force a recursive circle jerk among his audience using this talking point and liberal media conspiracy. "

26710819841,That does it. Im going to chuck out my Ted Nugent Best of C-30 cassette. 
26710819959,Dear Ted Nugent and Rush Lim (I dont care how its spelled) - Kindly fuck off- or each other. That is all. 
26710820025,"No idea who ted nugget is but you dont have to join the army to ove your country, some people just arent cut it for it"
26710820517,"The Nudge is a total dingleberry, you should flush turds, not hold them in your hands and say look at how much of a turd this is. Also LOTS of people dodged the draft in vietnam. Nobody will talk about it, except for the celebrities. Youre probably related to one. It certainly dosent mean they shouldnt have a politial opinion. Im a veteran and I for one do not Lord that fact over other people as if I have an heir of superiority. Hate because hes a moron, but dont convolute the argument with a decision he made 50 fucking years ago. I think this issue with the Obama Administration and veteran suicides is being made by alot of Liberal and Conservatives alike. And to make this a devisive issue, they wheel out bow and arrow draft dodger and do a story about him. And not the Dean veterans and their surviving families. Real classy. "
26710820806,Going to war isnt serving your country. Do something useful instead.
26710820887,Ted Nugent has done more good than Obama. Saying that Obama was the reason could be a drastic measure but dont talk like Ted Nugent is the coward of the world because hes not. We have others things to do than sit here and point fingers
26710821157,"Nugent says that he made up the stuff about soiling himself to get a medical deferment. He does, however, admit that he went to college instead of going to serve his country. He is a typical example of someone bellowing from the sidelines to whom no-one would pay any attention were it not for his rock star status. All my life I have been baffled by the idea that we should listen to a sportsman or pop star or other celebrity on matters not related to their experience and expertise. The correct response to ol Ted, it seems to me, is Yeah, whatever. Make some more fucking music, or retire already. But *shut the fuck up* about politics."

26710824203,The current Republican Party consists of three words: NO. BLAME OBAMA.
26710825725,"discussion on right wing politics is fucking pointless, discussion about left ideas is important. what the fuck is wrong with never having experienced actively hunting and killing human beings? whats wrong with reacting the way he did to the possibility of going to a war and dieing? why is it so bad to protest killing other humans?"
26710826755,"&gt; Ted Nugent Was Too Cowardly to Serve... That was one of the few *smart* and *honorable* things Nugent has done! Going like a sheep to the slaughter to fight in Vietnam was in itself not bravery. Once in Vietnam, some soldiers did brave things, thats true. But the acts of getting a physical and going into the military was not bravery, it was just fulfilling social expectations. The people that refused to fight in Vietnam were also brave -- they were risking being locked up in a cage by a brutal govt who wanted to wage war and kill people of another country, all because the US govt broke an intl agreement to hold elections in Vietnam because the CIA correctly reported that the communist leader and Vietnamese natl hero Ho Chi Minh would easily win any free and fair election. So the US backed a Catholic dictator in a Buddhist country and waged war to keep the puppet govt in power. As another brave man, Muhammad Ali, said when he gave up the heavyweight championship of the world and refused to fight in Vietnam, I will not go 10,000 miles from here to help murder and kill another poor people simply to continue the domination of white slave masters over the darker people of the earth. And fighting in Vietnam was not serving the American people! Fighting in Vietnam was merely serving a corrupt and brutal govt -- the war *impoverished* the American people and cost the US govt so much money that Richard Nixon had to detach the US dollar from the gold standard to cause inflation it inflate away the massive costs/debt of the war. &gt; I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class thug for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. -- USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, winner of 2 Congressional Medals of Honor."
26710829912,"He served his nation in the capacity of entertainer. Its not cowardly, in my opinion, to avoid harming human beings at the behest of another. It is the opposite. Heroic. "
26710830357,"This is a stupid headline and a stupid argument. Avoiding service is in no way related to veterans advocacy. In fact, theyre arguably consistent: if you think soldiers have it rough then youd be more likely to advocate for soldiers interests and youd also do everything you damned could in order to avoid becoming one."
26710830419,Dodging an unjust war by refusing to become a slave is bad?
26710831016,What the fuck does this have to do with politics?
26710833441,"Wait, so Nugent doesnt die in a bullshit war initiated by the US by a bullshit incident that didnt even happen (Gulf of Tonkin) and continues to do his own thing. But hes not allowed to criticize how soldiers today have to deal with mental problems brought on by (what the majority of people claim) is an unnecessary war. Im not enlisted am I allowed to criticize? Can we find out the names of some average Joes who dodged as well? Oh yea, thats not a fucking news story. Why dont we help the Veterans? And everyone else affected by mental illness?"
26710834460,"Its not just Obamas fault. He is presiding over and perpetuating a state of futile and useless war, started by Bush. Furthermore, we call these men and women heroes when we send them over there to fight so our corporations can acquire natural resources, aka liberation. Once they come back, we forget about them. If we are a democracy or a republic, then we the people are to blame more than anyone. This bullshit wont stop until we undergo a mass transformation. Everyone should watch the documentary Ghetto Physics."
26710836662,"&gt;I disagree with current policy but anyone who actually avoids enforcing that policy when called in a draft is a bad person. How dare he simultaneously disagree with policy AND do everything in his power to avoid enforcing it. What a disgusting human being, right guys? "
26710836788,I hate when people act like being drafted into vietnam was some kind of noble calling and every american male should be honored to serve his country in such a way. Fuck that. Id shit my pants too. Its just annoying to see people act high and mighty when it serves their argument--trying to make a proponent of guns look bad--when in reality they dont even support the thing he attempted to escape from 40-50 years ago
26710838326,In no way was the Vietnam War a service to America. Avoiding the draft was the patriotic thing to do. There is nothing more unamerican than conscription. 
26710840103,"I know a guy who is a reserve in the Marines but he has never seen combat because he is a suicide risk. Yet he talks shit and thinks hes better than everyone else because he has the title of Marine. No respect for those types of people. Its fucking cowardly IMO. Ill admit that Im a pussy and I would never put my life on the line for this country. But if youre gonna join the service, man the fuck up or get the fuck out."

26710843290,Umm wouldnt you try to dodge the draft if you had to serve in the bullshit war known as Vietnam? 
26710843687,This is just a distraction from the real issues. Like Nugents pedophilia.
26710843695,Why cant this guy die already...
26710843896,"sooo lemme get this straight, a guy with enough sense to avoid being a pawn for morons, who want people to go commit acts of unthinking murderous violence, is getting a bad rap because he has pointed out that soldiers are committing suicide in ever growing numbers. That these soldiers have been made through orders to commit egregious acts of criminal violence against other humans in illegal wars to support a bunch of psychopathic greedy shit stains, and he is the one in the wrong?. i fucking despair.

26710844372,"The author is quick to judge Ted Nugent. As a veteran who never saw combat, Ill tell you that a very low percentage of us see any combat at all. That a deployment doesnt necessarily mean combat. And that just a deployment in itself can present all the stress and hardship needed to drive people/families on this route. Military families know this. Its the separation, and all the millions of problems that stem from it. Theres nothing wrong with advocating and trying to help. If I were him and dodged the draft, Id feel bad too."
26710845315,And what branch of the armed services did Obama serve in?
26710847517,Its funny because there were liberals in charge in Bush Government as well... Both parties are equally as crooked.

26710851182,1) He was too cowardly to serve. BUT 2) He blames Obama for Veterans suicide. How the fuck are these two statements related...? How is the fact that he was too cowardly to serve in the army related in any way or relevant to the fact that he thinks Obama is responsible for veterans who commit suicide? Am I just thick or does this title make very little sense?
26710851844,"I have never seen such a biased website. Theres a link for the GOPS War on women Obama ads everywhere, and Ted Nugent is also a horrible horrible NRA member.

If I ever met that piece of shit, Id try to take his manhood, but it wouldnt work because he has none to take. Shes probably a secret vegetarian. "
26710859412,"So the fuck what? Liberal darling Bill Clinton played the education deferment card and Chevy Chase pretended he was gay. A lot of people were draft dodgers in the 60s and 70s. Some became famous, some didnt. "

26710860296,"Please upvote for visibility to avoid misinformation I absolutely despise Ted Nugent but this story isnt actually true. Ted made up this story himself as a joke and then recanted years later. However, you cant blame OP because Its such a well known story and Nugent was the idiot that started it. He actually had a 1Y classification (student deferment) that allowed him to avoid the war, but when he was being interviewed in 1977 by High Times, he decided that he didnt like the reporter and thought he would be gullible enough to bite on a fake story. The rest is history. Tl;dr- This isnt a true story but Nugent is still an asshole and is the one who started the story in the first place."

26710870446,I am not a Ted Nugent fan but I dont see the correlation here. Do you have to have been a part of something to criticize its leadership? I would hope not. Otherwise everyone that has never been a republican can criticize them. If people didnt have opinions about shit they havent taken part in then reddit would be pretty dead.

26710876332,"The story is not entirely true, he recanted the draft dodging story saying he was screwing with the interviewer. The official records show he had a student deferment for 2 years and was reclassified then rejected as a result of a medical exam, and reclassified as a 1Y. As medical records are protected it is unknown why the exam rejected him.

26710890686,"I also blame obama for vet suicides only because he continues needless wars, being the commander-in-chief. I also think ted is a total dingbat. On a similar note, I cant wait until GenX-Y starts running things and we can move past this false left-right paradigm."

26710893978,How is this political?
26710895531,"A. Now that the Pentagon itself has said a national draft is a Bad Idea and only wants volunteers for the forces (volunteers consisting of poor kids with minimal ability to go upward in economic class) people feel safe in mocking those who would avoid the draft. Make no mistake. Many would be copying his technique if a draft came up. Ive heard worse stories from my mom, who watched some friends get drafted out of high school. B. If we dont do something to alieviate climate change, well all be suffering like this guy. "

26710912880,"Im amazed hes not dead or in jail like he said he would be. Wait never mind, No Im not."
26710918511,Ted Nugent could be a hypocrite and might be less of a patriot than he claims to be? Get outta here...
26710919783,His thinking was ahead of his time. Just like Mohammad Ali refused to kill people he dosnt know. Its fucked up that you can try link in killing Korean people that have nothing to do with you into how much you love your country. If anything he loves his country more by how upset he is that Veterans come back not able to integrate back into society. From a war that was never even won.

26710920216,"Ive always wondered why entertainment celebrities deserve the credit for being a spokesperson for our society? Regardless if a person can act, sing, or tell jokes, what credibility do they earn as a political pundit. I cant even stand 90% of the political pundits, who generally are just journalist with no or little real background in politics. Have any of these so call experts, sources, etc. ever ran for elected office? Been forced to chose between raising taxes or cutting services? Been responsible for protecting citizens by supporting or Police, Fire, EMS, Military, or cutting them when they become a onerous tax burden? Anyone one of these celebrities or journalists would be the first one to file a lawsuit against a government, when they slipped on dog poop left on the city sidewalk left by their own dog, and then complain about the cost of running government because insurance costs are so high! "

Lets do the reverse and see how well it flies with you Those who have been in the military, indoctrinated in it, and hunted humans should have NO SAY in military decisions! They are all warmongers and bloodthirsty dickbags who joined just to slaughter folks and want to perpetuate global war! Only those who havent been brain damaged by that shit are worth listening to! See how that is fucked up? "

But the fact that Obama has decimated the right to privacy of Americans (as did Bush before him), and increased our risk of more war in the Middle East, has sided coming and going with the Bankers over the people, has watched without comment or reaction as the Income Gap continues to grow... All of that is fact. Ted is scum. Okay. But that is no defense of Obama, unjust wars, and sending people to die for corporate interests."

26710929508,"Wow, this article could not have been more blatant about the writers Democratic fanaticism. Every sentence was worked to be anti-Republican in some way. Calling Nugent a gun fanatic as if it matters to the topic and making claims about how the Iraq War was solely for oil without presenting proof and worst of all, making implications that a Democratic Administration and President have never fucked the country over. Regardless of truth or fiction, regardless of Nugent being a draft dodging shit-talker, the article wasnt very credible or professional because of the way it was written. For clarification, I have no political party affiliation; I think both groups are idiotic."

26710938012,Cowardly is hiding when you should be fighting for something you believe in. Why would anyone in their right mind fight for something they dont believe in?
26710938032,"Ted Nugent annoys me almost as much as anyone, but since when do we conflate fighting in Vietnam as serving our country? Our country would have been better served if everyone told the politicians to fuck themselves and fight their own damn war -- as this country was intended."

26710947129,"Obama had the privilege of growing upin an era, like most of is, when the government did not come to make kids fight in die against their will. Not enough training, not enough equipment, and a war fought on false pretext, would you go because the government told you you had to?"
26710948505,"The key thing I hate about the gun debate is that people who are anti-control tends to be extremes in the debate. Ted is probably the worse possible person to put in as a front man for the gun debate. My opinion is that they should show the millions of normal people who own firearms, who served, and so fort as the real front people. The American public isnt like Ted who screams rhetoric at the president. We just want to own firearms, and do not believe that gun owners should be criminalized by something someone else did. Sort of like saying taking away cars because anyone can drive drunk."

26710952489,"First off, theres nothing wrong with avoiding the draft. The Vietnam War was bullshit and the draft for it was bullshit. Draft dodging isnt unpatriotic or cowardly. Second, what the hell does him dodging the draft have to do with his opinion on veteran suicides? Having an opinion on veteran suicides makes you an asshole now if you havent fought in a war? How does that make any sense? Third, his opinion on veteran suicides is retarded, but who gives a fuck? This thread/article is just as stupid. "
26710953700,"Ted Nugent is such an idiot, why does this even matter?"
26710954679,I cant really fault Nugent for avoiding Vietnam. I would have done the exact same thing. What I do fault Nugent for is that while he seems to have been pretty clear headed when he was young he has since become a fool. And not only a fool but a very cruel man.

26710974977,"The only reason this is news is because Ted doesnt lean towards the Left. There were a ton of draft dodgers back in the day, including Hendrix. Some people just arent fit to serve, and if theyre forced to, theyre just going to get someone killed. Been serving for almost 6 years now and you need to be sure that you have your buddys back and that they have yours. Its scary out there and you cant afford compromise. I dont blame Ted for blaming Obama. The majority of the people on the civilian side have no clue how the VA is these days. People not getting paid/treatment/etc. Vets are treated horribly these days, I see and hear it quite often."
26710982415,"I thought the whole thing about him shitting on himself was just a story for a radio show, Im pretty sure he avoided the draft because he was a student. Draft dodger or not hes still an idiot."
26710986263,"Seriously, WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THIS. The rate of suicide in the military is not any higher than it is in the regular civilian population. So lets stop fucking talking about it. The majority of the soldiers committing suicide HAVE NOT served in a combat role. A small minority of the suicides have been in combat. The main reasons for suicide in the military are the main reasons for suicide of a civilian. Money troubles, family troubles, wife troubles.

26711073887,Whats the big deal dodging a war that everyone knew was a dead end. Nugents an asshole but not because he dodged the draft. 
26711077992,Fuck Ted Nugent. 
26711079347,"The left on reddit &amp; IRL constantly bitch about useless wars, especially Vietnam. If Nugent were a lib, hed be a fucking hero to the same people calling him out here. While I agree that his actions are shameful and cowardly - the hypocrisy here is worth mentioning."
26711095328,"This entire thread is an ad hominem attack on Nugent. I challenge the OP to actually rebut the fact that Obama is responsible for vererans suicides. I dont blame Nugent or anyone else one bit for not wanting to get killed for a completely useless, immoral, unjustified, and illegal war like Vietnam. The left are so rabid in their defense of Obama that theyre willing to stoop to a completely fascist conservative pro-war position like this just to make a point of smearing someone who dislikes Obama."
26711136544,"OPs title reads as because Nugent is a shithead, Obama must be innocent. This is a cut and dry fallacy. How about this: Nugent is a terrible person. And Obama is also indirectly responsible for veteran suicides."

Businesses will just cut more peoples hours in half, and hire on others because itll be cheaper. Just like how they stupidly react to Obama care."
26831655448,"part time employees are covered too... anyone working 25 hours a week whos been there for 1 year would get the same benefit. what i find TRULY sad is that our corporations want to take over running the country, but they dont want the responsibility of actually taking care of the people. if you cant do the second, you sure as hell shouldnt be trying to do the first."
26831644424,"You can call them selfish or mean, but theyre hardly stupid -- it was Obama and the bill authors who were stupid to think if they said, You have to pay a lot more money to have a full time worker than a part time one that business owners werent going to get rid of full time workers and make them all part time."

26831726734,"Which is why we need federal regulations that eliminate the entire concept of full-time and part-time and just require that business owners offer a minimum level of benefits to their employees regardless of how many or how few hours they work, or else pay the financial penalty come tax time which will help fund the public exchanges. The whole full-time/part-time system exists solely to abuse workers. What other reason is there for it even to exist? To a job creator that hires hourly workers, whether they work 20 hours or 40 hours a week is immaterial to his bottom line in terms of the amount of work theyre doing, since hes paying them by the hour, its solely a matter of the ancillary benefits that weve rightly come to expect due to hundreds of years of history showing us that these things are required in first-world society. Either that, or peg the threshold between part- and full-time to something really low, like 8 hours per week. That way, scumbag Walmart *can* hire 5 times more people and employ them all for a single day if they want to push the matter to the absurd...but the required infrastructure the company would have to fund (just processing the payroll alone would take enormous amounts of manpower, they already have over a million employees, not to mention the logistical necessities of hiring more support personnel just to handle those employees) would far outweigh the financial benefit to them playing this stupid game in the first place."

When an employee has worked for more than 3 years it is increased and then at 10 years increased again until it is three weeks or 21 days in total, they holiday can be accrued over no more than 5 years and if you resign or are fired for any reason then they have to pay you for the days you are due.In the Uk this is even relevant for those people that work contract jobs."

26831919344,I fully agree.
26831844019,There really isnt any evidence a substantial amount of employers are doing anything because of ObamaCare. [Thats just right wing noise.](http://www.factcheck.org/2013/07/gop-mistweets-obamacare-survey-results/) 
26831800595,"Im not saying these are definitely good things especially in the short term, but over the long term I think reducing hours may be necessary and desirable. Thats only true if compensation and the safety net make reduced hours a livable situation. Contracting the labor market through reduced availability in time just might put upward pressure on wages as available domestic labor hours fall by 25% or more. Thats only true if people can live at those reduced hours though, which right now many cannot. Part-time at near minimum wage with a weak safety net wont cut it. Something sneakingly within the ACA situation though is that putting hour pressure on employers while still providing access to healthcare through subsidy may end up helpful. This puts people into the exchanges. The exchange insurance is subsidzed based on income. Effectively, it moves people away from employer health care towards a portability arrangement. The big flaws are if people are unable to live on their wages, they may fail to acquire coverage, the safety net may fail to adequately tax to cover costs and private ensurers are still in the mix taking too big a piece of the pie. However, in the here and now Im sure a lot of people will feel the pain of reduced hours. I think we shouldnt have tied hours to coverage by employers, but instead raised an insurance fund from hour 1 giving employees choice in how that fund was allocated to their health insurance. If they wanted to buy into the employer plan, an exchange plan, a state plan or whatever I think that would have been much better. Still, I think we have to withdraw hours from the labor market so long as there is one."

But eventually [everything has to be paid for.](http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0116/p01s01-usfp.html) Its even worse than you propose. Not only were none of the costs of the wars in the budget, they cut taxes to insure none of the costs could be paid at the time. It all went on the credit card so the next generation can pay for it. So not only will this generation get to pay their outrageous student loans, they can pay for two wars they only read about in history books. "
27130746415,"&gt; Not only were none of the costs of the wars in the budget, they cut taxes to insure none of the costs could be paid at the time. It all went on the credit card so the next generation can pay for it. That infuriates me. If Republicans were really as fiscally responsible as they claim, they would have raised taxes temporarily to pay for the wars. Not only did they never raise taxes, they even made sure that none of the spending for the wars even went into the normal budget (because that would make the deficit look worse at their hands), instead choosing to fund it solely through emergency appropriations measures, year after year. And whats sad is that the average citizen wasnt outraged. In fact, they were completely disengaged. "
27130760722,"And when they read about them, they read about them as a terrible GOP move that will cost the party a generation. And that generation will always be extremely skeptical of Republicans and diving into wars headfirst. Its already happening.

Actually, that would be 41.5%. I see math is not your strong suit. Now, your real issue is that youre making up numbers. Your claim of $5.97 trillion is fallacious.

I dont know, good question. But that fact alone doesnt disprove that he doesnt debate within his inner circle and experts. The books Ive read reach a consensus on this. For example, on drone strikes, he meets with the military folks, the ACLU, he has his liberal counsel [Harold Koh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hongju_Koh), and they discuss the matter. Does he do it for show? I sure dont get that impression. Does he equally satisfy each group? Hell no, but thats impossible to do, especially on such matters.

The most invasive government agency in the country had employees (both low level all the way to the top at least aware) of decisions based 100% on political motivations. Even if they only separated applications because the low level worker felt the groups including trap party and such were more likely to be denied, they still made decisions on how to process them based on that. They pre judged them. And 9/11/12 was and is a giant scandal that still has yet to be accounted for. On the eve of a presidential election, state department (appointed by the White House) employees made significant alterations to the intelligence statements to distract from the obvious and eventual facts. How far that goes or whos responsible can be debated, but it happened. Its not a fox news story. Its real. And the entire public was made to believe that 4 Americans were killed, and American soil attacked in the name of a YouTube video, while the state department and White House knew that to be false.

So, please, tell me where HuffingtonPost, or [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/barack-obama-white-house-transparency-101494.html), or [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/barack_obama_promised_transparency_the_white_house_is_as_opaque_secretive.html), or [Columbia Journalism Review](http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/cjp_report_on_us_press_freedom.php), or [Miami Herald](http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/01/15/3870483/us-spy-agencys-push-for-secrecy.html) are all wrong on their scathing reviews of the transparency of this administration. &gt;Maybe instead of making sweeping statements, you should go through the bullet points. Based on politifact, Obama has kept roughly 1/3 of his promises regarding transparency, compromised on 1/3, and failed to act on 1/3. Maybe turning a complex discussion into a rough count of how many items fall into each category does a shit job of illustrating the success or failure of the administration to provide transparency. Why the fuck would you equate Help students and their families become aware of college readiness on the same scale as Seek independent watchdog agency to investigate congressional ethics violations, and why do either of those have anything to do with the transparency of the administration? They are both having to do with transparency of completely different organizations. The politifact metric is yet another bullshit tactic to avoid discussing the reality of the problem. Youre a shill for the administration, and need to own up to that. "
27013385286,"&gt;modernizing process? launching data.gov? I dont think people were talking about getting their hands on traffic statistics APIs when they asked for transparency. Well if you actually go back a read Obamas campaign speeches, half of the transparency he specifically references is financial transparency. That was his most-often stated goal as far as open government. He wanted to make the statistics about how our government spends money available. &gt;Lets see what the right wing hate machine called Huffington Post has to say on it: Surely you dont think the political leanings of a news source validate its content. I thought we were having an intellectually honest discussion and not clouding are opinions with informal fallacies. &gt;Thats just one of the first that pops up when you search Obama transparency. His record has been abysmal, and completely counter to his campaign promises. Maybe instead of making sweeping statements, you should go through the bullet points. Based on politifact, Obama has kept roughly 1/3 of his promises regarding transparency, compromised on 1/3, and failed to act on 1/3. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/subjects/transparency/?page=1 And it remains that this administration is the most financially open administration in history.

You NEED these programs to be able to afford to work at fucking walmart. The only reason they can pay their employees (even the retarded ones) so little is because our tax money fills the massive void. Their business model is propped up by the welfare system."

27065060583,"OK, real question. What are we talking about here? what percent of their employees also draw welfare (how many) and how much? The reason I pose this question is that as much as I hate Walmart and will go to great lengths to avoid shopping there, I have been there. Every time Ive been there Ive crossed paths with employees working the aisles that were clearly special needs. Once I asked one of them a question and he ran off screaming. Not to be a jerk by stating the obvious, but these employees are clearly not equal quality to a normal minimum wage employee so Im guessing WM receives something for giving special needs people jobs (I dont know, just guessing) and is that what were talking about here?"
27065084692,"I believe I read that around 75% of Walmart employees are on some form of government aid (welfare, food stamps etc). With the amount of money they make in profit each year its a disgrace that they have employees that are not able to put food on the table for their families. "

I found something related to the [50%+ number](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/12/health-care-bill-bankruptcies/) that was thrown around during the original debate but apparently that statistic was from self-reported sources and included income loss from sickness. One of the critiques found something that may be interesting: Buried in the study is the fact that only **27 percent of the surveyed debtors had unreimbursed medical expenses exceeding $1,000** over the course of the two years prior to their bankruptcy. ¡­ Nobody likes to pay $1,000 in medical expenses even when they get two years to do it in, but for most Americans (particularly those with enough at stake to seek the protection of bankruptcy) it is not catastrophic.

Did you practice effective interviewing techniques? If you did not get very many interviews, it probably has to do with your resume. Did you get advice from as many people that you could on ways to beef up your resume? Cold-calling helps too; literally cold-call an HR department and/or recruiter. These people love persistence. Find a company you want to work for, then find an employee with some say there. Figure out what their email address is, and send it off. Repeat until a fish bites. Idk what else to say.

26962080422,"&gt;Republicans support tax cuts for everyone.

But so do Republicans. They want to let the payroll tax cut and the various stimulus tax credits (notably the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit) expire. Those are the tax cuts that primarily help poor and middle-class Americans. In fact, 87.8 percent of the payroll tax cuts benefits go to taxpayers making less than $200,000 and 99.9 percent of the stimulus tax credits benefits go to taxpayers making less than $200,000. "
26962241514,"&gt; Unless theyre busy claiming that 50% of people pay no taxes Its more than just a claim. [Its true](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/08/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-51-percent-american-households-pa/), in the case of [federal income taxes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-47-percent-americans-pay-no-income-tax/). &gt; fighting to end a temporary cut in the taxes that the lower classes actually do pay Thats an over-simplification, which boils down to a lie. In 2011, both parties wanted to keep the tax cuts, [the difference was over how to pay for it](http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/01/politics/congress-payroll-tax-cut/index.html). &gt; The price tag of the bill is about $265 billion, which would be paid for by the 3.25% surtax on annual income above $1 million, according to Democratic aides. Note that the plan was a 1 year payroll tax cut extension for a permanent tax hike, which was a nonstarter for Republicans. &gt; Meanwhile, the Senate Republican plan that also was blocked would continue the 4.2% payroll tax rate for a year and pay for it by imposing a three-year freeze on federal salaries and reducing the federal work force by 10% through replacing workers when they quit or retire. In addition, the plan would require Americans earning $750,000 a year or more to pay higher premiums for Medicare, and prevent millionaires from getting food stamps or unemployment compensation. They ultimately voted to [extend the cuts for two months](http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/22/politics/congress-payroll-tax-cut/), then [for a year](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/17/us-usa-taxes-payroll-idUSTRE81D1WM20120217). As far as I can tell, neither party was particularly keen on extending the temporary tax cut again. In September of last year, [Nancy Pelosi wanted the payroll tax cuts to expire](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/nancy-pelosi-payroll-tax-cut_n_1904838.html). In President Obamas reelection tax plan, he [wanted the payroll tax cut to expire](http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2012/10/25/what-is-barack-obamas-tax-plan/). The Presidents fiscal cliff proposal did include plans for extending the cut, but that was a farce, to provide a talking point against Republicans. As evidence of that, [the bill](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR00008:@@@S) never included any language to extend the payroll tax cut, not even a failed amendment. I also couldnt find anything to do with the payroll tax extension in any related House or Senate bills. As the final evidence of that, [Chris Hayes said](http://www.mrctv.org/videos/journolisters-klein-and-hayes-reveal-record-wh-briefing-detailing-pr-tax-strategy) in a conversation with Ezra Klein (the author of the article you linked) that the White House was willing to let the payroll tax cuts expire. Considering the payroll tax funds Social Security, it makes sense that the President and Pelosi would want the tax holiday to expire."

Thats exactly what we have in this society nowadays, and I specifically direct that towards my age group, people who are just pissed off because TV and their parents told them they were special, and now when it doesnt happen, somehow they feel entitled to greatness but arent willing to put the work. Anyways, you said it pretty well, everything about social security is a mess and it accounts for over 20% of the federal budget. Its something royally fucked up by politicians and I look forward to hearing their bullshit excuses."

If I dont have money for retirement, Im not going to blame the government. Plus, if I was penniless at retirement, Im not expected to survive off of SS anyway."
26913715296,Did I miss something? Whos talking about eliminating Social Security?
26913730977,"Theyre not investing it conservatively, theyre lending it to themselves through bond purchasing. And thanks to the Feds money machine, you get way less back in the end when you factor inflation."
26913741757,"&gt;Theyre taking money from us and investing it (very conservatively). Then, theyve borrowed from that money year after year after year. Now, theres nothing but IOUs The investments are in Treasury bonds. Perhaps the most conservative investment in the world. There is no stealing from the trust fund, the fund is simply invested into US debt, which essentially means that it is helping finance US spending. If that is stealing, then the bond market and other debt markets have been one giant scam for hundreds of years."
26913774012,"off-topic, but where were you raised? Ive never heard the term land up before but think its pretty nifty."
26913796465,Your assumptions are all wrong and that makes you an idiot with a stupid post.
26913829422,"What would you have them do? Put it in a bank account and leave it there doing nothing? That would have the same effect as burning the money and printing it again later. You cant eat dollar bills, after all. At this scale, savings is impossible."
26913809839,Youre a fool if you think the money youre putting into social security is invested at all and is earning income. It is simply stolen and sent to the thieves in Washington to promptly be used for some other program that needs money. 
26913827439,Its not being invested at all
26913753394,Social security is not an investment program. People getting their checks is not dependent on any portfolio making returns. Social security is a program created to prevent poverty in old age and disability.
26913697333,"Thats the thing I never understand. I didnt *earn* social security. This is my money that was collected and invested. Now granted, Ill assume that the money is invested in a very safe manner and is probably only earning 2% interest or some crap like that. Therefore Im sure there are those that land up taking out more than they put in, especially for those who land up living a long time. But some make it seem this is some gift given to me. Anytime a politician talks about eliminating the entitlement program of social security, I say, fine. Let me do some quick math. Assuming the money that Ive put in has earned 3% interest, in the 17 years Ive been working since graduating from college, my contribution should be up to $111,831.47. Cut a check for me in that amount (and cut a check for everyone else in the amount you owe them as well) then you can cancel this entitlement program. Theyre fucking scam artists. They want to make us think theyre doing us a favor. Theyre not. Theyre taking money from us and investing it (very conservatively). Then, theyve borrowed from that money year after year after year. Now, theres nothing but IOUs. So now theyre trying somehow to get from underneath their obligations. Theyre scum."
26913765620,Social security is not an investment. It is an insurance program. Payments to that insurance are premiums. You dont have a balance in an account. 
26913843284,"&gt; Ill assume that the money is invested in a very safe manner The money is spent as as it is received and it is replaced in the SS fund with govt IOUs whose market value is zero. Technically speaking, thats neither an investment nor safe."
26913815765,"Wait, you think they are saving your money for you and investing it? How amusing. That was the promise, but not the reality. Your money (and mine) goes into a general fund from which claims are paid. Our ability to get payments on our investment is ENTIRELY dependent on other people being there to pay in when we get to retirement age. By that time, the terms will VERY likely have changed significantly, including a later retirement age, decreased benefits and/or income caps (if you make more than $xxx,000 per year, you are responsible for your own retirement and are not entitled to any income from your investment. "
26913750464,"&gt; Thats the thing I never understand. I didnt earn social security. This is my money that was collected and invested. This is false. The money was collected, but it was not invested. It was transferred to someone else. In order to for you to receive money back from the system, they will have to collect it from someone down the line. Chances are those people havent even been born yet. Its a meaningful distinction, because if it were an actual investment account, youd get a lot more back than what social security can offer."

26913789189,"No you didnt earn your social security, at least not all of it. The overall benefit you receive is greater than overall tax you pay + 2% interest rate. When politicians talk about reducing entititlement, they are talking about reducing the net benefit (payment - (tax+interest)). I support social security because of the overall benefit it brings to the society, but lets not delude ourselves that people earned all of their social security.

So, this couple will be paid about one-third more in benefits than they paid in taxes. If a similar couple had retired in 1980, they would have gotten back almost three times what they put in.

26913740636,"Something to consider is that, with traditional investments, you are slowly taking money out of your nest-egg when you retire, so the returns on that money start going down. With SS, the payments slowly go up. I find it to be a great investment."
26914239046,"The first sentence of your first paragraph outlines the ideological understanding of the Social Security program. As a nation and society, we MUST protect our most vulnerable citizens---especially the elderly, who have contributed their lives to our society, and we must also protect our children who exist within our society out of pure circumstance. This is not to say that all other groups of vulnerable people are not deserving of social safety. ALL HUMAN BEINGS deserve protection, regardless of the opinions of the opulent masters. In our time of winner take all, profit over people corporate institutions, and amazing wealth of the ruling class, the very least you owe society is charity. Without charity, your success is nothing, and will not endure. Everything after the first sentence of your post is moot without understanding the will of the people to support government programs that we believe keep society strong."
26913712255,"The problem is that a lot of the social security fund is invested in US treasury bonds, money the government doesnt like paying back to the fund.

26914037100,"No, you just have no idea what you are talking about. Social Security has many programs. Retirement is one of them and it is not an entitlement, you worked for that. When you hear people Bitch about stopping the entitlement they are talking about SSI. People who have never worked a day in their miserable lives can go to the ssa office and claim a disability and apply and start collecting SSI even before the disability claim is processed and even if it is denied they can just appeal and refile over and over collecting the whole time. Except most get accepted...

26993063643,"You are being fooled by the whole competition state law bullshit. If you open up sales across states lines you will just start a race to the bottom. Do you know why all the credit card companies are pretty much all located in one state, it because that state has the laxest rules and regulations. Open up state laws and all the insurance companies will move to whatever state will let them sell worthless insurance and they will do just that. States have enacted individual health insurance laws because the insurance companies were just fucking their customers. If we had a better set of federal rules, they are much better now, but still favor the insurance companies more than they should, it might could work better, but that is why the insurance companies want to sell across state lines is to get out of certain states laws that actually require them to provide coverage and not just take your money. You will get cheaper rates sure, but do you really want the lack of coverage??"
26993045706,"Except that several area of health care (I wont go so far as to say all) are set up in a way that is uncompetitive, you dont get to choose what hospital to go to therefor there is no incentive to keep cost down, and on top of that in this current system there is a incentive towards reactive care, while preventative care is dis incentivized. I am all for competition, but you have to set it up in a framework that allows for it, as right now if you could pull it off without being caught there is a strong incentive to get your clients sick again and again"
26993061306,"&gt;secondly, i agree we need to make a change, so get the gov Bureaucracy out of it, the reason we are so fucked up to start with is because we basically have 50 mini monopolys for each states health insurance exchange.. open those lines up and costs will go down.. competition will fix this.. the reason it was fucked up is because health companies were allowed to lobby politicians to close state lines and drive up costs.. to line the politicans pockets and the insurance companies Yes, there was just too much regulation in health care before.

26876977469," No it is a problem of corporations. There is no way that the act could have picked a definition of part time. The corporation would have used any hours named, to cut health care. They do not care about employees. that remains the problem."

26876967830,"&gt; That is not the problem of the program. It is a problem of the corporations, No, its a problem of the program. People making rational financial choices based upon economic pressures created by legislation is what you would expect people to do.

26877190441,"Agreed. Everything looks at walmart and thinks its people like them that are screwing over their employees to pocket millions in profits. A friends girlfriend works at a deli. The owner has 3 locations. He often puts in 80+ hours himself. Hes no where near rich. Due to his number of employees, he was going to have to offer health insurance. He can not afford it. He legally sold the largest store to his wife, thus neither of them have over the limit of employees, thus they are now in the clear. "

26994088879,"&gt;Then they called it the 2013 lie of the year. Right. They called it the lie of the year because, as I said, it was a central focus of Obamas pitch of Obamacare to the American public, and the HHS rules for retaining grandfathered plans (which were implemented after the earlier reviews) were so restrictive that most plans could not remain grandfathered, and HHS knew most plans would not remain grandfathered. &gt;People are losing plans because insurance companies chose to cancel them, whether they were ACA compliant or not. Right, but most of the cancelled plans were cancelled because they would shortly no longer be considered qualified plans. The way youre stating it is as if insurers simply said we dont want to take your money anymore which is not even remotely the case. HHS knew their rules were prohibitively restrictive and they counted on it: &gt;We note that, as the Affordable Care Act is implemented, we expect grandfathered coverage to diminish, particularly in the individual market &gt;They didnt have to. There was a long transition period Right, and the rules were in place since 2010 . . . so cancelling plans in 2012/2013 is well into the transitional period. Even if they didnt wait until the last minute, its not as if insurers were clamoring to cancel plans. The vast majority waited to cancel until the marketplaces were open and people could use them to buy new insurance because they were not allowed to keep their existing plan."

I dont think its too much of a logical jump to say that this goes against the idea of If you like your plan, you can keep it. Period I guess you could try to squirm out of it and say that he thought you could keep your plan, it would just be priced out of reach, but Obama also said that The average family of 4 will save $2500 per year due to the ACA, which has also proven to be a lie in many cases. The combination of these lies make it pretty difficult for folks like you to spin your way out of it. Edit: I actaully went back and found a Politifact [article](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/barack-obama/obamas-plan-expands-existing-system/) from October 2008 where they rate the Lie of the Year for 2013 as bury the needle true. Not only does he say that if you like your plan you can keep it, he also goes on to say that the ACA will also lower the premiums on those plans. There is no way to spin out of this. Own it. "
26968838182,"As a liberal, and somewhat a great spinner in my own right, I honestly believe he knew. The inner dialogue goes like this (so that he can say it and honestly believe it): 1. If people want to keep their plans, they can keep it. 2. People wont want to keep plans that are barebones and incapable of preventing them from having a huge loss in the case that they have a real emergency, because people are more rational/practical than that, and if shown facts and reason they will want a plan that covers their needs than a theater of security. 3. So, because people wont want to keep the crappy plans, due to reason #2, reason #1 is truthful. *Now* - just because they reason it this way doesnt mean it is, in reality, true. People were fine with the plans, probably because they didnt know any better. But they were still happy with their plans and would have only have complained if they got legitimately sick and found out where the coverage ended. That happened quietly to too many people, and the ACA aims to stop that, but when people dont realize the limitations due to the intensely convoluted wording in the brokered agreements they liked their plans. So, in reality, it is quite a bit of a lie at best, and an intentional deception at worst. I still think there are plenty of other lies told by the administration that could have been used though."

26885538658,"This all reads like someone that either didnt really read up on what Obama was promising, or just someone that wants to give the old I totally supported him, but I am going to vote libertarian in the next election! The majority of things youve pointed out either was done, was stalled by a congress that (same as right now) refuse to cooperate with Democrats on fucking *anything*, or was never actually promised but accepted by truth because the Right Wing media portray it as absolute fact with a look how Obama has failed!!! &gt;TARP. No Bankers Jailed. (nuff said). [TARP was signed into law by Bush **and not** Obama](http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/was-tarp-passed-under-bush-or-obama/), and what specific laws did bankers actually break? (Unfortunately for us, dont be an asshole is not a law) &gt;Immediate end to Iraq war and drawdown in Af/Pak You cannot just pull thousands and thousands of troops out of a country without some kind of timetable in place - a timetable that was actually set by Bush in the [2008 US-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%E2%80%93Iraq_Status_of_Forces_Agreement). As for Afghanistan/Pakistan, President Obama actually campaigned on [stepping up those engagements](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/134/send-two-additional-brigades-to-afghanistan/) when he ran... so you are admitting that you originally voted for a man without (apparently) knowing what he was campaigning on. &gt;Ending Torture He [did end torture](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/175/end-the-use-of-torture/) (as far as we know). &gt;Green energy, stimulus, technology, etc. -&gt; These programs were funded to less than 10% of what was proposed, and had to cut ugly, ugly deals with the energy industry - resulting in BP Gulf Disaster, and Keystone. The president doesnt have carte blanche power to enact any kind of spending or tax credit he wants - the proposal that would have done what he promised was stopped by house republicans, something you really cant blame the President for. &gt;Single-Payer healthcare Like the green energy jobs above, this was also heavily edited by congressional republicans. &gt;End the drug war IIRC, there was no promise to end the drug war, but to treat drug addiction as a health problem, something that goes/went into effect with the PPACA. "
26885466223,"That all said, I still think Obama looks bad. I voted for him in 2008, because I thought he was going to make some changes. As it turned out, he either didnt have the will, or the power, to do anything substantial. (I am actually really happy for the gays though - congratulations you guys). I LITERALLY did not vote for him in 2012 because of how little of his previous progressive agenda he actually accomplished. Lets look at a list of things he did that were very much in opposition to his 2008 primary platform: 1. Financial/Banking reform -&gt; TARP. No Bankers Jailed. (nuff said). 2. Immediate end to Iraq war and drawdown in Af/Pak. -&gt; we still have tens of thousands of State Dept contractors in Iraq. Still troops in Af/Pak. + Libya, Yemen, Somalia, we narrowly avoided having to go into Syria. Seriously - fuck all this war shit. 3. Ending Torture. -&gt; Immunity from prosecution for Bush and Cheney. 4. Green energy, stimulus, technology, etc. -&gt; These programs were funded to less than 10% of what was proposed, and had to cut ugly, ugly deals with the energy industry - resulting in BP Gulf Disaster, and Keystone. 5. Single-Payer healthcare (distinctly different from Clintons Private Insurance Mandate plan) -&gt; we got Hillarys fucked up plan. 6. End the drug war. -&gt; ended up with: dialed-back fighting states in drug-war-rebellion. I dont know if 2014 is going to bring dems to the polls. And it sure doesnt matter if people want to vote for Obama in 2016. But progressives have really gotten nothing but the shaft from him."
26885555132,"Your list of issues include items passed before his election day, let alone his inauguration (TARP), but assumes items could be done just because he wanted it without support from the senate republicans (Green Energy stimulus/single payer). If you add to it that you referenced the Heritage Foundation plan as Hilarys, then I have only one way to view your post. Uninformed trolling is still trolling. EDIT: werds "

If we had a perfect system (which we obviously dont) would we still still say they were not productive because they didnt pass something? For the right, who is supposed to be for small government this could be considered the most productive/obstructive congress. Just sayin."
26813830714,So a good Congress is that which passes more bills? Does the content matter or just the sheer number? 
26814342605,"How much you want to bet republicans will say, Obama has signed the fewest bills in history!"
26813722804,"If all of these politicians that gripe about government overspending fought to end their own jobs, Id be impressed."
26814235981,"Surely when people began keeping track of these things was the *first* Congress, active 1789-1791. It appears they passed half a dozen laws and one constitutional amendment. In two years. Get your shit together, Washington Post. "

26814414801,"I like how the title talks about how Congress has been very counter-productive, which it has been.

Through the first 8 months of 2013, the House has passed just 22 bills that have been sent to President Obama. That¡¯s the smallest number of passed bills since people began keeping track of these things "
26813882273,Can we maybe stop judging the productivity of the legislative body by the number of laws they pass? Overlegislation comes from that shit.
26814761554,"Bad headline. Its a very bad idea to gauge productivity of Congress by the number of bills (ie new laws) they pass. I think it would be more disruptive to society if there was an ever annual increase to the number of bills passed, since society would not be able to keep up with them "
26814246872,Who needs more laws? I think they are doing better. 
26814293351,"Given the place is controlled buy the GOP that just want to fuck shit up (and have openly said so) this isnt a bad thing at all. How many laws of we really REQUIRE Congress to pass for the country to run. GOP promised distracted, less effective legislature and delivered! Now if they would return half their paychecks for not doing snu work, wed be all set. "
26813684890,TIL that more bills = better govt. Whodathunk it would be that simple?
26813922328,why is not passing new legislation considered bad?
26813673499,"Much as Id like to fault Boehner for a lot of stuff, a bill needs to pass *both* House and Senate to get to Obamas desk. So an absolute count says nothing more than Boenher and Reid disagree. A better metric would be to compare the ratio of bills reaching Obama to total bills passed for both House and Senate. That would give a much clearer measure of playing well with others. "
26813847833,"what was the last bill that they passed that wasnt either oppressive, pork laiden, or otherwise destructive and dishonest? hell, the people would be better off if they never came back into session, at this point."

26813802124,"And yet Boehner will still go on TV and bash Obamas approval rating and using it as evidence that he is the one holding the country back. Sorry little orange man, but what is congress approval rating at today? 17%?"
26814069384,"Heavily GOP controlled House vs heavily Democratic controlled Senate. Who didnt see this coming? Since neither side seems to be too concerned with individual liberty, a stalemate is the best I can hope for."

26813752075,Good. 
26814037004,&gt;This is the least productive Congress ever Couldnt even repeal Obamacare for the 50th time. Slackers! 
26813681671,Congress is not supposed to be a fucking assembly line churning out new laws. Measuring the productivity of the legislative system by how many bills it passes is shortsighted at best.
26813778052,Whats wrong with this? Why should they be judged on bills passed? You guys really want MORE laws?
26813910659,"Quite honestly, judging them on the number of new bills passed is stupid...... We have enough rules / laws / tax breaks / loopholes / pet projects / etc. And as much as this pains me, I would agree with Boehner to some extent. Part of their job SHOULD be to review existing legislation and get rid of stuff that doesnt apply anymore, etc, etc. Does that mean I feel that this Congress has done a good job? Fuck no. There have been many important issues that they have just dodged entirely and a ton of partisan bullshit...... "
26814153478,"Man, that sounds like an awesome job. Tons of money, not much work, and no one to really be accountable to."
26814211591,Do we need more bills passed? I mean really. 
26813739261,What a bizarre way of grading Congress. 
26814257796,"Be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it. Here in NC theyre steamrolling legislation through, and I know many here wish they werent being so productive"
26813635572,Good.
26813619961,This should come as no surprise. The Speaker of the House has already said we should not be judged on how many new laws we create. We ought to be judged on how many laws we repeal. So we should expect at least 937 more attempts at repealing the ACA before the end of 2014.
26813909745,Dont entirely blame the House. The Senate has equal responsibility in this since both side must pass a bill to get it to the Presidents desk.
26814089589,They really do believe in the Unitary Executive.
26814185321,"Is is me or is that a poor way to judge Congress? Congress was intentionally designed so very little legislation did get passed, thats why it has to go through the two houses and then has a chance of getting vetoed. Look at the police state. We want to be tough on crime because people want to see their tax dollars at work, but handing out speeding tickets to meet quotas isnt helping anyone. It inflates the numbers to say crime is being dealt with and justifies expanding the police force, but actually causes injustices in society. I say quality over quantity. Id rather a meth maker go down instead of 100 pot heads. You can criticize Congress for the student loan rate hikes, for gutting financial regulation, for toying with the idea of SOPA/PIPA, for renewing the PATRIOT Act, for playing chicken with our debt ceiling, etc. People are disappointed with Congress for failing to represent them and fight for their interests instead of some lobby or corp, not over the amount of legislation."
26814231698,"Nothing about this Congress is good. But passing a shit ton of bills doesnt make them good either. Why is it that were judging a Congress based on how many bills they have or have not passed, rather than judging them based on the ones they have? Or based on the success or failure of the bills theyve passed? This Congress has done a lot of terrible things, but passing too few bills isnt even measurable to the terrible ones that **have** been passed. Lets focus on those, then come back to this issue."
26813694187," Boehner says they should be judged by the laws they repealed instead of passed. Since they have repealed none, it is the worst congress ever. There is no standard you can brew that makes the Boner congress look good."
26813893736,"This Congress is embarrassing indeed, however the title of this post is a bit off. The **Congress** has passed just 22 bills that have been sent to Obama, not just the House."
26813768167,"Well now that the country has been turned over to Wall Street, what really is left for congress to do?"
26814381983,"Typical Reddit. If the GOP Congress had passed hundreds of bills from their agenda, then Im sure Reddit would be dancing in the streets. "
26813652844,"I need a listing of those 22 passed bills. My gut tells me 20 post office namings, repealing the ban on insider trading in Congress, and some kind of expanded powers for the NSA."
26813631340,Too busy repealing ACA &amp; stirring up horseshit scandals to be productive......oh &amp; hes black. 
26814015974,"Well, thats what happens when 16 per cent of eligible voters show up, as was the case in 2010. 18 goddamned Republican shitbags need to go. Only 18. The current bunch has as a strategic plan, the obstruction of bills, even popular and needed bills, so they can derail the black president from showing a productive term in office."
26813778017,I can imagine somewhere on the freerepublic forums they are saying least productive president ever.
26813817442,Because more than half of Congress won their votes by saying government doesnt work. The second they became part of government they tried very hard to make it not work. 
26813966053,who says passing bills is a good thing? 
26813821916,"Judging from the posts here, its basically the single-digit percentage of America who approves of a Congress thats getting nothing done (on purpose, I might add) that is in control of our country right now. Wow, thats scary."
26814516130,"term limits please - these people are not working for us, they are working to keep their plush government jobs..."
26813771741,"This is the single most important thing in America right now. Replace this congress and this Senate in 2014 or we are all doomed. There are enough smart, informed, loyal Americans left that we can elect the right politicians this time around. All but a handful of incumbents have to be replaced."
26813624791,And why is this necessarily a bad thing?
26814223648,I see nothing wrong with that...
26813960784,"Oh of course they dont pass very many bills. Everythings working perfectly, why would they need to change anything!?"
26814703402,"You elect Republicans, this is what you get. Nothing."
26813798733,Do congressmen and women still work during recess? I would like a 5 week vacation.
26814513840,The apple is rotten at the top!
26813743817,Shouldnt since people began keeping track of these things date back to the first time a bill was passed? So 1787 or so. I would hope we have a record of all bills to be passed by either chamber.
26814264112,7* months ftfy
26814095681,"Makes you wonder huh, if they passed 23 bills how the fuck are we still spending 4 trillion a year."
26813810112,"Good. The less they do, the better. "
26814039366,"I think a lot of people will think no laws is a good thing- but there are many laws that need to be passed just to keep things functioning. Appropriations bills are laws that need to be passed, so are authorization bills, to keep the government functioning. Most people dont realize how much good things, things that keep our society/economy functioning. So while I agree in some respects gridlock isnt always a bad thing but there are different degree of gridlock and the gridlock we are in now isnt a good type."
26814302522,it is a problem only if you assume every bill passed and signed is a good thing. or that we need every increasing numbers of laws
26813659727,Maybe we shouldnt be so mad about them being unproductive since when they do produce something it regardless of party it usually sucks. 
26814167111,"Its pathetic, and its fueled by a do nothing public. "
26813633161,And why does this even matter? Obama has been using Executive Order to bypass congress so much so that he doesnt even need congress to do their job.

26813709005,"This is not a bug, it is a feature. Less chance for them to fuck things up. When they actually repeal more laws than they pass, thatll be true progress toward freedom."
26813712483,Good. The less shitty ideas they try and turn into laws the better!
26813721312,"Considering the kind of bills they would pass, I dont have a big problem with this. Now if only they were more effective at oversight."
26813724162,Not making more stupid rules and regulations is a bad thing? Sounds pretty great to me!
26813732227,And when did passing new laws become a productive measure??
26813737379,"At this point, does anyone really want these jerkoffs to pass any bills? Two bills that I can think off the top of my head that they managed to pass were SOPA and CISPA. Again, does anyone REALLY want these people passing bills? Because I sure as hell dont!"
26813739686,Why are people complaining about this? Congressional inaction is FAR preferable to Congressional action.
26813742133,"Im actually okay with a less productive federal government. The less they get done, the less they can mess things up more. "
26813759377,"Since Obama has taken over passing laws via executive order, there simply is no need for congress to be productive anymore. Stop complaining! Heil Obama!"
26813774989,Good.
26813790840,Good. Every time they do something we the people suffer.
26813791912,"Dont assume the passage of more laws is inherently a good thing. No mans life, liberty, or property are safe while he legislature is in session. Gideon J. Tucker"
26813797068,"I am actually happy these idiots havent passed many laws. I dont think they should be passing laws until they fix the garbage laws they have put in place. Such as Patriot Act. DMCA. The patent office needs an overhaul. Etc. I am sure you can think of some of your own. See, I dont mind them not passing laws so long as they revise the current ones, and take a long hard look to see how those laws have affected peoples lives in a negative manner. "

26813800783,Good now lets keep going until we start repealing bad laws
26813802304,"So, theyve done the least to expand government than any other Congress on record? Hooray, I guess?"
26813803936,Perhaps we should consider outsourcing their jobs while theyre on vacation.
26813830632,"Good. Obama wouldnt sign anything worthwhile, and what he would sign we dont want."
26813831259,That just means America is almost perfect!
26813840148,What liberal decided that Congress is a law-making factory to be judged by volume? What if things were going just great? Should they just keep cranking out new laws? Why? And if things are going shitty (like now) why should they pass laws that have a chance of being signed by the guy whose policies just make things *more* shitty?
26813843496,Good. The less bills the government can pass the better. Everything they touch turns into shit. 
26813867378,"And yet, Obama will blame Republicans, youll all fall for it, and keep voting for the guy with the D by their name. Or, youll get mad, and vote for someone with an R by their name. How about you vote for someone whos voting record you actually looked up? someone who stood by what they said theyd do, instead of blaming others? Oh, and heres a nice site for you to look up the voting records of politicians. www.ontheissues.org"
26813870257,"Did anyone ever stop to think that maybe its a GOOD thing that our legislators arent continuing to over legislate the living shit out of everything. Seriously... we dont need new laws every week. How about we repeal some stuff? get dumb laws off the books, reduce the cluttered and completely unenforceable littany of laws we already have - maybe update them, instead of passing new ones? I think people dont realize how little we actually need from congress. FFS how many (essentially) duplicate laws do we have?"
26813873888,I love the caveat sent to President Obama implying an unproductive house when in reality it is Harry Reids senate that wont get anything done. This however is not a bad thing. That we have convinced ourselves that counting pages of laws and regulations coming from legislation as some sort of positive measure is very disturbing.
26813885635,"YEAH!!!!! The congress that passes the fewest laws, commits the least violence. If the 22 bills they passed hadnt been bi-partisan examples of crony capitalism, and had instead been bills like the anti-spying bill, and the perhaps some bills to prevent drone strikes of children and American citizens, then perhaps they could do even less violence!!"
26813892291,"Funny how people think more laws are a good thing, and that the measure of a good Congress is somehow directly related to the number of bills they pass. We have plenty of laws. Too many, in fact. The focus of Congress must be on whether they accomplish their basic duties in an effective manner. Based on the last several years, its clear they arent, especially in the Senate - [which couldnt pass a budget for more than three years...](http://www.politifact.com/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/28/bob-corker/bob-corker-says-senate-has-not-passed-budget-more-/)"

26813968777,Good. The less they do the less they fuck shit up

Severely damaging the US economy is wonderful for their goals: It clearly demonstrates that government is bad, and they preach for smaller government. If the American peoples memories fail to extend for more than 6 months, as they often do, then the best thing they can do to get more Republicans elected is to have a weak economy that they can blame on the current party. Even indirectly, it helps them get elected because the more people distrust government, the more they lean Republican. And finally, even if you dont believe they are specifically racist, a minority is still in the white house and they want history to remember minorities as failed leaders for the benefit of their own partys image.

So be it. Im sure there is a significant difference and requires special training and education in each speciality. Yet he compares the U.S. national economy to his small business. Household and business economics is called microeconomics; national economics falls under the category of macroeconomics. Both are valid specialities within the field of economics, but you cannot apply business economics to national economies any more than you can use techniques used for kittens for treating a cow. Some of macroeconomics is counterintuitive and has absolutely no comparison to microeconomics. Just as I wouldnt rely on myself to medically treat an animal, Rep. Yoho should seek and rely on the advice of a trained and educated economist for economic advice."

They think that if you removed the Fed, or that if the US defaulted than all would shift in a positive way. The debt would be brought under control, the dollar would regain strength, and the economy would return to some picturesque past that never really existed. The reality would be very different, and could shake the foundation of our economic and political systems. This is why it will not be breached. There are too many vested interests in the current system to see it crashed so flippantly. I am all for the end of a private central bank, and the end of infinite growth economics.

26887960215,"None of that will probably happen though, even if the debt ceiling deadline is reached without a resolution. Moodys and S&amp;P have both stated they will only downgrade US credit if the treasury fails to make its next coupon payment - which is at the end of October. Now, the treasury has several options in the case of a debt ceiling crisis. Come end of October, they must pay roughly $6 B of coupon payments to sovereign debt holders, but they also must pay off roughly $50 B in other payments. The Treasury only has about $30 B, so here are their options: 1. Sales of assets. Treasury believes this would be very unfair for taxpayers. 2. Across the board Payment Cuts. Its almost impossible to make line item payment cuts (due to the millions of single payments the treasury makes a month), so an alternative solution is to make across the board payment cuts - basically, paying 96% of every bill that becomes due, leaving 4% to pay later. 3. Privatization of coupon payments. This wont happen for reasons I can elaborate on later. 4. Temporary delays across the board. If we reach Oct 18 and the Treasury has $50 B of bills to pay and they only have $30 B, then this plan prescribes them to delay any payments (except for coupon payments) until they have the $50 B necessary to make the full payment. Effectively, no matter what happens, the US Treasury department will pay the coupon payments, thus alleviating a technical US Default. There are many other things to be worried about that I could touch upon - like the high probability that banks would begin charging negative interest rates on deposits if they see a flight of safety of investors from money market funds and short-term securities, to banks....

I know this because I am day trader, and keeping a very close eye on the market, and the fear of the banks and big business is very real. Its also important to note that politically, I am a Marxist (and I say that in a loving and proud way) so I am more to the left then most of you, but that does not change what is going on in the market. We are not entitled to our own facts. To put it simply, the world has agreed to use the USD as global currency. This means everyone in the world is willing to take their payment in USD because it is seen as stable currency. If the confidence in USD falls apart, in the chaos that follows, at least in the short term, Japan banks could want to sell gold, but only accepting Yen. A European bank could want to buy gold, but to buy into Yen, to make the trade possible, would send the Yen skyrocketing making the gold more expensive. Essentially, the global currency situation breaks down into a global bartering system, where you hope you have what they are willing to accept. The extra transaction cost would freeze up the market. The market is freaking out, because there is no real way to hedge against a US default. It is completely off the playbook and no one knows how the market will react, or even if there will be a market to come back to. Even though as a small investor, I have am making good money on market fears, even I plan to get out of the way when the actual default deadline nears. Furthermore, large financial institutions cant move like small investors can. They need to worry about maintaining market stability when they sell. And to truely get away from default risk, they pretty much have to sell everything. The loss of liquidity that would be triggered by a default could mean that Goldman Sacks will actually have to hold on to the physical corn they bought futures for and cant sale. A sign of the confusion in the market can be seen through gold. Although the US dollar has been dropping, gold is dropping with it, which is counter to all normal market wisdom. In fact gold, at time of writing is around a 3 month low, even with the weak dollar. This is because no one knows what to do. tl:dr The market is really freaking out about default because it would mean we will have to refine what we mean by market. "

Simply by imposing a ceiling they are arguably violating the Constitution. Debt Ceilings and government shutdowns are exactly why this amendment was enacted - to stop these horrendous political shit shows that make us look bad. We need to breach this false debt ceiling to abolish it once and for all and restore the public debt to its constitutional footing. "

26887590309,"Mr. President, I rise today to talk about Americas debt problem. The fact that we are here today to debate raising Americas debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government cant pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Governments reckless fiscal policies. Over the past 5 years, our federal debt has increased by $3.5 trillion to $8.6 trillion. That is trillion with a T. That is money that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, borrowed from China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers. And over the next 5 years, between now and 2011, the Presidents budget will increase the debt by almost another $3.5 trillion. Numbers that large are sometimes hard to understand. Some people may wonder why they matter. Here is why: This year, the Federal Government will spend $220 billion on interest. That is more money to pay interest on our national debt than well spend on Medicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. That is more money to pay interest on our debt this year than we will spend on education, homeland security, transportation, and veterans benefits combined. It is more money in one year than we are likely to spend to rebuild the devastated gulf coast in a way that honors the best of America. And the cost of our debt is one of the fastest growing expenses in the Federal budget. This rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, robbing our cities and States of critical investments in infrastructure like bridges, ports, and levees; robbing our families and our children of critical investments in education and health care reform; robbing our seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on. Every dollar we pay in interest is a dollar that is not going to investment in Americas priorities. Instead, interest payments are a significant tax on all Americans  a debt tax that Washington doesnt want to talk about. If Washington were serious about honest tax relief in this country, we would see an effort to reduce our national debt by returning to responsible fiscal policies. But we are not doing that. Despite repeated efforts by Senators Conrad and Feingold, the Senate continues to reject a return to the commonsense Pay-go rules that used to apply. Previously, Pay-go rules applied both to increases in mandatory spending and to tax cuts. The Senate had to abide by the commonsense budgeting principle of balancing expenses and revenues. Unfortunately, the principle was abandoned, and now the demands of budget discipline apply only to spending. As a result, tax breaks have not been paid for by reductions in Federal spending, and thus the only way to pay for them has been to increase our deficit to historically high levels and borrow more and more money. Now we have to pay for those tax breaks plus the cost of borrowing for them. Instead of reducing the deficit, as some people claimed, the fiscal policies of this administration and its allies in Congress will add more than $600 million in debt for each of the next 5 years. That is why I will once again cosponsor the Pay-go amendment and continue to hope that my colleagues will return to a smart rule that has worked in the past and can work again. Our debt also matters internationally. My friend, the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, likes to remind us that it took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up only $1 trillion of foreign-held debt. This administration did more than that in just 5 years. Now, there is nothing wrong with borrowing from foreign countries. But we must remember that the more we depend on foreign nations to lend us money, the more our economic security is tied to the whims of foreign leaders whose interests might not be aligned with ours. Increasing Americas debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that the buck stops here. Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserv"

As an annual federal expense, the interest on the debt is a daunting figure (its over 400 billion) but the US takes in ~$3tn through taxes and fees every year. In order to default on the debt, the US would have to stop paying that interest. Not going to happen. Seriously, this is a Fox News-level partisan circlejerk. While its true that we could be in serious trouble if the interest rate goes up, some of us have been saying that for years and have been ignored by conservatives *and liberals* alike. To me, it sure seems like this is more political lever than legitimate concern. "

26887635510,"in reality it isnt a big deal unless the president breaks the law, which I suppose is a distinct possibility. The federal government takes in more than enough money per day to pay its bills and this includes interest on debt. By law the president must pay the bills first. There is no risk of default. So in reality, not raising the debt ceiling is not the crisis the liberals are trying to make it. One would hope they do not just raise the debt ceiling and instead recognize the massive problem we have with spending and end it. The more debt we have, the more beholden we are to the one holding the loan."

Ill take a shitload of that and then when things get back to normal in a year, itll have jumped to $150 and Ill be smiling. Most people in the stock market are bad investors and buy things when they are high and sell as soon as they start to fall in price. A lot of the smart investors out there make a killing because of recessions by properly valuating companies. Not only that, with a lack of credit and investors pulling money from the market a lot of companies that were struggling a little or were getting ready to make a move to grow their business suddenly find themselves in a much worse place. Creating less competition for the corporations that invested money into the candidates they support, which in turn gives them more market share and more money. After the newest supreme court decision goes inevitably anti campaign finance reform, then those congressmen not only pocket the money from the gains they made in the stock market when it recovers, but they also get larger donations to their campaign to help them stay in office.

Failing to raise the debt ceiling will not cause us to default unless Obama chooses to default, which would be an unconstitutional action. Its on him. Dont tell me the government has no waste to cut. Furthermore, the concept of having a law that sets a limit on something and then raising that limit every chance possible is ludicrous. Get rid of the debt ceiling, or abide by it.

26887826706,"I think we all know that this shutdown is a bit of a political show. In fact the government is still paying themselves, i.e. still working, which means this will get resolved...but not without some pain for the people who are hugely impacted and actually not working. Of course, collateral damage is justified in war and isnt our political process a perfect parallel? On another note, the housing market has become very accustomed to extremely low interest rates which arent helping the economy bounce back. And just recently the markets fully expected Bernanke to raise the interest rates, but he didnt. Now that Yellen will be the new Fed Chair, it would make sense to manufacture disruption in the government while jacking up the interest rates in the process. If raising the rates is seen as a byproduct of government shutdown then there really isnt any one to blame for it. Sure the GOP will get some heat, but in politics, it wont be remembered. "

26887847741,Correction: Many *Democrats* think breaching the debt ceiling is no big deal.
26887849876,"If the value of the dollar plummets, wouldnt that increase the price of US traded stocks (being priced in dollars)? Not saying this is good in any way, just trying to understand the effect."
26887857617,The fed would hold interest rates down. There would be virtually no change in interest rates.
26887865673,"In other words, the same thing that will happen eventually if we *keep raising* the debt cieling over and over again."
26887868300,"Hitting the debt ceiling wouldnt be a good thing, and repeat offender hostage taker Republicans shouldnt be rewarded, but seriously people, get a grip. Lets unpack these claims. * Credit markets could freeze. Yes, and a comet could hit D.C. (we should be so lucky) Lots of things *could* happen but are unlikely. Anyone care to present a plausible argument for why they probably *will* freeze? * The value of the dollar could plummet. Again, we should be so lucky. The dollar has fallen somewhat against, say, the Chinese yuan, but theres still room to go. A cheaper dollar would reduce our trade deficit and boost the economy. Whenever someone says something like, We need the Chinese to stop manipulating their currency, what do you think they mean? They *mean* for the dollar to fall. * U.S. interest rates could skyrocket. Again, could. But will they? Short-term rates are nearly 0% right now. [Here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/08/whats-happening-in-the-treasury-bill-market-today-should-terrify-you/?tid=pm_business_pop) is another scary Post article just in time for Halloween. Gaze upon the scary graph with its skyrocketing interest rates and be terrified...until you notice the scale of the graph. Skyrocketing from ~0% all the way to...0.29% *Yawn*. * There might be a financial crisis... Then again, there might not be. * ...and [a] recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse Enough with the weasel word could. Please, the recession and downturn after 2008 wasnt caused by the financial crisis. It was caused by the collapse of the housing bubble, *which has already collapsed.* Terrible reporting, but then The Post isnt much of a serious newspaper."
26887870714,"Serious question time: Is breaching the debt ceiling a big deal for *most people*? If the media are to be trusted, and thats a very VERY shaky if, it would seem that most people in the US have shit credit, shit jobs, etc, etc. If the dollar plummets, that reduces the purchasing power of people that dont really have much purchasing power in the first place, due to shitty credit and low wages. Is that such a big deal? If the economy goes to shit, people will still be working low-wage jobs and barely be able to scrape by. Doesnt sound much different than the present situation. Are the people that are going to take the biggest hit at the top of the pyramid? Is that really a problem? "

26887921623,Im expecting the worst to happen here in the US.
26887933272,"Im with the republicans on this one: the debt has to be defaulted on and, if at all possible, the worst choice has to be made for how to handle the ensuing fiasco. This would have a lot of beneficiary effects: - the US will be dropped as the world reserve currency by all the countries who decide theyve just about put up with enough American bullshit for the next 5,000 years - US military adventures would become at once too expensive to be continued - reduced economic activity would drastically reduce pollution output"

The House Majority, the Republican leadership are mentally ill--and we are paying the price."

Its like someone telling your daughter they have to perform an exorcism on her vagina with their penis to save her."
26888243273,"There is a conceivable mechanism by which a shutdown might not have an adverse effect on the credit rating for a while. Were the Federal Government to prioritize debt repayment in lieu of transfer payments and the like would demonstrate that, more than anything, the U.S. will make sure to repay its debt. However, this probably wont be the case because it would mean millions of people who rely on things like social security would be left high and dry - and these people vote in large numbers. Any way you slice it, not raising the debt ceiling would be calamitous."

26888287604,"Part of me really wants to see this happen. The US defaulting on its obligations I mean. Not because it could lead to a massive economic collapse, not because it could mean the end of the US Dollar as a world currency, not because it would make a few rich assholes betting on it richer than God. But because I think the political aftermath would be hilariously entertaining. Republicans (tea-baggers and regular) all saying *no-one told us this would happen*, its not our fault*, *this is your fault for not allowing us to ruin Obamacare* etc. And politicians wouldnt be the only entraining part of it - itd be fun to see what all the journalists would have to say. Im going to bet 10 dollars (10 dollar value **after** the crash) that all of them are going to wash their hands of it - a mix of *told ya* and *its not our fault for giving these fuckwads enough airtime to make them believe their own bullshit*."

I do fear they are simply pushing to implement martial law and these are tests to see when were apathetic enough."
26888631404,Not raising the debt ceiling does not imply a default. Theres so much waste in government that we could easily scrape together enough cash to cover debt interest.

I argue as a conservative whos sick of being misled by other conservatives. If its an actual issue, I show people what the rational conservative view should be. Case in point: climate change. I am constantly using actual science to refute pure nonsense, and when I get called a big government liberal, I remind conservatives that the free market capitalist position is that government should not be spending billions of dollars subsidizing fossil fuels, and the fact that they are getting harder to find proves our CO2 output will end up coming down as the price of fossil fuels goes up and demand for alternatives grow in the market. Its as if nobody ever even thought of it, yet they are proponents of free market capitalism (while voting for republicans who give out more welfare to corporations than anyone else.) I agree with some of the sentiment that you really cannot win with them, but you shouldnt stop trying. You should always bring facts, no matter what position youre arguing from.

Note that the first three subsections only allow the transfer to US soil for prosecution, and even then, there are conditions. The biggest problem in this early version of the NDAA was that it only allowed a prisoner to be released to his own country, very few of whom want the guys back. Congress later added language pertaining to the transfer prisoners to alternate countries, but added a condition that the receiving country would have to insure that they wouldnt be harmed. Recently, some of the restrictions have been lessened with Yemen, where most of the detainees are from, allowing for some transfers to occur, the first in a year, and the president has created a DoD position to oversee transfers. If he were to just order the place closed and move the prisoners there to say, Fort Leavenworth, he would have to explain where he got the funds to do so and when he said, I dunno, he could be charged with misappropriation of funds. He hasnt vetoed the bills because they are in the NDAA, the entire military budget for the year. He threatens every year, but congress knows hes not going to defund the military, from fueling tanks to caring for vets, over Guantanamo detainees. And even if he did, the bill passes with huge margins every year and the veto would be over ruled instantly.

What could work is to reach for the opposite sides *moderate and sensible* voters and agree to work on what you agree on: your constitution, your rights and the need to restore accountability. Agree that your usual Democrat-Republican disputes over abortion, taxes and even weapons are worth putting aside until you get those things you agree upon back; the time to save what you both agree upon and are both losing right now. Those disputes will still be available for you all to fight over after you got back those basic things your founding fathers thought as essential and absolutely non-compromisable. We non-American often resent you for the one in your ranks belittling us and so often crossing the line between confidence and arrogance, but generally we like you and love your *original* spirit. Remember the massive feels you people got from the rest of the world on 9/11? Since then, we miss those feels probably more than most of you actually do. We want those back and the real you with them. No doubt well do when you people fix what a minority of you broke for the rest of you, and us. Obama promised you much and didnt deliver much, but dont let that beat you into defeat and acceptation. This guy sure seemed like the perfect storm for getting back on track and heal, but his failure doesnt mean theres not a real way of provoking a resurrection. The only possibility of America failing to get itself back is probably a post-Obama submission to an hope-is-bullshit sentiment. Hope isnt bullshit; trying the same things again and again is bullshit; falling for the same things again and again is bullshit; waiting for the right politician is bullshit. Money and political interests found how to get things done. Emulate and beat them at their own games. Politicians are for hire talents? Hire them and shove them your agenda in their throat. Reward them better and more than money and political interests. A government of the people by the people for the people will *never* make a comeback until the people get the best at this ugly game. Matters are too urgent for the luxury of trying to win it all while keeping your feet on the higher moral ground. Cut it. Embrace the darkside of the power game; choke those fuckers off from behind; win the game and get at its top; now youre there, change the rules while you can, so next matches of this game can be honest and moral; wash off from the darkside, but be ready to get it back if your country and constitution ever need dark knights again. **GET MAD**"

26760478013,"When you hear people say things like, I voted for him *because he was the lesser of two evils*, you have a broken system. Period. "
26759810364,Classic Rawstory post: Progressives shocked SHOCKED to learn that centerist president is ruling from the center.
26760177082,"Speaking of doing 180s. I find it amazing all the same people who championed the Patriot Act are suddenly, essentially against it. I am sure it has nothing to do with Obama. I assume if Obama was also against it, would these people still act the same? Lets check the historical record.... nah-uh. Starting to feel the collective amnesia wash over me.. must resist... try... and stay lucid."
26760486455,"Im not American but when I traveled to Italy a couple of years ago, some waiter in a restaurant says to me Yes we can! after he took my order. Seemingly he thought that I was American just because I spoke English and was a little overweight. "
26759721147,I would be more surprised if had been able to KEEP all his promises.
26759851706,My big fear of this is that come election time everyone is going to vote republican thinking they are making a difference. Then we get to watch everything get even worse as we keep descending.
26759976768,"Im sick of people pretending people didnt know this was happening in 2008. We knew in 2006, and people still voted for him, myself included. I have a hard time being outraged now when I knew then. I still think he was the right choice. "
26760373967,Really?
26759798976,"I remember the day in 2008 when we went out to McDs after the election, everyone in a giddy mood and my pals and strangers repeating the slogan together: Yes we can! Yes we can! We felt inspiration at the time, but looking back I get goosebumps to think how easily we were indoctrinated."
26759907265,"Yes, no one could have predicted that a politician would behave like a politician."
26760144452,"I like to think that in 30+ years Obama will write a memoir in which he will describe clearly how his ideals were undermined by the overwhelming tide of programs already in place that he had to maintain. At the same time, I do think that he has lost sight/lost touch with his main constituency, those of us who thought it was possible to have an elected leader who really was strong enough to fight through all of the built in shit and make policy based on what we (his constituency) really think is important."
26759764043,I imagined both him becoming president and him continuing bushs policies. I knew this would happen because no meaningful changes in foreign policy have happened in my lifetime regardless of who has been in charge.
26759832649,This is exactly what I expected from Obama. He hasnt been worse than I thought. Hes been better than I thought. But then I know what Im getting with establishment politicians.
26760034510,"Is it possible that Obama has learned, as president, certain facts that might have led him to make the decisions he has?"
26759762772,Im pretty sure Mike Gravel called Obama out on his bullshit during the debate. Pretty much knew he would be a smarter version of Bush.
26760249819,Bullshit
26759756498,"republicans started saying, less than two years after the election, that we had been duped and that obama was not what we thought. but one thing they didnt mean by that was: that he would make republicans dreams come true."
26759808095,"Ha, I do find these articles amusing. Anyone could see who this man was in 2007... they chose not to."
26760182746,"Great so the democrat thats in power sucks now so we can have a republican in power later that we will in turn also find out sucks and then well go back and forth. Its like 1984 where we just pretend like we are at war with this place all the time and then we change sides. Fuck this shit. Also, voting for caricatures of existing parties is a worse idea so dont tell me about libertarians or the Green Party."
26759769435,if you think oboma suddenly morphed into a politicly different person then you dont know how chicago style politics work.same in 2013 as he was in 2004.
26759725286,Im struck by the relative speed of his reversals. He came over to the side of big brother in weeks if not days after assuming office. Meanwhile his switch to gay marriage champion took years.
26760042721,He didnt change. He was simply unknown. You couldnt have pointed to anything he had done for reference. Its very strange to think about how we took an obscure junior senator who had not served a single term and gave him the keys to the castle. This post brings up a scary point. Rewind the clock just 6 years and nobody new who thos guy was. But slews of propagandists got us. They pumped out inspiring art and slogans that had no substance. It will go down as one of the greatest mass brainwashing events ever. For god sake they gave him the peace prize before he did anything.
26759807713,"Literally the -first- thing I said as soon as I heard he was going to be a presidential candidate was I bet everyone is going to actually believe his promises because he looks different, and I guarantee hell win two terms. But what do I know, Im just a crazy conservative. "
26759720429,"Its called adjusting to reality. It seems crazy to you because for most of you, this is the first election you were old enough to vote in. Older redditors have seen this phenomenon of aiming for the stars and then the resulting compromise with reality played out dozens of times. Its nothing new, and it does not mean that Obama is suddenly a corporate/facist/nazi shill, and that he was a complete angel before. Reality is never that simple."
26759962734,Amazing how Americans have dramatically transformed into crybaby bitches less than a decade later.
26760369662,in my mind there is a corporation pointing a gun at him at all times somewhere off camera. 
26760049270,"I feel as though we deserve much of the blame for the lack of progress on these issues. When we chanted Yes we can!, it seems like everyone was *really* saying Yes *he* can!. Its as if we expect the system to change itself. But if you pay attention to Obamas speeches, it was always about what we collectively can accomplish, which makes a lot of sense considering the man was a community organizer for so long. I just dont see any pressure on the man to act, but give him credit: when there has been, hes listened. On healthcare, on gun control, and on foreign policy. If there was as much pressure to prosecute crooked bankers as there was to end the war in Iraq. This is on us. Make no mistake about it. If we want Change, we the people need to actually make it happen. Obama himself said as much, before and after his election (and re-election)."
26759795198,"I dont think there was transformation, its just election-campaigning-persona and then in-power-persona. Edit: But I have to say, I had more hope in him than any of the previous presidents."
26760457840,No one could have imagined...anyone with a fucking brain could have. He is a politician.
26759641202,So why do you think hes changed? What does he now know that changed his opinion regarding privacy so drastically? 
26759762014,Yawn
26759762827,And what was the alternative? Take a gamble on President Palin?
26759763709,"I want to read this, but that on swipe thing keeps popping up. Edit: Im on my iPad."
26759775017,i dont see any evidence that Obama has morphed into a Richard Nixon. He might be boxed in by some ugly political realities but he seems pretty consistent.
26759781068,"Im really tired of naive, utopian Redditors and their unenlightened critiques of the supposedly-corrupted Obama. People in my generation (Im 22) need to read some books about the national security apparatus and the transition from Bush to Obama. Obama knew very little about national security threats when he campaigned for the presidency, but that changed when he started getting his daily briefings. True, he made some serious about-faces, but thats when happens when mostly-uninformed idealism (a.k.a. a good portion of this subreddit) meets cold, hard reality. I am not an Obama apologist, but I think its important to recognize the challenge he faces even if we dont excuse every action that results from it. He is trying to square his constitutional-law background and deep animosity toward Bush-era secrecy with the reality of governing a complicated and frequently-targeted country in an age where the enemy doesnt wear a uniform or have a defense ministry."
26759781214,"Fuckers. Its all a big fucking game. Why is it so hard to believe the rich control the world? Why, why, why? MONEY and POWER."
26759785095,The better option isnt necessarily a good one. 
26759814507,"I knew. I watched that speech at the democratic convention, live. And I said that night that he was full of crap and that he would very likely be president. It was scary, because he said all the right things and with the cadence of a minister."
26759820696,"Here is a news flash most redditors and Americans in general do not want to here. Most people complaining dont even pay attention to national politics, dont pay attention to what their congressmen are doing. What do you think is going to happen the government going to work efficiently and in our best interest just because they care. If you want to change you dont vote out a President you replace a majority of the congress, because that is where the one place the people have the most voice. When your society can tell you the names of the Kardashians, name all of Brad Pitts children, yet dont even know the names of their congressmen, or even take the time to see what major policy decisions are being done. Well democracy has failed, and the top 1% will continue to use divide and conquer to get what they want since most Americans are stupid and lazy to care. "
26759824544,"Id like to think everyone around him in our corrupt government forced him to change. Id like to think he got into office and things were a completely different world than he thought, and he couldnt live up to all of his promises because of it."
26759829949,"About time to put on my Dont blame me, I voted for gary Johnson! bumper sticker "
26759830673,Worse than Bush 
26759832820,"I did, and its naive to believe otherwise."
26759847665,"While the rest of us intelligent humans saw right through his fucking facade. Dont you feel so fucking stupid for voting for him now? If the answer is no, you were deprived of the short bus growing up. "
26759864938,Ron Paul warned us about it.
26759879491,Oh dear.
26759880722,"Obama always reminded me of Michael Corleone. Young, idealistic, inspiring, way more competent than all the idiots around him. But once he gets involved, he figures out that the reason why people make the choices they do isnt just because theyre idiots, its the logic of the system that they live in. If he wants to be the best (and goddamnit, he does), hes going to be the best within that system. Yes, always, he says that hes going to change everything, but somehow the changes just seem to entrench the system even further."
26759882559,"Bullshit. Myself and half my friends called this during the first campaign. Circle jerk aside I am not a racist, a redneck, well off, hardcore republican or any other of many things. I just dont fall for some ultra liberal past based politician claiming he will do anything other than the big government crap his predecessor was hated for. "
26759883650,"I think its hilarious all the Obama supporters talking down to everyone with smug self satisfaction, look at you now. RON PAUL all the way!"
26759890660,Where can I sign the Impeach vote?
26759893062,Would it make sense to impeach him? Blows my mind Clinton got impeached for a bj and whats Obama get for this?
26759897221,[deleted]
26759899273,"As I have stated in other posts, no president will ever have the power to do what they promised. No president ever. Presidents are controlled by the wealthy to advance their agendas. The politicians are just a facade to keep us thinking that we have a voice in our governance, but we dont. Presidents make $400,000 a year. Compare that to the millions of dollars that CEOs make. Now think what you can do with millions of dollars. You can hire plenty of skilled hitmen that can murder ANYONE regardless of what protection they have. That is the power that money gives them. Politicians know this, and thats why they accept to help the corrupt wealthy people instead of opposing them. The few politicians that do say no to these people are very little threat, and hence do not get murdered. Money rules the world. Either reject it or be ruled by it."
26759904732,"My hand was up and waving, but I was called a racist and was ostracized. Sooooooo I shut up, and I was able to keep my job. "
26759904928,Looool. This is all I have to say.
26759922362,"Better late than never. Maybe in another ten years hell actually support, maybe, kinda, not voting for a Democrat or a Republican. Maybe in ten years hell realized we shouldve impeached him."
26759944631,Id like to find out what exactly happened between 2004 and 2013 to Barack Obama. What caused him to Change?
26759951472,":YAWN: Only dipshits that have no idea how the *real world* works thought that Obama would end the wars immediate, push through universal coverage, instantly close down Gitmo, and kill the Patriot Act. Anyone with a brain knows that that is not how politics works. You need bi-partisan support for most things (remember who holds the purse strings?), and the GOP has been more against *anything* this President has wanted than any other President in history. There are also potentially big reasons why something like the Patriot Act is still around - seems like the very same people that are now feigning outrage (even though the PA has been around for some *12 years* now), would also be the very first people asking where was the gobment? if some big terrorist event actually happened. Yeah, sorry folks, but when the general public wasts the White Houses time by proposing we fund a Death Star (a la Star Wars), then you guys kind of prove that you cant take matters seriously. Oh yeah, and keep on posting every detail of your life on FaceBook, but then pretend that the gobment knowing things about it is somehow out of line. In a country that has been moving to the right for 30+ years now, and a President who has had his hands tied by a worthless Congress, Obama has gotten a shit ton of stuff accomplished, so sorry if I dont jump on the weekly Hater-ade train. "
26759952528,Hen was like this from the start when he rigged his election to be Ill. state senator.
26759962982,"Yes they could, and did."
26759970194,"I wouldnt have expected it then, but I knew in the primary that he voted against habeus corpus, voted to renew the Patriot Act, voted for a bill that would allow war with Iran, etc. I never expected he would be *worse* than Bush when it came to these things, but I did at least expect he would be as bad. You all should have done your research and seen it coming at least a little more."
26759976476,Power corrupts. Not big surprise. People were fooled yet again. Also not big Surprise.
26759985108,Sure they did. Most intelligent people that have voted in more than one election know that any major party nominee is always corrupt
26759989760,"Id laugh at how easily you pathetic twits were conned by this piece of shit, except that you will be just as easily conned by the next charismatic lying sack of shit. Fucking idiots."
26760024754,Its funny that the demos couldnt see what the republicans could but what did the republicans offer? A rock could have run against a demo in 2008 and won. Sheeple. 
26760026713,I could. Hes a fucking politician. 
26760027991,"I always remember that speech with disgust - both for Obama and the Democratic rank-and-file generally. He articulated a philosophy of compromise even back then, and clueless dems lapped it up. No one spoke about the real problem: the right wing had gone crazy. Of the senior Democratic leadership, Al Gore was the only one who got close to identifying real problems and real solutions. And now, we can look forward to 2016 when these idiots will nominate Hillary."
26760040906,"OOh fucking Waahh. Actually, people DID imagine this. And sadly for you Redditors, one of them was [Alex Jones.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaQNACwaLw) (I know how much we hate him. Downvote all you want, but at least watch and think for yourself.)"
26760063782,"Republicans cant just keep flaunting their tactics as reason to blame their opponents, thats gay."
26760118805,So why did so many people still buy what this liar was selling in 2012?

26760128940,"I was a fanatical Obama supporter in 2008, thinking he was the reincarnation of FDR. His whole presidency has been one huge let-down after another. It seems like somewhere between 2004 and 2008 he sold his soul to Wall Street. I have become convinced that change through the ballot box is impossible. Even well-meaning reformers like Obama become corrupted by the system. Only a grass-roots social revolution based on direct action against the 1% will change anything. National strikes, 100,000+ marches of armed armed protestors in Washington DC and in state capitals and corporate HQs, Alternative communities, direct worker takeover of their workplaces, etc."
26760134537,No one? Oh you mean how Clinton turned from liberal to NAFTA supporting conservative? Yes... nobody...
26760145232,"I expect to get down-voted for this, but fuck it. I voted for Barack Obama because I liked what I heard from him about foreign policy, the environment, and healthcare. I never once expected him to change the Bush administrations policies on intelligence gathering (he voted for FISA). So far he has delivered on what I expected. I knew I wasnt voting for a liberal, I wanted a moderate after 8 years of Bush Administration bullying. Im glad my Presidents a moderate, and while I didnt, and still dont agree with some of his policies, I got what I voted for and am patient enough to know that it doesnt end with his administration."
26760156155,"Uninformed voters winged it, and this is what we ended up with. "
26760160985,"As an American I hereby pledge that I will only consider a candidates qualifications, plan and leadership ability while ignoring race, gender or sexual orientation. We elected a black guy to feel good about ourselves, now we pay the piper. Affirmative action got Obama into Columbia and Harvard and left us with an unqualified president. No mas. "
26760215622,I must be the only person who cant read the fucking article! What the fuck
26760216512,Obama to Reagan look at how they bent to their training. 
26760220516,"A far better man than Bill Clinton yet we are not giving him the support we gave zipper man... WE know the attacks began before he took office, every day attack, attack, attack. You must be made to hate the man you elected. You MUST NOT make noise and support him. . . . . I am so sad at how thoughtful intelligent people do not understand that the elected voice has not been heard since 1980. And will not as long as we allow it. "
26760231940,Vote Libertarian.
26760248297,"Yeah, because Jounalism is a very trusted profession these days too.. everyone is full of shit and this article sounds like someone trying to cash in on the I was right the whole time card when its bullshit to play that card too. NSA Scandel are you kidding me? Sit the fuck down you overblown idiot. Stop trying to stir the shit with a stick and maybe try to offer a solution instead of some whimsical fuckwit message about how you were right and oh my god we thought this guy was going to save the world even though some people are doing nothing but throwing every road block in the way to stop progress of any sort. The sad part is how a good amount of the comments below are just a big circle jerk - a patriotic circle jerk in where the black man was wrong the whole time. This website is now the generic public opinion site, no longer home to the outside of the box thinkers. Only here to be another news outlet or another way of dumping in cash to help promote some elses agenda. Game over man, game over. "
26760254142,Obama is as bad as Dick darth vader Cheney.
26760275022,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/
26760278924,Except for every republican ever. I love how they were called racist for not liking Obama. Liberals looking like a bunch of idiots. You cant say shit to anyone who voted for Bush. 
26760279132,"LOL - So glad I voted for Gary Johnson on the Libertarian ticket and have voted 3rd party way back since Bush 1 at every level of government when possible and when its not possible I make sure to vote against long standing incumbents. Anyways I feel my vote was a principled vote based on my own views of economic and social liberties espoused by Gary and guys like Ron Paul and their logical and common sense view on desiring a much more limited and restrained federal government. It was a vote that now has made me feel oh so much better once I realize that I dont have to wash off or drink away the shame/stink of voting for a flat out two faced liar like Obama (or what Romney would of been if elected). This new Obama scandal and those that have preceded it just keep on justifying this view over and over again. Call it smugness, call it whatever you want but at the end of the day I know I made the right decision compared to the majority of the US population who votes lock step like drones/lemmings for both parties who continually sell them out everytime they get a chance to do so. All because these folks have been caught up in the fear-mongering populist cheerleading bullshit espoused by the two big parties."
26760283638,"As the Greeks understood, you cannot put Agape (Love) before Logos (Reason). Love only grows *out* of Reason. This has always been the fatal mistake of the left, and it is a deadly reversal of the true Dialectec. What was the last of the horrors in Pandoras Box? Hope. Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs mans torment. Friedrich Nietzsche BTW, you people truly are sheep and you deserve everything thats coming to you."
26760283744,and no one said the same thing about george w. bush? or maybe even nixon..?
26760293719,"Give me a break. What do people expect out of the post of Presidency? It is one man in a series of checks and balances that are imbalanced because of the two-party system (or rather, in a grid-lock). Just because you elect the progressive black man doesnt mean the whole system is going to benefit as a result. "
26760294853,No one . . Ahem . . 
26760297070,"That just shows how powerful the system is. Oh, you like this guy? Cool, watch what we do once we own him. "
26760327987,I voted for Obama in 2012. I will not vote Democrat again. I will not vote for anyone again. Obama has tainted politics forever for me.
26760342951,Obama supporters were convinced by a three word slogan. Now theyre upset and feel betrayed? They collectively have the IQ of a carrot.
26760352910,"All I see are people clamoring for change. Boo Bush sucked I want Obama, Boo Obama sucks, hes a traitor! Well guess what guys, we live in a democracy, not an autocracy. The President has a LIMITED amount of power. When Congress obstructs legilastion at historic highs, the President has even less power. The President cant magically make laws disappear. Politics is a dirty fucking game. You have to lie your way in, you have to act like youre the next Jesus and youre going to save the country. Now of course every President makes ridiculous promises that they cant keep. Our government has to go through many, many, MANY routes to initiate anything. Politics is like a maze and its really tough for things to get through efficiently. Its a constant war between Dem and Reb. "
26760356877,This article can be summed up in 3 words: Follow the money.
26760371754,I did.
26760374695,"No one in that hall in Boston in 2004 could have imagined that the young, eloquent and inspiring politician would have transformed so dramatically less than a decade later. Maybe no one in that hall had any ability to understand that to get elected you need to be someone that plays the game, and that playing the game means you need to behave yourself and do as your master tell you. Those of us who know that the President is not the one with the real power, that it is a combination of big business and big lobbies which really run the show, have known that Obama would be nothing like the person he pretended to be originally. THEY NEVER ARE."
26760374909,"And next up for auction the candidate from Illinois. Well start the bidding at $1,000,000. Do I hear $2,000,000? "
26760375357,as i mentioned before : the USA got the leader it deserves. Blame yourself not Obama - he hasnt changed a bit.

26760390072,Dont overgeneralize. I saw through all his lies and evil lurking inside. Not everyone is that blind
26760437618,See that political party hes tied to? Itsa big sign screaming Im not any different. People actually believe theres some huge difference between the parties. They only vary slightly by the rights they want to take away. If you keep believing in the same system that got us here then youre part of the problem.
26760519341,From the great black hope to the great black dope. How this dude was re-elected blows-my-fucking-mind.
26760521292,total. bullshit. reddit is truly clueless.
26760533691,"1. The laws and policies of the United States are built on precedent. The system is purposely designed so that it is very hard to make any changes at all, impossible for radical change. 2.The unofficial structure of the government, including the two party system, is run by private self-interested money, their tireless lobbyist, single focused Generals and the good ol boy network including people who influence what passes for information, fact and public opinion. 3.The number 1 duty of a President is the responsibility for maintaining the security of the American people. You cannot fail to take every effort to that because any lapse opens you up to a failed administration and the loss of the office for your party. 4.The President and his administration are sworn to enforce the law, whatever the law the Congress makes. People who are vastly disappointed in Obama were just very naive about the real power of the Presidency; especially coming off 8 years of paranoia induced policy and with an intentionally obstructive Congress. He is not a dictator, he does not make law, he has no jawboning sway over Congressmen who assure their local election by opposing him on every issue. I still trust Mr. Obama to make the best choices he can within the context of what he can choose."

26760634020,He didnt transform. HES A CHICAGO POLITICIAN. I saw right through his bullshit in 08 and tried to warn everyone. But you all fell for it like sheeple. There will NEVER be a real legitimate president for the people ever again. Any candidate who has a real shot and says he is is a bold faced liar.
26760635030,My President got Universal healthcare passed and hundreds of other things I like. Most of this with an opposition party whos stated goal was to make the President fail even if it hurt the country. Whomever had a messiah complex for the President was unrealistic but things are much better than if he had lost either of his elections. Which is the real alternative people dont seem to talk about.

26763411004,"It just reaffirms my belief that it is the system thats broken, not the people. I have no doubt that Obama believed in his message and that he believed that once elected he could effect change. And I dont think its just Obama who was so hopeful. Im going to go out on a limb and say that most people who decide to make the jump into politics have that same hopefulness and belief right up until they are elected. And then they get swallowed up by the machine. Corporations and special interests (read: money) have a stranglehold on politics. I dont know how to fix the system but it seems to me that campaign finance reform is the place to start. Not sure how to handle the primary election campaign finance, but I would love it if each candidate in a general election received an equal amount of public funds and let the chips fall where they may. And I would cap it at one million per candidate. Simplistic? Indeed. Unrealistic? For sure. But what the hell? One can dream, cant one?"
26934678043,"From the methodology, it looks like they took the 5 cheapest pre-ACA rates and compared them to the 5 cheapest post-ACA rates. A bit of a glitch in this is that the cheapest rates pre-ACA are the ones getting canceled for non-compliance, since they didnt cover enough. To be fair, in the cite of the cite they adjusted for people who couldnt get coverage pre-ACA by assuming the plans would cost 3 times as much.

26803728053,"&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, tweeted a startling statistic to his followers on July 22, 2012: Today the Walton family of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/31/bernie-s/sanders-says-walmart-heirs-own-more-wealth-bottom-/"
26803616220,"You do realize that this works out to a bit over $5.00 per share, right? You know that profits dont go into a bank account dont you? They are a reflection only of increased share price, unless there is a dividend distributed to share holders. Walmart is capitalized at 3.28 billion share, currently priced at $77.80 a share. So if you had purchased 100 shares at todays prices, it would cost you $7780.00, not bad, an expense of almost $8000 earning a bit over 6% in a year, to earn YOU $500. You are welcome to do the math yourself, here is the link. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=WMT You are welcome to purchase as many as you choose, so YOU TOO can become a wealthy capitalist and RISK your money on your knowledge and willingness to make a profit, or maybe a loss. "
26803766289,"The Waltons own a lot of shares. 51.17%. If they held less than 50% then they would not control the store. Despite what Sanders tweets, how is it going to help you by forcing the Waltons to Share their wealth? Keep in mind that this wealth is USED, not just sat on. This is an accumulation of two generations. Do you honestly think that there should be a maximum amount of money that any family should be allowed to earn? "
26968615600,"The entire point of public policy is to create a better society by dissecting and predicting how households/ firms will REACT to changes in the law. By your logic, if the government were to place a 100% tax on a corporation, it would be the corporations fault for closing. By your logic, the policymaker takes no blame for the failures of the War on Drugs. By your logic, the policymaker takes no blame for the housing bubble."
26968798546,"If you click the other link on the page you will find this: &gt;As we have previously noted, many Americans already lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law. Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan. &gt;How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population switched health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching... So, accepting Politifacts numbers, 4 million out of 250 million people lost their insurance by insurers who claim the ACA was the cause. Thats 1.6% of insured people. If you make a statement, that at one time both Obama and [Politifact believed to be true](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/barack-obama/obamas-plan-expands-existing-system/)... Can a statement that is: * believed to be true * and actually turns out to be true for 98.4% of people * and is dependent on a decision at least partially controlled insurers * and its not unusual for 14+% of people to lose their insurance in any given year can this really be the lie of the year? Sounds like hyperbole to me."
26968849300,"Im sorry... but what planet are you from? Certainly not this one. If the government mandates that plans must cover A, B, and C... then logically, plans that dont meet those requirements would have to be canceled. But what about grandfathering you might ask? &gt;But the Department of Health and Human Services then wrote regulations that narrowed that provision, by saying that if any part of a policy was significantly changed since that date -- the deductible, co-pay, or benefits, for example -- the policy would not be grandfathered. [Especially in light of two-three week old revelations that the Administration knew it was lying when it promised that everyone that liked their health care could keep it.](http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/28/21213547-obama-admin-knew-millions-could-not-keep-their-health-insurance)"
26968533938,"I wonder if people complained about their doctor retiring as being evidence against if you like your doctor you can keep seeing your doctor? Did they expect Obama to nationalize insurance? That would have been nice, but its the only way to force someone into still selling a service. Clearly he was referring to that the law wouldnt cancel existing plans. The law obviously didnt force companies to keep selling those plans. "
26968916472,"Ahhhh those insurance policies were illegal under Obamacare, thats why they were cancelled. It wouldve been illegal to keep those policies in place. "
26968649626,"Ah, so we use politifact to our advantage when it makes a republican look bad but simply say youre wrong when it paints Obama as your typical politics? Sweet, sweet /r/politics. I think they took this place from the frontpage because of all the enlightenment."
26968984436,Thats false.
26969075157,"Its true, but he shouldve noted it instead of repeating you will get to keep your current plan over and over."
26969127730,"Yeah, As much as I fucking hate the circle jerk in /r/politics, this time I read the article and was kind of surprised. How can that be lie of the year? First of all from the specific wording you can keep it. is objectively true. You could keep your policy. But if you take the meaning to be It is entirely your choice to keep it or not. Then yes you could say that is false. However being objective I would put that as sort of false, because I think the phrase you can implies it is a personal elective. However the truth is that it requires both you and your insurance companies compliance. The you can is certainly not true but lie of the year? No. Especially since the healthcare debate happened mostly in 2009, and I feel like something more relevant to 2013 would be were not spying on innocent american citizens."
26969073908,"Anybody who looked closely at ACA knew that the statement was false. He promised something he simply had no way to guarantee. And its always been that way - this is not something thats new under ACA. I hope the law works (as a first step towards a much simpler, better solution), and Ive voted for Obama twice and wouldnt change those votes, but this was a biggie that never should have been uttered. Although, since he hasnt said it since 2009 Im not sure why its the 2013 LOTY. But it is the most notorious lie thats been newsworthy this year. "
26968719162,"No Obama did not lie, because its just absurd that anyone thought Obama was guaranteeing he was going to force private corporations they could never cancel their insurance plans. Neither Obama nor the GOP foresaw that companies were going to gleefully cancel plans they didnt have to. Because (1) if the GOP had foreseen this they would have made it a central issue from the start, and (2) its not like Obama had some sort of secret privileged information the GOP didnt have or the average person didnt have."
26969149651,You are absurdly ignorant if you think the new laws have nothing to do with insurance companies changing or canceling their plans.
26969029141,Shill
26968446332,"So Politifact notes that nothing in the new law prevents insurance companies from offering the same old plans indefinitely - that it was entirely their choice to cancel any plans they cancelled - and then calls Obamas statement a lie, as if he, and not insurers, was in any way responsible for the cancellation of plans. Okay."
26969848557,The way I understood it they couldnt change the plan in any way what so ever and since each year plans are tweaked and changed it would invalidate it from being grandfathered in. These changes happen every year but most are fairly minor and doesnt affect the scope of the plan itself. Thats how plans work and if you accept that these changes are a part of your plan then yes its a lie because you arent unable to keep your plan.
26968976785,"The statement is still false. You can justify it however you like, but politifact can only remain neutral by objectively stating whether or not a statement is true. Obama said that the healthcare bill would not interfere with peoples choice to keep their old plan if they wanted to, and that wasnt true. He didnt qualify his statement with unless your insurance company changes the plans they offer in response to the healthcare overhaul. Neglecting to mention that insurance companies would likely modify the plans they offer in response to such a significant restructuring of our healthcare system is something that the Obama administration should be held accountable for. Surely this was not a surprise for them; how do they expect insurance companies to modify their practices to transition to a new healthcare system without changing some of the plans they offer? But Ill bet it *was* a surprise for many average Americans who have minimal knowledge about either Obamacare or the healthcare industry in general. If a conservative had said something this misleading, reddit would be unanimous in its condemnation. Blaming insurance companies for adapting to a new system in a very predictable manner is ridiculous."
26968796703,"I promise the government is not going to take your car away {someone steals your car} Internet commenter: Its a lie because Obama had no power to grant it. He couldnt promise no one would steal your car, so it was a lie to do so Me: {facepalm} "
26968587045,"Because the law was set-up such that it was *inevitable* and entirely predictable that this would occur. Youre right that, in theory it was possible to keep the plans going. But the completely expected outcome of the set of regulations would be that most of these policies would go away. So, if youd like to say it was the insurance companies choice, I have no problem with that. But, by the same token, either Obama was naive/stupid or lying for telling the American people only one specific potential outcome that could have resulted. Again, this was largely predictable."
26968535527,"Oh cmon, you know that people dont care about facts?!? Death panels, socialism and birth certificates are the rage man!"
26968924685,"The president didnt sell the law as We will not force companies to cancel your plan if you like it. -- he sold it as if you like your plan you can keep it. period. You note that theres nothing in the law that prevents insurance companies from offering the same old plans (though politifact seems to disagree with that given the strict grandfathering rules), but theres nothing in the law that forces insurance companies to continue the policies either. Absent a mandate for continued coverage and/or a provision where the government would service cancelled contracts, its deceitful (at best) to guarantee everyone would be able to keep their plan if they liked it."
26968784873,"Its a lie namely because Obama had no power to grant it. If I promised that Bill Gates was going to give you a billion dollar or your employer isnt going to fire you I would be lying. It was a lie, it was a blatant lie, and the only problem with Politifact calling this out is they didnt do it sooner. Like after the 37 times he said it. I suppose one could argue that Obama didnt intend to for it to be taken literally, but wanted people to hear it as If you like your plan Obamacare wont make you give it up, but insurers can still be asshats. However, I say you should be freaking accurate when you talk. You arent George W Bush. You can speak English well Mr. President. "
26969136385,"When you say something simple, it should have simple implications. If youd bought insurance in the last two years, the implications are not at all simple. Its a devil-in-the-details thing, and we nailed Romney and Ryan on that sort of lie by omission during their campaign a kajillion times. It was said to reassure when the actual outcome for millions deserved representation. I dun even care whether ends justify the means here when were talking about whether a person lied by omission."
26968662828,"The law made it financially impossible for insurance companies to keep offering all of the same plans, so yeah I would consider it a lie. What about the inexpensive plans that offered minimum coverage? Those are gone now since they are deemed insufficient by the ACA."
27116620434,"And the electoral vote, if honestly counted."

And you could spin this all you want, the poorest in the U.S. are worse off than the poorest in India, because no one loans money to the poorest in India.

26993899108,"What calculator are you using mate? Obama has created more than half of the current national debt and has a budget that never balances. Ever. How on earth can you lump the entire US healthcare system onto the government books, collect no more tax revenue, balance the budget AND pay back $17 trillion in debt with 18 years? Youre fucking dreaming mate."
26993946135,"First off, Obama didnt create half of the current national debt. In terms of new spending, Obama has one of the best track records of any modern president. The vast majority of spending under the Obama administration is not new spending. Its carry over from existing policies from the previous administration. http://www.factcheck.org/2012/06/obamas-spending-inferno-or-not/ Created? No. Not at all. The vast majority of spending is from Republican programs. As for a single payer system, the math works out quite nicely. I didnt say we wouldnt collect more taxes. I said collect taxes as if we werent a single payer system, i.e. payments for private insurance are converted to taxes. Our current national health expenditures are $2.6 trillion. The cost of a single payer system is around $1.2 trillion a year. If we collect $2.6 trillion in taxes per year rather than $1.2 trillion the system actually costs (theres no change here in the amount of money an individual is spending...just changing it from pay to the private sector to pay into a single payer system), were left with a $1.4 trillion difference there. With the current deficit shrinking and down to $630 billion this year, if we implemented the system before the baby boomers start to really retire in 2016, we would have an immediate surplus that goes entirely to the debt. Debt costs shrink and at the same time, federal spending on interest on the debt shrinks. This lowers our annual spending. In around 18 years (give or take a few years), the debt would be paid off completely. Its just a fact that the government can provide health care coverage at a much cheaper price than the private sector. And thats the advantage of a single payer system. "
27000440922,"Read Krugman on SNAP (food stamps): http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/more-snap-judgments/ Read his whole post, not just the graph, and note he denominates by GDP. Yes, it is higher today, because were in a depressed economy. But the long-term trend thru 2008 was lower spending relative to earlier years. Calling out that these social safety net programs are at all time highs, during a time of extended economic depression, is really missing the forest for the trees. The spending is supposed to be high, it is designed to be that way, and if you buy into its at an all time high, when will it end without looking at the long term trends, then youre being misled. The number of unwed **teen** mothers today is actually much lower than it was in the past. True, the rate is high in the African American community, but the overall trend in the most at-risk group, the teen moms, has been going down for decades. https://www.russellsage.org/sites/all/files/Furstenberg_chap1_0.pdf See graph on page 9. That woman leaves her husband is an issue, but she often leaves for good reason. That doesnt mean the unwed child-bearing rate in African American women is not an issue, but keep in mind that when you see the statistic unwed moms theres a lot of those moms who left abusive situations, or men who have abandoned their accountabilities. Those mens economic status improves while the women and children suffer. Look at Pell grants. You can poo-poo that and say it is not a welfare program, but it is a high quality investment opportunity to fund college-level education. I was Pell grant eligible back in the day. Used to be that Pell grants could cover your tuition. Not any more: http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid/figures-tables/fed-aid-maximum-pell-grant-percentage-total-charges-over-time And this gets directly at your issue of supply and demand of labor. The very programs that would create a supply of higher quality labor have been cut, both at the federal level, and also at the state level, particularly in Red states. The withdrawal of state funding for college education over the past 20 years is abysmal. Who now funds the higher education of that single Black mom? Private, for-profit degree mills that fool her into thinking there is a job for her where she can repay the loan. Wait, lets hold those private for-profit degree mills accountable! You can see how everyone has rallied to Elizabeth Warrens battle flag on that one. The overall union wage difference is closer to 23% and that is before you factor in fringe benefits. Also, you just compared Boston to North Carolina. Is there some reason why you chose Boston rather than say Pittsfield, a working class community that is more comparable to say Greenville NC? Im talking apples to apples, compare like communities, dont pull Boston out of your ass unless you are willing to compare it to Washington DC. On top of that, union membership gives you job security -- it is an intangible, but it is real. You also get a much more predictable rate of pay increase, as well as defined training benefits. I also do account for union dues, as does the research on this matter. I was a union member at one time, by chance it saved me about $45,000 dollars by standing up for my health care coverage rights relative to faculty members at peer institutions who were not organized and whose administrators simply dropped that benefit because they were told they could do it -- the workers had collective bargaining rights, no contractual claim to those benefits. Look, its been a good exchange, youve been respectful and have granted that Ive made some good points. Ive been watching this unfold for decades while moving from the middle class to the upper class. I know how much I have benefited from federal programs, union protection, and low capital gains taxes and tax shelters along the way. Yes, supply and demand in the labor market is an important thing, but having basic food and shelter was not a problem for veterans returning from WWII -- we had a social safety net that gave them a house on campus (granted, often a shack, but they loved it) and enough money to attend college AND support a small family AND low cost business development loans. If you want to see when the social safety net was in its prime, look at how we cared for WWII veterans in the late 1940s thru the 1950s, and how the economy grew. Then look for something like that today."
27000392385,"I do plenty of volunteer work. What I think has changed is social make up. For example, there are far more single mothers today than in the past, mainly among African-Americans unfortunately: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/don-lemon/cnns-don-lemon-says-more-72-percent-african-americ/ Things like single-motherhood make it harder for families to make ends meet. It also leads to lower education results, and other things that drive the poverty cycle. If you could, please point to a Federal welfare program that gets less funding now than before. Food stamps, disability, etc... are at all time highs, in addition we just ended the longest extension of unemployment benefits in a long time. What about the American welfare state is smaller than before? And, granted that overall spending is larger, why was that program better than what we are spending money on now. Keep in mind that a growing population does not account for this growth in spending. We are looking at GDP percentages, NOT total real expenditures. In regards to the union problem, the wage difference is generally a low percentage. Something like 15% if I remember hearing on MSNBC That is less than enough to make up for difference in cost of living. As I found using this calculator, the difference between Boston and North Carolina is 20%: http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/ Also, fine, you made a good point with fringe benefits, but dont forget to subtract union dues as well. All told, the difference would be so small, that it would shave a few hairs off of the growing income gap if more workers were unionized. Again, my point was that it was a red herring. Something much bigger is going on, that being, a shift in the economy as a whole. Supply and demand in the labor market."
27000357841,"You may get a different result, but you have not documented that result. Getting at the wage premium for union members is far more complex, you have to take into account fringe benefit such as health care coverage and pension, where the cost does not vary by region. Also, regional differences in cost of living for where union members actually live and work are not as high as the union wage premium in general, so right out of the box all you can show is that the wage premium shrinks, but it doesnt go away. Finally, citing Nate is weak -- youre missing the point that the growth in the welfare state that is above the population growth is driven by health care costs. Social security is a stable cost line item and funded as we go. If you really think the safety net is better now than in the past then you have not done much volunteer work lately."

26966709851,There was also the public option.
26966014961,"You recall incorrectly. Thats what the Democratic shills were pretending. The reality is that Americans overwhelmingly wanted a public option 75+%, or single payer at 50+%. The Democrats did not want either. Period. They were one vote away from a supermajority (filibuster-proof), but couldnt somehow find that one vote in a special election in Massachusetts of all places. Yet somehow theyve managed to ditch the filibuster now that it comes time to appoint cronies to the judiciary. Meanwhile, Obama went in the back room to suck in lobbyist money from big pharma and undercut the bill. And the shills took to the internet to try to walk back the Obama hopeful. Eventually they blamed some of it on Joe Lieberman, as if one single guy stood up against the entire nation on this. It was the DEMOCRATS who fucked health care reform, and they did it for money. The Republicans just sat on their fat asses and laughed the whole time. The end result was a bill with a small number of helpful reforms and a huge amount of corporate handouts."

Ted Nugent: Ted was a young boy, appearing to be a hippie but quite opposite in fact, working hard and playing hard, playing rock and roll like a deviant. People would question my sanity, I played so much. So I got my notice to be in the draft. Do you think I was gonna lay down my guitar and go play army? Give me a break! I was busy doin it to it. I had a career Jack. If I was walkin around, hippying down, getting loaded and pickin my ass like your common curs, Id say Hey yeah, go in the army. Beats the poop out of scuffin around in the gutters. But I wasnt a gutter dog. I was a hard workin, motherfuckin rock and roll musician. I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and Id drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up. See, I approached the whole thing like, Ted Nugent, cool hard-workin dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces. Im gonna play their own game, and Im gonna destroy em. Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss. I was ill. And three or four days before, I started stayin awake. I was close to death, but I was in control. I was extremely antidrug as Ive always been, but I snorted some crystal methedrine. Talk about one wounded motherfucker. A guy put up four lines, and it was for all four of us, but I didnt know and Im vacuuming that poop right up. I was a walking, talking hunk of human poop. I was six-foot-three of sin. So the guys took me down to the physical, and my nerves, my emotions were distraught. I was not a good person. I was wounded. But as painful and nauseous as it was -- cause I was really into bein clean and on the ball -- I made gutter swine hippies look like football players. I was deviano. So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldnt believe the smell. They were ridiculin me and pushin me around and I was cryin, but all the time I was laughin to myself. When they stuck the needle in my arm for the blood test I passed out, and when I came to they were kicking me into the wall. Then they made everybody take off their pants, and I did, and this sergeant says, Oh my God, put those back on! You fuckin swine you! Then they had a urine test and I couldnt piss, But my poop was just like ooze, man, so I poop in the cup and put it on the counter. I had poop on my hand and my arm. The guy almost puked. I was so proud. I knew I had these chumps beat. The last thing I remember was wakin up in the ear test booth and they were sweepin up. So I went home and cleaned up. They took a putty knife to me. I got the street rats out of my hair, ate some good steaks, beans, potatoes, cottage cheese, milk. A couple of days and I was ready to kick ass. And in the mail I got this big juicy 4-F. Theyd call dead people before theyd call my ass. But you know the funny thing about it? Id make an incredible army man. Id be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and Id have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin killers youd ever seen in my platoon. But I just wasnt into it. I was too busy doin my own thing, you know?

[A reference to the virtual tsunami of misinformation from republicans.] The fact is, millions of Americans dont know whats actually in health care reform because Republicans have continually drummed up false talking points to create controversy and scare their constituents (like when Fox declared that health reform would put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government). And thats what Pelosi was attesting to. When reform finally passes, the American people will find out whats really in the bill (and, equally important, whats not).

The only example you supply is from another lobbyist group and uses the politically loaded talking-point term death tax just a few sentences in. No real data is supplied: we just have to take the ranchers story at face value. So the right wingers still have a really hard time providing valid examples of all these thousands of middle class Americans supposedly losing their family ranches, farms and businesses.

26788856314,"[Members of Congress Received $238K in Farm Subsidies](http://www.ewg.org/release/members-congress-received-238k-farm-subsidies) WASHINGTON --- Environmental Working Group?s 2013 update of its Farm Subsidy Database shows that 15 members of Congress or their spouses benefitted from a total of $237,921 in taxpayer-funded farm subsidy payments last year. EWG?s compilation of farm subsidies has been searched nearly 440 million times since 2004 and is widely credited for advancing efforts to reform farm subsidies. The farm subsidy database tracks $256 billion in farm income support through commodity, crop insurance, and disaster programs and $39 billion in conservation support paid to farmers and landowners from 1995 through 2012. However, EWG is prohibited by federal law from reporting crop insurance subsidies, which now comprise two-thirds of the farm safety net. EWG and the taxpayers footing the bill cannot know which farmers, including which members of Congress, receive subsidies to buy crop insurance, said Craig Cox, EWG?s Senior Vice President for Agriculture and Natural Resources. We do know that in 2011, 26 policyholders received more than $1 million apiece in crop insurance premium support in 2011, and that more than 10,000 policyholders received more than $100,000 each. U.S. Department of Agriculture has refused to provide us with the same information for 2012. "

26789135181,"Its not really NIXED per-say. The whole story is... Farm Bill was composed of multiple parts. Two significant parts were: * support agriculture * provide supplemental nutrition (food stamps) The 2nd part was controversial, because **it was costly.** And people were using food stamps **to buy non-foods.** For some odd reason, this bill was renewed every 5 years. This time around, when renewing was needed, there were 2 versions of farm bills. * House - Cut $40 bil from the SNAP (Food Stamps). * Senate - Cut $5 bil from the SNAP (Food Stamps). Of course Democrats hated this idea of cutting from Food Stamps, and Farm bill in House **did not pass,** because Democrats thought it *cut way too much.* People got mad, and they decided to try again. Republicans decided to separate SNAP from the Agricultural benefits, and pass it through the house. This was mostly because they could not get an agreement within their party on what the terms of SNAP is. How much to cut, how to prevent fraud, etc... And, they *promised* to work on SNAP later, which Democrats dont buy. This also kills any leverage for Democrats, because once they introduce their version of SNAP, it will be **This or Nothing.** If they pass this in Senate, which will most likely not happen, unless they pass the separate SNAP bill before Senate takes up on it, the situation is like below: We currently have allocated budget for Food Stamps from the previous budget. (which will most likely be used for it) But we do not have the statement in the farm bill, that says we need to give money to Food Stamps. tl;dr: So its not Nixed yet, but it **COULD BE** Nixed"

Other members of my family are currently under the program (my sister, under 18, and several seniors in my family, but also people who are in their 30s) and they also are concerned. But I read this article and it doesnt actually explain what this means for us. Will they lose their welfare? Should I even try to apply?

27155922468,Obama hasnt really kept any promises...so theres that too. 
27112079894,"This is a half true statement yes technically the debt went up under him but that was due to programs that were approved under Bush such as the Bush tax cuts (which cost the government $3 trillion), the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which it tallies at $1.4 trillion) and the Medicare prescription drug program ($300 billion). Remember the Iraq and Afghanistan were never put on the books during the Bush administration and once Obama took office they were then accounted for. Another factor for this is inflation. Heres an excerpt from an article that fact checked the claim you are making. The claim that Obamas four deficits are the four largest in U.S. history ignores the fact that Obama inherited most of his first deficit when he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009. As we have written many times before, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Officeprojected the fiscal year 2009 deficit at $1.2 trillion two weeks before Obama took office. That fiscal year started Oct. 1, 2008. Due to some additional spending under Obama, the deficit increased to $1.4 trillion for fiscal year 2009. At the end of the fiscal year, the CBO largely blamedthe 2009 deficit on the recession, specifically a sharp decline in tax revenues and an increase in spending in response to the economic crisis  first by Bush and later by Obama. Obama is adding almost as much debt as all 43 previous presidents combined. We first looked into a similar claim back in February when it was included in a partisan graphic circulating via email and Facebook. It was wrong then, and remains so today. This claim is easily checked by plugging Obamas inauguration date ¡ª Jan. 20, 2009 ¡ª into the Treasury Department¡¯s handy ¡°debt to the penny¡± calculator. It shows that the nation¡¯s total debt stood at $10."

Its called an aristocracy, where generations of individuals are granted power and wealth not because of their achievements but because of their family name. The US was specifically founded in rejection of an Aristocratic regime. This is the source of the Estate Tax, which began in 1797, to prevent a permanent Aristocracy from ever forming in the United States. Will rich parents always be able to pass along enorumous wealth to their kids? Yes. But the American system was specifically designed to prevent a small number of families controlling vast wealth for generations simply due to an accident of birth. Each generation must prove itself by proving their worth and contributing something back to society not because you happened to be born with the right surname."

Without laws like the Estate Tax, one of the earliest taxes ever levied in the United States, 5,10, 20 generations from now the Walton family would still be billionaires. Not because they did anything to earn the money but simply because of their name. That would be an Aristocracy and that would be something the United States was founded specifically to reject. Each generation must prove its worth. Each generation must educate themselves, work hard, and contribute something back to to society. Supply Side economics (which argues that if we just make the wealthy slightly wealthier and record profitable companies slightly more profitable that money will trickle down to the rest of us somehow) and abandoning things like the Estate Tax (both current GOP policies) would undo the mechanism in place to that chips away at family estates and puts that money and assets back in the hands of the rest of society so that the individuals in the next generation have opportunities.

The fact that the grandkids or great grand kids lost the income units purchased by their family generations beforehand is ultimately a good thing for society. You should have to go out, get educated and contribute back to society.

Without any of those generations ever truly working for their wealth, contributing new ideas, generating new wealth, and increasingly cut off from the issue and concerns of the every day citizen while controlling enormous wealth and the political power that comes with it. These are the types of conditions that lead to strict class systems (where despite your intelligence, hard work, other achievements you are trapped in poverty, because the system is designed to keep the poor poor and the rich rich), revolutions (including our own in the US), civil war, bloodshed, along with the basic moral questions of why 5 generations later should the descendents of Sam Walton be living in opulent wealthy and millions of others are condemned to a life of poverty without any hope of escape.

I mean real Left, like Anarchist or Communist). What a useless pack of addled insane douchebags. Is it any wonder so many RWers think Leftists are cats paws of international bankers?"
27149176889,Maybe so but Regan had a way with words that moved a nation. Probably the most powerful speaker weve had.
27149179655,Reagan was only a good president if you were already wealthy when he was in office.
27149180540,"He probably was. Reagan talked a good budget game, but when it came to actually applying it, he was shit. Something about unnecessarily spending the Soviet Union into oblivion."
27149181474,"Rand Paul is an idiot for not know Congress makes the budget, not the President. Derp. "
27149190677,"Jimmy Carter was one of the best US presidents of recent history - not to mention what he has done after his presidency, which is exceptional and really shows where his heart is. He walks his talk."
27149200864,ITT: People not realizing this video is 6 years old.
27149202071,Yeah no shit. Reagan had the 3rd worst deficit out of all the presidents.
27149202103,"The GOP base is freaking right now between Jeb Bush talking amnesty and Rand Paul firing a shot at the Gippers fiscal shortcomings. There will come a point where the the party will pull back to center a little bit and stop eating itself, until then they will crucify anyone in their ranks that breaks from the very narrow line of ideals they have carved out for themselves until the realization that being narrow in a diverse world doesnt win you elections outside of demographics with very narrow ideals, which are becoming fewer with every decade that passes."
27149202486,I just woke up and I thought this said that Paul Rudd said that Jim Carrey was better on the budget than Ronald Reagan. Very confusing.
27149206569,Isnt that obvious? Carter was so under-rated. 
27149206899,"Ronald Reagan caused one of the worst budget problems in U.S. history by cutting taxes (reducing income) and massively increasing spending. Burning the candle at both ends. No fucking shit Carter did better than him. Anyone could have, just dont be an idiot with money. "

27149214074,"What really fucks me up is being accused of isolationism...like its a bad thing. I mean, sure global trade should be kept but meddling in everybody elses shit and potentially reducing our (expensive) military presence abroad? I have zero problems with that."
27149214755,"Random Paul. Just says any old thing. Doesnt have to make sense, or be consistent with anything else. The only common thread here is shameless attention whoring."
27149215470,Rand Paul: right twice a day.
27149216018,"You know, as a conservative (and someone who likes Reagan) I agree with him. I would like to point out, because, surprise surprise, Mother Jones doesnt; the congress was led by Dems for all of the Reagan years and about 30 years prior. Congress controls the purse strings, and Reagan cut a deal with the dems at the time to improve military spending because of the Soviets and consolidate the tax rates. To get that to happen, there was a great deal of pork and social spending put up in trade. For as much deficit as there was in those budgets, however, we bounced back and hit a period of economic growth that allowed the US to be in a place in the early 90s where we could reasonably balance the budget. You would not have had that without the growth in the 80s and early 90s. People remember the tech boom of the mid-90s, but it was not the reason we were able to balance the budget. Then we had Bush and republicans come in during the 00s and run up a ridiculous debt to prove how compassionate conservatives could be."
27149217272,Careful Rand Paul! Traitorous talk about the venerated hero Regan will likely get you primaried.
27149219474,Carter was better than Reagan on everything except he was unwilling to trade the freedom of American hostages for an election. The Reagan administration is possibly the worst presidency in American history but the revisionist history does not cover it in an honest light. 
27149220449,"Every once in a while Rand says something clever. I just wish hed stop saying so much dumb stuff along side his gems. If you look back 30-40yrs, youll notice that in terms of spending, the GOP faaaaaaaar exceeds the democrats...which is of course ironic given they claim to be fiscally responsible. "
27149220810,Ronald Reagan said he would bolster Defense over balancing the budget every single time. last weeks episode of The Americans showed a clip from the speech where he made that claim.

27149232239,"Almost every time I go out drinking with my buddy and his Dad, I get into an argument with his Dad over Jimmy Carter. The sole reason he dislikes Jimmy Carter is his handling of the Iranian hostage crisis. In his eyes, this makes him the worst president of all time."
27149241452,And this is news? Reagan destroyed the budget by slashing taxes and increasing defense spending. This isnt even controversial. It is a basic fact. 
27149248180,"if you define better as more fiscally responsible, then obviously.. Reagan and Bush II were the worst of all time."
27149255991,So how is this news? I remember vaguely my high school history teacher saying that he send 3 times more than the previous president. 
27149256082,Ouch. That was the sound of his chances of winning the GOP nomination going from minimal to zero.
27149266807,"Well, there goes Rand Paul. You have affronted the GOPs Man-God Ronnie the First. You, sir, are toast."
27149275785,There goes his chances in 2016. Thou shalt not speak ill of the Reagan (holy be His name) in the GOP. 
27149279907,Jimmy Carter was a much better president than Reagan.
27149281624,"The economy was a damned disaster-piece under Carter. Wait in line to get $5 worth of gas, so you can go wait in line to get $5 more gas. Interest rates up the wazoo. Everyone likes to say, But homes were only $40 grand. - they forget at 20% interest for 30 years. Prices for everything were going up and up, while paychecks stayed the same. You wanted to spend your paycheck to get prices before they went up, but all you could afford were eggs, milk, and cheese. But the hostages, the hostages. Reagan wasnt even president and rescued the hostages. Carters one brutal term is what you get when you get a micromanager, who thinks they know everything about everything as president. This is exactly why these to morons named Paul scare me with talk of gold standard and other such bullshit that was popular 100 years ago. The truth is, the only reason the Pauls like it, is because they can understand it. Its like trying to bring back the carburetor because I cant understand whats happening under the hood. "
27149282496,"A Republican giving a Democrat praise? THIS IS IT, GUYS. THE RAPTURE IS COMING"
27149289559,This is simply true because Carter didnt run up a huge debt like Reagan did.
27149289724,**AND THERE IS ALREADY AN UPDATE TO THE ARTICLE WHERE HE IS BACKTRACKING ON HIS COMMENTS.** *facepalm*
27149290324,"&gt; UPDATE: After this article was posted, Pauls office sent this statement from the senator: I have always been and continue to be a great supporter of Ronald Reagans tax cuts and the millions of jobs they created. Clearly spending during his tenure did not lessen, but he also had to contend with Democrat majorities in Congress. The tax cuts created jobs, but the spending didnt? ?_?"
27149291845,"Well, hes not wrong. Reagans whole plan was to out-spend the Soviet Union, and it fucked up the budget for the next 30 years. Carter had a better handle on the budget, but he also plunged us into a bad recession because he wasnt willing to spend to stabilize the economy. "
27149294050,"I dont know enough about Carter to comment on his legacy; I know he inherited a mess from Nixon and Fords misadventure in Vietnam ( funny that, this democrat cycle of inheriting Republican messes) -- I do know Reagan was a nutter and that he (along with Thatcher in the UK) instituted their radical neo-liberal policies of tax cuts for the wealthiest and the de-regulation of markets that history will tell us was the beginning of the end of Americas golden era. "
27149297931,Do these politicians not realize that we live in a time where anything that theyve said publically is easily retrieved to rub in their smug little faces when they try to lie? So stuck in the past. 
27149299273,I dont want Rand Paul to lose a presidential bid because Republicans see him as one more to add to their ever-growing pile of not true Republicans to demonize. Folks should lose elections for clear and repeated acts of disingenuousness. The (R)s have such an enormous list of folks theyre trying to please without actually letting anyone know that Id be surprised if they could ever come up with someone capable of cutting through all the crap. Just the fear of fiscal conservatives to appear weak on defense is enough of a fundamental conflict of interest to keep me from entertaining the party in the near future. But Congress will probably be violently overthrown before *that* ever changes.
27149300012,"My reaction if true: Well, bye bye Rand Paul. Was nice knowing ya. Way to commit political suicide!"
27149302462,And? Rand Paul is still a racist dickhead fucking asshole with a made up medical degree. He can still GTFO.
27149309122,Who cares. they are gone. Focus on whats in front of us geez
27149312149,"Somebody is making an appeal to the left in preparation for a presidential run. While I agree with him, Im not impressed. I do not think much on his idea of a budget. "
27149312560,Paul shares one trait with Reagan: Alzheimers syndrome.
27149320874,"Man, this guy is throwing more red meat than a hot dog vendor."
27149321090,"brave move, discrediting the conservative Jesus like that."
27149321508,"Its a bold strategy, Cotton. Lets see if it pays off for em. "
27149340079,Hes right. Im surprised to hear it. But he is right. Reagan was simply too incompetent on management and economics to be good on the budget. 
27149342747,"Except for every presidential historian who disagrees, putting Carter toward the back with the worst residents, and Raegan at the front/front-middle depending on who you ask. "
27149345032,"This is one of the reasons I like the Paul family. While I may not agree on all of their views, at least they say what they believe, regardless of whether it toes the party line."
27149356517,"Wait, people think Reagan was good at budgeting? "
27149370354,"Broken clock, etc."
27149371452,I can only imagine the wing nuts heads exploding at this........even though its clearly true.
27149377066,"If Rand Paul wants to engage younger voters, maybe he should spend more time making comparisons between presidents who younger voters were actually alive to remember."
27149377494,Jimmy Cater is a dumbass and ruined the Middle East....i.e. Iran
27149382236,"He already back-pedaled...after all, cant repeat facts if they disagree with the insane opinions of your extremely right-wing base. The mans got a primary to win, he cant let things like facts or being principled get in the way of winning (more campaign donations). "
27149384208,"lol Yeah and water is wet, anyone who actually believed in Reaganomics was/is a dim-witted numbskull."
27149388108,I would also like to point out that it was Paul Volkers actions as fed chairman under Carter that laid the framework for a large part the economic recovery the Reagan administration gets credit for. Carter was actually one of the better presidents as far as forward thinking policies that will be good for the USA long term. Point in case the solar water heating system that was installed in the white house then ripped out later (by Reagan I think as well). Part of the reason Carter is reviled was that Volker set the interest rates extremely high to deal with all the inflation that was hurting the purchasing power of Americans. This resulted in home loans with interest rates you would expect a credit card to have these days.

27149395601,"Reagan was fucking terrible. But, of course, he just happened to be President while the Soviet Union was collapsing, so that makes him the great. Somehow."

27149414797,"And hes correct, there is a lot of revision involved in the current deification of Reagan by the right."

As a left leaning libertarian (social liberal, UBI fan, and border zone on economics) I really want to get behind this dude but cant get over his neocon, tea party, pro life connections. It was funny reading about Republicans being in a fit over Rands view of Cheney...further proving that being a good little neocon, or neoliberal, means you have to ignore the last 15 years. The millennial generation have spent their entire adult lives dealing with war and deceit from the government and have watched the nation tank its own economy.....who really thinks the GOP and hard left Dems are gonna last when there are no more greatest generation and boomers to fluff the vote?"

27149514710,Honest question: Why does everyone hate Rand Paul on r/politics?
27149525270,"well, duh ... "
27149533885,"Rand understands that he needs to go through the current system to even have a chance of being in contention for the presidential nomination. I feel once he moves past the primary stage and into the general election, he will become much more open in his views. Nader has tried it, Perot tried going on his own too and it just doesnt work out. Even if you dont agree with a lot of what he says, the guy is pretty astute. Once he has the hopes of the Republican part behind him he can start calling the shots. "
27149539790,Im not a political expert by any means and I dont really have much of an opinion about Carter but my parents hate him. They say the really messed up the farming industry. What did he do? Did he really mess it up or did he just change things to things the farmers didnt like?
27149547420,Rand Paul? Commence Reddits liberal circlejerk!

27149572132,"While true, that doesnt mean Ron Paul understands economics."
27149573097,"Carter set Reagan up for success. He implemented policies that brought interest rates back to single digits as predicted, yet people like Hannity point to double digit inflation rates as proof of his failure. Those double digit interest rates were there when he took office."
27149585996,"Have we ever REALLY had a bad president? Sure, we have had some lame ducks and guys who just had nothing to do (Im looking at you Garfield!) but to be fair, when you are president and there isnt a war going on or a financial crisis, you look pretty lazy lol. I always liked Carter and Reagan. I am a democrat too, but you can see the changes both men made in history. Plus, Reagan hated hippies and that made me happy. Now I have to rewatch that movie where some Reagan look alike goes around killing hippies... Wtf was it called lol"

27149686845,So Carter is the Democratic Reagan? Mind = blown.
27149691698,Are pigs flying? Did hell freeze over? A member of the GOP openly admits that Reaganomics was shit and Carter did much better? I cant believe it happened.

My mind is blown that Carter is seen as the worst president. I wouldnt vote for either of them, but I have more issues with Reagan than I have ever had with Carter. Edit: Also, I seriously dont even think I can vote for Rand Paul. The guy is just terrible. I get that he was just backing Romney so that he could have more success when he runs in 2016, but its just so hard to take him seriously at this point. "

Yeah, the Iran hostage situation and gas crisis hovers over almost anything from that four years, but its not like ol Jimmy asked the students to take them hostage or flew the helicopter into the plane in the Iranian desert. Eagle Claw was no less daring or preposterous than the mission to kill UBL. I wager history will be much kinder to Carter than W. thinks it will be to him."

26883009038,"The point was large tech and science corporations in Texas are not a good explanation for a political shift. It can be better explained by the GOPs unwillingness to move with the times or immigration.

Also, just looking at white people that graduated college, McCain had a 48 point lead. "
26881700250,"how does my comment make no sense? Also, I did not say that all engineers/scientists are democrats. Youre implying a statement that I did not make and conversation that I did not encourage. Also I work with Republicans that are engineers so no, I do not believe that, however, I think that since a large portion of engs/scientists ARE liberal leaning or support many liberal programs that they help to influence politics. I am one and constantly surrounded by it. I worked with TI many, many times (Mainly Proc Design and LEDs) and a ton of them are not from Texas, but rather move there. Nanotech personal and EEs are a plenty and quite a few of them are liberals. Also, I did not say those companies are the REASON for the change, but rather that they are encouraging it since who they employ decides what kind of votes take place. There is no doubting that tech companies are largely liberal and with it bring those politics with them is my point, just look at hoe much Texas conservatives are losing the votes in large cities like Dallas and Austin. I made a short, general statement. I have no idea where you got your info. "

26887638170,This. I wish the shutdown shutdown the military as well. Go big or go home. Instead Hagel put all the DoD workers back to work via some tricky reasoning.

These days a masters degree is the new bachelors in terms of worth. So if you make education so expensive that most people cannot afford it, then what do you expect to happen? the people who can afford it do it and everyone else just simply cannot. People with the education go on to make money while people without, in most cases, literally cannot make that some amount of money. If you really want it you will get it, plain and simple, but you could waste 10 years worth of your money on paying back loans instead of using the money for so many other things. I honesty believe that if the cost of education was reasonable then opportunities for the middle class would skyrocket. "

Income equality does not lead to social mobility or prosperity. Income equality is a consequence, not a cause. Aiming for better income equality is not a magic bullet to making a better society. There are several countries that have better levels of income equality than America. I shouldnt have to tell anyone here that European countries have higher income equality than America, but there are several other examples that may surprise you: [India, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, even Ethiopia have better levels of income equality than America](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/GINI_retouched_legend.gif) So if you can have prosperous nations with higher income equality than America and you can have backwaters like Ethiopia with a higher level of income equality than America, then the rule of correlation =/= causation applies here and, as I said, it is not all it is made out to be.

(2) Many groups in the lower 50% intentionally claim lower income (cash hairdressers, bartenders). Also pension accruals whose accrual (a form of wealth) is paid tax-free. Also health plans. The right way to perform this study is who SPENDS the most money over a lifetime and consumes the most goods (college in US = college in Canada). Or, study net worth.

There was no plan to reset the chess board and start over again with everyone on level playing field again. The rich get richer...And they have. Inequality is just a biproduct of hundreds of years of concentration of wealth. Everyone is fighting for the same piece of bread. Those with lots of bread are continually collecting more and the crumbs become fewer and farther between. Im not saying its good.

26856401145,"The problem is that money equals debt. From the very moment of money creation, there is interest attached to the dollar, whether loaned to a major commercial bank or exchanged to the government. Then the major commercial bank only releases the money to citizens as more loans with more interest... Think about it, the scarcity is manufactured, because the system can only survive by taking out loans to pay off old loans. Money will never flow to sectors of the population that need it because by the very definition of a debt based economy, there has to be continually more losers in the marketplace. In addition, controlling wealth creation and being on the ownership end of debt allows the major banks to continuously consolidate their wealth and power. Eliminating interest would be fair practice capitalism, and would result in a massively more even equality. It is something that teapartiers and occupy activists can both get behind. No need for scary words like socialism, where you are centralizing the power of money elsewhere, where it is still prone to abuse by psychopaths."

26856546385,"Is the problem income inequality, or standard of living?"
26856547553,"My take on all this is that wealth inequality really has to do with the corporate sector owning the government and spending the last 40 years shaping the system to their favour. Forget about the whole left or right thing. Thats more of a red herring at this point since both parties are connected via corporate influence and both fall under capitalist dogma. I tend to look at it like this: On one side, you have citizens. On the other side is corporations. In the middle is the government. Its like a teeter totter when it should be a set of scales. You want balance between the public and industry. Over the last few decades however, its been corporations tipping the scales in their favour. So now the public needs to re-balance the scales. Socialism is treated as an ugly word by Capitalists. This is because their ideological core is built on greed while Socialism is based on sharing. How much money does one person need? Do they win a prize for having the most? Does it make them better people? Since the 80s, Ive watched how the rich have gone from being well off to super rich, and how the executive class has absolutely destroyed manufacturing and unions in the US. All the cheap shit you guys buy from Wal Mart and practically every other store is made in factories outside of the US. Some are actually inside the US, but its made by low paid prisoners on work programs. In the 50s, at the height of The American Dream, people were able to afford to buy all that stuff because the products were made in the US which created jobs, and because of growing labour laws and factory unions, workers were paid a fair wage while execs &amp; CEOs didnt take home the kinds of insane salaries they get now. Seriously, find me one person who is worth the salary of 200 or 300 employees and Ill show you Superman. Some Ivy League Wall Street connected dick isnt really worth much more than anyone else personally. Ive seen janitors that do more to insure the stability of a company than the owners. Restaurants cant run without dishwashers. People seriously undervalue the working class. In the 80s, companies discovered they could close factories, kill off unions, and send the jobs to places like China, Taiwan, India, etc and pay less to non unionized, exploited labour. Sweatshops, child workers, 14 hour work days, unsafe conditions. These companies killed whole towns by cutting costs and giving themselves raises. Detroit just went bankrupt. A whole fucking city. Thats insane, and no one does shit about it, because a by-product of wealth inequality, is social segregation. The US media depicts poor people poorly. Socially dysfunctional retards who are either criminals or white trash. It tends to make the middle class unwilling to want to help them. Most of reddits demographics is middleclass white kids who have no idea what real poverty is like and think the ghetto is like an Ice Cube movie or The Wire. Chicago is horrible for wealth disparity. thanks Obamas friends. You have massive black on black violence which is nationally under-reported, in some of the poorest communities, while just a few blocks away, you have some of the wealthiest people in the city. Theres no comfort in that. Chicago is closing 50 inner city schools. There was protests. Again, very little coverage. The system itself is rigged on all levels against the public and its only going to keep getting worse unless you guys actually work together on a public level to fix things."
26856552946,"So? Why do liberals always bitch about income inequality in the US? Even if youre poor in america and make, lets say 25,000 a year. Youre still better off than 80+% of the world. Take this common statistic that liberals like to bitch about: The richest 1% hold 40% of the wealth. When you put that statistic into a reference frame, it seems more reasonable. In order to own wealth, you must have a positive net worth. If you have $1000 in your checking account and owe $5000 in credit card debt, your net worth is -$4000. Which means you have less wealth than someone with no credit card debt and a nickle in his hand."

The concept that the average worker is earning less now than they were in 1978 might be an issue worth solving, but it also might be a stat pulled right out of someones ass. Are those dollar amounts directly comparable to each other? Do they mean anything relative to the average cost of living in 1978 vs today? Why was 1978 chosen (it seems rather arbitrary)? If someone makes more money than they would reasonably spend in a year, does it really matter how much more they make than that amount? It is my perspective that inequality is not a problem. Poverty is a problem. Abuse is a problem. Corruption is a problem. Well, maybe it is a first world problem (a la Sue cant decide between lobster or filet mignon for lunch). "

26856588283,"The entire conceptual model employed by this headline is a contrivance for the sake of a political agenda. No nation has any distribution of income. Nations are abstractions that often group disparate people, pursuing disparate goals, arbitrarily together. There is no such thing as a distribution of income - everyone generates their own particular income via their own endeavor; income does not originate in some aggregation thats subsequently divided unequally among different people. When people talk about distribution of income, theyre adding everyones separate incomes together, then analyzing who has a higher or lower proportion of that total; but no one ever seems to posit any justification for aggregating everyones separate income values into a single figure in the first place."

Its gone through the roof, while they make the rank and file people that do the really hard work, work for peanuts, then come up with bullshit hoops for them to jump through. The corporations get away with murder because no one questions them."
26856605576,"I think people now are just complacent. It used to be that both Republicans and Democrats new how bad income inequality was for society. Republicans especially since they are the party of capital knew that it was a bad idea to try and crush the working class and squeeze everything out of them or youd start to develop a social movement away from capitalism, since throughout the early to mid 20th century social economic movements were succeeding everywhere. With capitalism taking over in most parts of the world things have changed. Just like within a capitalist economy you need competition to keep things going, capitalism itself needs competition to keep things right. The capitalists at the top have to want capitalism to work and show its better than whatever other system the workers want, that doesnt happen anymore. Ever since capitalism won the cold war, capitalism as a viable sustainable economic model, free from revolution and benefitting those willing to put in the work is declining quickly. "
26856606850,From number 1 to number last.
26856608605,"Im not sure why this is a bad thing. Why is unequal distribution of income an intrinsically bad thing? Why arent we allowed to have some rich people and some (or, in this case, many) poor people? The poverty standard is still light years beyond third world countries. I have big issues with people being cheated or short-changed or hamstrung in their drive to success, but as I look back on my own life, Ive been willing to make less money as a trade off for other, more valuable things, like time with my wife and family. I dont expect to compensated the same as, for example, my boss. In fact, I sort of wear it as a badge of honor that Im willing to give up income for these better options."

If some poor fuck is on welfare vs welfare or minimum wage vs slightly higher minimum wage now. The problem is social movement. Its now far less likely for someone born into poverty to become middle class or rich. Which is really the goal of the USA; the american dream is about having the very poor and the very rich and through your own skill you become what you earn. So if you are good at what you do... for example a really good pig farmer you could become uber rich. However if youre a total fuckup you forever live in poverty. The problem is that you can be really good at what you do but for some reason in the USA you never tend to promote yourself.

Ive realized, and it aint news, that the US is just a warmachine and our politicians are the world salesmen. But I feel as if we are waiting for bad things to happen just to pounce on a country and take control of it... honestly there are worse things happening every day somewhere than what happened in Syria, not saying it wasnt/isnt horrific and that it shouldnt be fixed, but I am just saying people are getting fucked up everywhere by everything. We are all mostly, in 1st world countries , disconnected from war because we are accustomed to running water, tons of the fattiest/carbiest/delicious-est food buyable in seconds, AC in our cars that run on everyones damn oil, and Miley Cyrus twerking (why not).

STOP FEEDING IT and take it out with specialists (antibodies) instead of starting wars. Motherfuckers. Anyway, there are too many people struggling here.

27025111471,"I appreciate you providing other sources for your claim. Now, if we look at the history of estate taxation, it has a very stormy one. Until 1916, estate taxation was used to fund wars, and was repealed soon after. In fact, the very proponent you first mentioned(Jefferson) was elected on his isolationist policies, and he along with Congress repealed the estate taxation in 1802, just 5 years after it was enacted. So even though they intermittently supported it, it was obvious they didnt support it to the extent in which it currently exists today. "
27024807686,"I think its rather intellectually dishonest to say that the founding fathers wanted to limit inheritance and as evidence you list the opinion of *one* of the founding fathers. If indeed many, or most of the fathers had held this opinion that this was necessary, why did we not have a consistent estate tax until 1916? Furthermore, if you read what Jefferson wanted to do, it was to stop primogeniture inheritance, where the eldest got everything, and have it so it was equal among the deceaseds heirs. "

26939182918,"Not only was Part D unfunded but it was passed specifically without cost-reduction measures that exist in other parts of Medicare. This was a two-pronged policy. On the one hand it was to court the votes of the all-important elderly voting bloc for the upcoming 2004 presidential election, which somewhat worked. Passing the bill would also benefit pharmaceutical companies (our tax dollars used to subsidize the purchase of their pills) and keeping out cost-reduction measures would have the pharmaceuticals benefiting even more. The Democrats, who have a priority of expanding social services, were willing to pass it without funding because it was the only way it was going to get passed. Republicans in the House were actually against it (because they are against expansion of social services) but the vote was held open for an unusually long time (until 4am) until enough Republican arms could be twisted to get the bill passed.

Hes talking about turning massive unemployment into massive underemployment and poverty. Yes, in that reality hes constructed in his head more people will have jobs. But something else will happen: people who already have jobs wont be able to *live* on those jobs because companies will gut benefits and cut wages exactly as fast and as deep as the government allows them to. The wealth gap will increase, the middle class will shrink, and all of the benefits will ripple up while all of the detriments of such as system will be squarely placed on the shoulders of the least in society."

Factor in children and seniors as well as people disabled enough to be unable to work, college students not looking as well as others who have voluntarily removed themselves from the workforce (stay at home parents, etc.) and sure, the number of people not working is quite high. However, that isnt an accurate portrayal of the American workforce. My straight-out-of-my-ass suspicion is that the real number - meaning people who want to work and cant get it and people who want to work more than they are currently- is somewhere between 10-15%. "

College kids with rich parents, stay at home moms, and older folk that are retired are willingly unemployed, not as a result of economic hardships.

The fact that workforce participation has gone down 5% or so during a period where unemployment has also dipped about 5% tells us nothing we shouldnt expect.

27054373862,Wow. Youll believe anything the Obama spin machine cooks up wont you? No job lock hence less people working increases productivity? We are doomed.
27054346039,"Short answer: I think the law wont affect you much if you have insurance through an employer. As I understand it, you will pay more through an exchange because right now your company pays for some of your plan and you pay for some of it with pre-tax dollars. You would have to spend post-tax money through an exchange, your company would pay nothing, and you may not qualify for any subsidies. But the idea is open competition and everyone having insurance will drive those prices down some. Someone who works at a company with no health care can use pre-tax money and get subsidies. So that could give you the option of switching to a new job without healthcare and getting it through the exchange for an affordable price, and the option of keeping that insurance when you went to another job. If you lose your job you will qualify for more subsidies, or maybe medicare. But I am no expert on this."

27054328492,"1) Id like to see a link on that, but are you comparing staying at a job you because you want to with job-lock? Americans no longer get pensions and companies rarely try to keep employees for long periods anymore. I dont think Ive worked anywhere more than 3 or 4 years while my dad (who has a pension) worked 45 years for the same company and resisted retiring until 68. Meanwhile, I had a coworker who had to quit and work elsewhere so his wife could continue to see her doctor when our health plans changed. That would never occur in almost all the rest of the developed world. Nor even Cuba... 2) Im not sure if you are saying having a stay-at-home parent is not good for a family or just commenting? 3) I did not know that. I would argue its obviously true for things like vaccines, or managing a disease like diabetes that can send people to the ER, but overall apparently it is not. But regardless, if the price is the same for letting Americans die of preventable diseases or allowing them to live a long and productive life, call me a crazy liberal but Im for the latter."

Are you suggesting we have a 0% unemployment rate, so that if a worker took themselves out of the workforce that job would remain empty and unproductive? Because I can assure you that is not the case: there are people who want to be working and productive but currently cant get work or are underemployed, and would quickly replace the people who no longer wanted to work. And theres a good chance people who want to work will be more productive than people who dont want to work when doing the same job, at least after some initial ramping-up period.

26818085018,"&gt; Actually, what you said wasnt true. The Middle Class DOES spend as much as Northern European in taxes. [Really? Where the heck did you get that idea?](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/10/focus-4) Our middle class is siginificantly lower taxed than Northern Europe. [A middle class person in the US is going to pay roughly half in overall taxes compared to Sweden or Denmark.](http://www.ibtimes.com/tax-rates-individual-workers-pay-oecd-member-nations-rose-2012-led-netherlands-poland-slovak-1151019) &gt;So your assertion that Americans are lazy, greedy and selfish just sounds like more corporatist talking points. Um...where did you get that? A corporatist wouldnt be saying that taxes need to increase. A corporatist would be saying taxes should be lowered. I think you need to understand the definition of a term before you start throwing it around. &gt;Your Americans-are-bad propaganda just reeks of stuff you picked up from TV. TV owned by the corporations. What? You are delusional. &gt;And the corporate solution? Keep corporate taxes at almost zero, and raise taxes on the already-dying American Middle Class. You might want to do some research on corporate taxation. Increasing corporate taxes hurts the middle class. That is why nearly all economists, even left-leaning ones and Keynesians, support a lower corporate tax rate.

26818248722,"Historically most of Europe has had revolutions or purges where the wealthy are drug out into the streets and shot, beheaded, hung, drawn and quartered.

"
26818071090,"Actually, what you said wasnt true. The Middle Class DOES spend as much as Northern Europeans in taxes. Youre thinking only in terms of FEDERAL income taxes and not calculating in state and local taxes. When you add BOTH federal *and* state taxes, the average American pays about as much as a Swede. Yet gets almost none of the same services that the Swede does. Well, then where is the money going? Answer: Military spending, and pork that ends up going to corporations like Walmart. (Go Google how much tax money Walmart gets from average citizens, through their lobbyists and bought politicians). So your assertion that Americans are lazy, greedy and selfish just sounds like more corporatist talking points. And the corporate solution? Keep corporate taxes at almost zero, and raise taxes on the already-dying American Middle Class. Good job spreading their disinformation!!! Let me guess your solution: 1) Keep corporate taxes at historical lows, 2) Raise taxation on the already-strangled Middle Class in one of the deepest recessions in US history, 3) Cut services and social security benefits to said Middle Class.

I often ask myself if what we pay would be enough, if only there werent so many people funneling it away on ridiculous projects or into their own accounts. Then consider the people driving our lawmakers to enforce or strike down policies (in short, big business), which have repeatedly proven to not have the best interests of our people at heart. The icing on the cake is the part of our country which, because of big business influence, have been convinced that providing any additional government benefits would be detrimental to our societys drive to persevere, cry socialism, or say its wasteful when its really just going to cut into someones exorbitant profits. In short, there are too many corrupt politicians, counterintuitive policies and stupid assholes for it to work. Maybe some day well get our shit together."

26818017001,"&gt; Well, lets be completely honest. Americans, as taxpayers, are selfish as fuck. People on the right want to pay as little taxes as possible, and people on the left want way more than what they are willing to pay for. Basically, we want to be a European-style social democracy, but we dont want to have to pay for it. Consider our government healthcare spending ([e.g.,](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/23/chart_us_government_spends_more_on_health_care_than_the_canadian_government.html)). Our government spends more than enough to provide a European style universal healthcare system, but we have our awful system that leaves tens of millions of us without access to healthcare. What can we draw from this fact? At very least, Americans have little problem with immense wasteful spending for programs they support (i.e., medicare). If Americans were stingy and cheap, Why would the government be forbidden from bargaining for prescription drug [prices](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/tammy-baldwin/uncle-sam-barred-bargaining-medicare-drug-prices-s/)?

Clinton only signed minor tax increases (3% increase on top earners, and 1% increase on payroll tax), but he also cut the capital gains tax by nearly a third (not a terrible policy), and eliminated numerous tariffs. Considering what people are now starting to ask for from our government, the rates under Clinton would still likely be too low. Go look at what a middle class person in Germany or France is paying in taxes compared to what a middle class person in the United States pays. We pay very little, but expect a lot."

People on the right want to pay as little taxes as possible, and people on the left want way more than what they are willing to pay for. Basically, we want to be a European-style social democracy, but we dont want to have to pay for it. Until we figure that out, we are going to continue to be in this mess. We cant just tax the rich our way to prosperity. All of us are going to have to do our part if we want these services. Our middle class pays very little in taxes compared to much of Europe, yet we feel that it is ridiculous that we dont have similar services. We need to stop being so childish as a nation. A social democracy isnt taxing the rich to pay for the rest of the people, it is everyone doing their part. When both parties take a hard-lined stance on not letting temporary tax breaks expire, you know that it is going to be difficult to pay for the services we demand. We need to figure it out sooner rather than later: are we going to be a low-tax, low-service nation, or are we going to increase our taxes to a reasonable level to pay for the services we demand?"
26818124813,"you nailed it. Americans are childish in the extreme when it comes to taxation and the greater good. Endless money for wars and prisons, no money for healthcare and education. "

If they were TRULY selfish they would *want* these things as everyone, including themselves, would benefit, resulting in a better society which they are a part of. But Americans are short-sighted and know not how to foresee long-term benefits. Its all short-term gains and cheap thrills, not investment and cultivating a future. I think lack of proper critical thinking skills developing through, ahem, **education** is what is lacking and causing this. Unfortunately they refuse to provide said education, so a viscous cycle of ignorance is propagated. Our culture even goes so far as to villainize educated citizens as elitist."
26818282402,"&gt;People on the right want to pay as little taxes as possible, and people on the left want way more than what they are willing to pay for. And thats the issue, we no longer have a debate where people come together and realize that these two polar ideas *cant* exist together. Instead, we have a government that tries to *make* them exist together. Worse than that, weve framed the argument that only polar opposite ideas are valid, and each side just makes the other worse. And the bureaucratic system in DC continues to sludge along not accomplishing anything, feeding the people who perpetuate the system because it feeds them. They wont do the right thing, because they live for the argument which helps divide the population, which keeps them in office living the high life.

I also think its too bad that those are the kinds of people who would have gone bankrupt if they had a major medical emergency.

A few million people are going to lose their shit health insurance. Where are the insurance companies in the debate? They knew for years now. Why were they still selling substandard plans? Of those millions of people, how many of them are going to end up paying more when you take Medicaid expansions into account? Well, Medicaid expansions *assuming your state didnt refuse the expansion*. Or subsidies in general. I am having difficulty fully engaging my care-clutch when the primary source of this noise is from people who have a vested interest in making sure the ACA implementation fails as loudly as possible. &gt; Forbes predicts that 93 million will lose their insurance plans once the employer mandate kicks in. Insurances companies have been cancelling plans and arbitrarily increasing rates for literally decades now. The ACA puts down some pretty basic minimums: * https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/essential-health-benefits/ &gt; Essential health benefits must include items and services within at least the following 10 categories: ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care. None of that strikes me as unreasonable. When THIS MANY PEOPLE are going to lose coverage it just supports every study that shows how tens of millions of Americans are underinsured for their basic needs. &gt; It is getting nothing but bad press.

27032451506,"read the article. The cuts to the food stamp program come from closing a loophole that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed needed to be addressed. A households level of monthly food stamps benefits is determined by how much disposable income a family has after rent, utilities, and other expenses are deducted. Some states allow beneficiaries to deduct a standard utility charge from their income if they qualify for a federal heating aid program called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), even if they only receive a few dollars per year in heating aid. The arrangement results in about 850,000 households getting a utility deduction that is much larger than their actual utility bill. Because the deduction makes these families disposable income appear to be lower than it actually is, they get more food stamp money each month. The farm bill that passed the House on Wednesday saves $9 billion by closing that loophole. if anything, this is GOOD. people should be treated fairly - all people. this loophole artificially allowed some to take more than others, which i dont think anyone wants to happen. not al money spent on foodstamps is good investment, the same way not all money spent on defence is a good investment. eventually, government needs to decrease in size, not increase."

27031851866,"Screw you, poors. - Sincerely, the 113th United States Congress"
27031857337,And all the while the Democrats call the Republicans obstructionists. This is called the compromise that they say they have demanded for years now. So are the Democrats actually wanting compromise? The simple answer friends is - -apparently not! Republicans didnt get the spending cuts they wanted and that 9 billion in food stamp cuts is over a 10 year period. (A rounding error in a more than a 1 trillion dollar budget) Members of both parties warned that further cuts to the military would hollow out the military and cost U.S. jobs.

27031890392,This is just asinine!

27031912657,"If you give someone free food, housing, medical, phones,etc., why would they ever try to get off the free stuff? Im asking as a real question, mainly because you see people that are 3rd generation draw recipients and they have been taught to live like this. Using food stamps to buy sodas to resell for cash $.30 on the dollar, being obese, and watching TV all day in a trailer. How does it help them in the long run? Or a better question might be, what else could we (govt) do that would be better. "

27032019128,honest question. why doesnt obama veto the measure? it seems like every other day i heard about bush vetoing things that came to him. since obama doesnt have to run for reelection what does he have to lose in vetoing it if he actually thinks its a bad policy
27032030706,Nobody is going to starve because of this. The program never reached those people before this. 
27032050916,"Good, cuts need to be made somewhere and thats the place to do it. I dont have an issue helping people in need but the problem with programs like food stamps is people taking advantage of the system. I used to work at a grocery store and youd be surprised and what people try to pull as well as what class of people use them. I had many middle class customers pull out an EBT card, people who dont need it."
27032063479,Then they blame Obama. Sigh...
27032065696,MURRIKA!
27032065840,"So I guess were only 2 missed meals from revolution, now?"
27032066569,good. maybe you should have made better life choices so you dont end up on food stamps in the first place. you shouldnt be rewarded for popping out babies without a good career or plan in mind to support yourself or children.

27032101471,"One great lesson of history is that you can do pretty much anything you want as a government so long as you keep the people fed. Well-fed people tend not to risk life and limb in revolution no matter how ridiculous the rest of the system becomes. Another great lesson of history is that the power elite just cant seem to help themselves... they ought to know all they have to do is feed people (not even expensive in this day and age) and they can get away with anything. And yet, inevitably, time and again through history, they somehow forget this simple point and, well... plenty of examples on how that turns out for them."
27032102230,"Whatever war you guys are fighting, it is not working. War on drugs = more drugs, war on terror = more terror. War on poverty = more poverty.

They are interested in extending their programs, increase their own saleries and not end their apointment. "

Both parties wanted cuts just one wanted a lot more than the other. I would say it is a pretty good compromise, however I dont agree that there should of been any cuts."
27032205806,Im ok with people not being able to buy cigarettes and lottery tickets. No reason why someone on food stamps should be eating lobster when I cant afford lobster and Im not on food stamps.

27032217095,Why has no-one raised the issue of food stamps themselves? Forcing people to fulfill their basic human needs by using special (i.e. non-standard) tokens seems to be pretty degrading to me. Kind of strengthens the otherness of the poor to my mind.
27032217312,Both the Senate and President Barack Obama are expected to approve the legislation. I BLAME BUSH!!!!!!

27032224108,"Could be worse: House Republicans drafted new legislation slashing $40 billion from the food stamp program. That bill passed the House with Republican votes only. After months of negotiations with the Democrat-controlled Senate, which wanted much lower cuts of around $4 billion, the House finally passed a farm bill 251-166 Wednesday that contains a compromise $9 billion in reductions to the food stamp program."
27032224100,Raised poor and now I upper middle. Most people on welfare are on it because they can be. With no motivation to lift themselves up they will continue to subsist on assistance simply because they can.

27032239624,"And why are so many people living in poverty? 3 words: Barack Hussein Obama. More entitlements have been handed out under his rule than at any other time in US history. More people on food stamps than at any other time in history. And the Democrats only want to hand out more and more and more so that people will be more reliant on government. Why would you want to vote Santa Claus out of office? The leeches and the parasites have their collective hands out saying, Gimme more! Its disgusting."
27032239865,You all should do a little research on who gives more to charities and the poor. Let me help you out.. It isnt Democrats. 
27032240162,"I am a mental health worker that facilitates client access to foodstamps and Medicaid. If Im out in the community with them, I help my clients use their EBT cards to purchase food/drink.

27032245095,Yay!!! fuck the poor.... that **IS** the GOP/right-wing message made clear.... less food = less poor people.
27032250585,"Get ready for the personal experience evidence- I worked at Walmart as a cashier for a couple summers in college. Middle class to poor city, so lots of food stamps came through my line. That experience changed a lot of my outlook on government aid. About 80% of the money spent was on things my own hardworking family didnt even buy because it wasnt cost effective- Im talking name brand cereal, STEAKS, cases of not-generic sodas, etc. I learned then that people will very freely spend money that is not theirs. In my experience- which since then has been AMPLE due to my current job- there is a wave of entitlement that is spreading like a virus. It frustrates me to no end, and it gives hardworking people that really DO need a little help a bad rap. Ive personally seen hundreds of thousands of dollars just handed out like Halloween candy to people who turn around and complain because as a country were still not doing enough and are only in it for the money. I think charity is an essential part of a moral society. But this shit is getting ridiculous. "
27032251249,"But, I mean, this is good, right? Now all the poor people who just needed motivation to go out and find a job will find themselves in a wonderland of opportunity! The rich and affluent run a ton of multimillion-dollar companies that have piles of jobs available for these people! I mean, sure: Many of the jobs available dont pay enough to survive, forcing the people working them into social assistance programs that are now having their funding cut, but that just serves to motivate people to take jobs that dont pay enough to survive, so theyre forced to rely on social assistance programs that are now having their funding cut ... Huh. I wonder if the people responsible for this shit see this vicious cycle from their lofty perches atop their ivory towers?"
27032251635,This title is biased.... The poor should go get jobs then
27032252408,"This is a 1% cut to a program that had doubled since like 2008, dont make it a bigger deal than it is. Even dems wanted some cuts. "
27032254717,Outstandingly good news!
27032256022,Keep telling yourself that Republicans won this and Democrats won that. 
27032256472,A 1% symbolic cut... oh the fucking horror. Next.
27032256868,Isnt this closing a loophole and will only be cutting the program by 1% over ten years?
27032258783,Starvation might actually nudge the impoverished masses into action. 
27032259994,Do you guys honestly think food stamps are so great? We need to create public sector jobs.
27032260639,"I absolutely believe that cuts need to be made to this program, as I have also seen it abused first hand. I went to a high school where I was considered rich just because my family wasnt on any government assistance, even though we were barely middle class. The people I saw on a daily basis would wear *thousands* of dollars worth of designer clothing, start having children at age 12 (literally went to middle school with pregnant girls....), drop out at 16, and live off of government assistance for the rest of their lives because no one was going to stop them. I have no problem helping others that need it who are actually trying to improve their lives and just are having bad luck, but the widespread abuse needs to stop. I think Congress should try to set some of that money aside to investigate people that are on these programs, and enact stricter rules about being on them (i.e. time limits....if you are unemployed and arent actively trying to find a job or go to school when on benefits, then they get cut). "
27032262639,"The strange thing is, I was getting food stamps while Bush was still in office. While he was in, food stamp benefits just kept going up and up. To the point where they were giving us crazy amounts per month. More than Id spend even if I had a good paying job and no problem buying my own food. And this was while I DID have a job, so it was just supplementary because minimum wage is too low, I guess. Its done nothing but go down ever since, from what Ive heard. Everything about the GOP is nuts, this just confirms it."
27032263812,I hope this drop in the bucket really does something. I really do. Because I dont want to have to see the Democrats stand before a starving America saying we told you so. Id rather we the Democrats lose the argument and the Republicans be right than be right this time.
27032264033,Wow
27032266932," I agree that there needs to be a program like food stamps, but the current system is not working. I am not saying this stuff about the people who actually need it. I heard this quote at the grocery store yesterday, Hold on I have to go get my food stamp card because all I have is cash. It was sickening. Or how about the people who get cash on their food stamps and then they take cash off of their food stamp card to buy beer and cigarettes. Another example, I saw a lady who had a food stamp card from two different states. If you think this is a good system then you are blind. I dont think it is right that people have to pay for other peoples mistakes. I think it should be as hard to get food stamps as it is disability. It should take months for someone to get approved for food stamps and that should only be after it is proven that they would starve to death without them. Then the should be drug tested and it should only be for a certain amount of time. "
27032268680,"Its a ~10% reduction to a program that has tripled in cost in the last 6-7 years. The program SHOULD rise and fall with the economy. The Democrats are all giddy about how great the economy is doing, so why are there still so many people that need food stamps? Hmm."
27032269768,At least one party is willing to make cuts.
27032269913,"Yep, piss off the poor, young people. Always worked out in the past right?"
27032272407,"Its a pretty short sited idea. The fact of the matter is that like it or not, nutrition is tied to public health. Malnourished people will cost out government money now that weve increased our healthcare spending. The last thing this nation needs is more people in the hospital and cutting the food stamp program will assuredly accomplish that. No policy if perfect and Id be lying if I said I thought food stamps were the exception to that rule. Despite its imperfections, its a legitimate program aimed at combating the bitter reality that poverty creates for so many people. Its funny that the constitution mentions protecting the general welfare of our nation. Programs like this are created through that motivation and there are hundreds of other problems with our nations domestic and foreign policy making that could be reformed to save 9 billion dollars."
27032273036,take a good look at the face of evil.
27032273751,Good. Maybe use that money to teach responsible spending and basic econ. I cant tell you the number of times I have witnessed people using stamps and link cards and then whipping out a $20 for mountain dew and cigarettes. Maybe if they werent abusing the system so hard it wouldnt be in such bad shape
27032275989,"Congress has two institutions. if this passes the senate and is signed by the Holy One I think you better start spreading the blame around. this is how you get fooled, you blame one party while the other fucks you and asks for votes. Just because one party didnt have as many votes doesnt mean they didnt have any and are free from blame. Here is a key phrase for those of you without any objectivity: **Both the Senate and President Barack Obama are expected to approve the legislation.** and this president just got up in front of all of us and said quite the fucking opposite. The difference in this done deal is that the democrats wanted to cut it by $5 billion. Read that again and again you dolts... The democrats wanted to cut SNAP as well."

They shut down schools and gut the education system so only the rich have the opportunity to get good jobs. They want people to be dependent on their employers for health insurance. They want to get rid of unions and the minimum wage. They want wages to be so low that people cant even miss a few days pay, so workers will be afraid to complain when theyre mistreated or underpaid. They want unemployment to be so high that any employee is instantly replaceable. And theyre getting exactly what they want. This is the path America is on right now. "

You should buy desires such as that when you have excess money to spend, not with taxpayers dollars."

But my opinion is that the government legislating ways companies to be fair is the wrong way to do it. We are subsidizing the poorest with food, off work pay, minimum hourly pay, healthcare and much more. I dont think that this stimulates anyone to grow. It is my opinion that it stagnates classes rather than creates safety nets. When Im working class and benifits appear, my cost of living goes up, and my company benifits disappear.

27032333084,Prepare for thousands starving in the streets of America!
27032333430,Thank god hopefully this gets lazy people off their ass and to work instead of bumming off my paycheck.
27032334163,"And how many of said people living in poverty somehow have the money for the latest smart phones which I cant even afford, or support their ongoing drug habits? Im not categorizing them all together, but people need a motivator for success. Enough with the handouts."
27032337361,You should blame the democrats as well since they did nothing to stop this or even put up a fight. 
27032338759,"We are told not feed the animals in National parks, because the animals will become dependent on handouts and will not be capable of taking care of themselves Same goes for humans, lets try giving the poor a hand up and not a handout. "

27032345305,"Hey, better than the 50 bil they proposed to cut. Silver lining of a shit situation. "
27032346626,"I wont say if Im Republic or Democrat, but has social programs like food stamps decreased the poverty line? Im saying that as a question, not a statement. Should the government be donating to private charities instead of social programs? It could be said that the Republics are trying to reduce govt debt, which is getting pretty big...idk. I just dont think that they are solely doing this to force people to get shitty jobs at corporations which are owned by the people who vote Republican. Not every republican voter is a rich ceo. Most of their votes are from Middle America. Last time I checked, there were more rich guys in California and NY (democrat states) than Louisiana and Alabama (repub states)"

27032358804,Whats especially sickening is that many of these Republicans claim to be Christians. Letting people starve is the opposite of Christianity.
27032361716,My family was poor and never on food stamps and it sure was a great motivator.
27032362790,This is an extremely lower number than what they wanted. IIRC they wanted 80 billion. This is not a bad deal. Compromise. Were a democracy.

27032364419,"My girlfriend works with refugees and I can see this as being a huge blow to them. A lot of them get jobs through IRC and organizations like this, but often theyre the jobs that no one else wants like dish washing. They dont pay well so many families rely on food stamps to help feed their families. This isnt just a problem that affects the poor. I think Its going to have a huge ripple effect. "
27032366104,&gt;a record number As a percentage of population or as a whole number? &gt;poverty Thats not a very descriptive word. What is poverty? How has its definition changed over time?
27032367676,AWESOME!!!!! Its about time the government stops handing out food stamps to people who do not need them
27032368138,"Im all for helping those who need it. But far too many times, Ive been waiting in line at the checkout and the person in front of me is using food stamps to purchase top of the line food items. And then buying beer, cigarettes and lotto with cash. It infuriates me because Im buying store brand shit and forgoing things I want so that I can afford the things I need. I live in NYC."
27032370655,I dont understand. How are so many people unemployed and living in poverty when Obamas stimulus bill was passed?
27032370836,Theres always money for wars though...
27032372417,Stealing to give to the poor isnt compassion. If there is a need it willbe filled voluntarily by actors in the marketplace. 
27032373731,Looks like Ill have to start eating the rich. Ill just sharpening my knife if anyone needs me...
27032375466,"Im of the opinion that anyone on any sort of federal welfare program should be required to submit a list of everything they are purchasing with their welfare. And if anything is out-of-line, kick them off welfare. "

27032377452,poor people do not contribute to Republican politicians.... screw them!
27032377998,"FUUUUUUUUUUUUCKERS!!!! And hey, I just spent $125 on groceries with cash because I have plenty of money but to think there are little kids and old people that dont have enough to eat it breaks my heart... "
27032378228,Ridiculous...pathetic...sad.
27032390898,When people starve rebellion follows. 
27032398833,And farmers that create minimum wage jobs for illegals got their guaranty that they will make a profit no matter what so they can export their crops to other nations. I wonder why the same people that were worried by the US bailing out GM have no problem supporting farming corporations by guarantying them a profit/loans? 
27032401122,"Wait a minute now, I was told last night that the economic recovery is full speed ahead, and the economy is in better shape now than it has been in a long, long time. Was that not true? I guess what Im saying is that according to the President, the cut in SNAP spending is warranted, right?"
27032404375,but if we went to war in syria no number would be too high
27032406215,Republicans should be thrown out of office by wide margins this November. And I dont see them retaking the White House for at least 30 years. Couldnt happen to a more deserving bunch of assholes.
27032408192,They only live in poverty because they choose to do so! When I was poor I was working three jobs and never took one fucking food stamp! I went to school I got a fucking job and I worked my ass off and not one fucking food stamp! Im one Democrat who thinks we have made a society lazy and uncommitted in to becoming better by giving people a hand out. We make black neighborhoods around the nation because we dont put jobs where they are. Food stamps s/b for old people or single mothers not fucking young punks who are trying to skim the system. So get off your fucking high horse Mother Jones and find these people fucking jobs! 
27032412507,"I hate how this says republicans, BOTH sides wanted to make massive cuts to food stamps."
27032415613,Correction: There is a record number of Americans who think goverment aid programs are actual income they are earning.
27032421739,"Thats pure evil. Keep slashing these programs, people will start dying of starvation - and crime will go way up from people looking to survive on money they can steal. Nothing good is going to come out of this. "

27032426402,"Republicans further ruining the US and antagonizing the poor, making them hopefully angry. Sometimes I think US republicans are actually paid by foreign governments because they fuck up everything seemingly deliberately.

27032435243,"My grandfather was known for doing crazy shit like Im 90 years old and the light company has gotten enough money from me. Then hed refuse to pay his bills. Every once in awhile it was The government is keeping the price of food too high and that aint right. I will not pay for oatmeal for the next six months because damn those agriculture cocksuckers all to hell. And then he would steal the food for that length of time. Once he decided hed been overpaying on all groceries so he went to the store, loaded his cart with the amount he felt owed and walked out. That made them even, see. Im not suggesting that we should launch some sort of mass civil disobedience food theft program, just wishing he was around so I could call him and say damn those Washington bastards."
27032436745,30 years of right wing reagaonomics fuked america up
27032437227,Good. Cut it all. And redesign a new program where you can only buy ESSENTIAL FOODS!
27032437255,fuck the poors i want white america and reagan back /s
27032437589,"Well, I guess I should move away. Maybe Canada. "
27032437875,As a cashier at a grocery store I can say that many of the things Ive seen food stamps spent on are wasteful and unnecessary. Not saying to get rid of the program but I would like to see more regulation. 
27032438615,Poor people should vote.
27032440976,"I hate to bring up actual facts in this group think, but all they did was cut 1% from the program, and ONLY by fraud enforcement. With few exceptions I outline below, no one is being cut from the program and no benefits are being cut. The only people cut from the program are murderers and rapists, and only those convicted AFTER the bill passes. Dont worry, youre still paying for murderers and rapists food stamps if they were convicted earlier."
27032441478,"Good. You think these people spend it on things they need? Hell no, they spend it on candy bars, soda, and junk food. Id rather see the whole program abolished. That, or much more heavily regulated. FOOD should be on there, not candy bars and junk."
27032441490,"So.....$9,000,000,000 divided by 45,000,000 people on food stamps, is $200/year or $16.67/month cut per person. Thats really not bad at all. But overall, it saved a ton. "
27032441980,Nice! This is great next step in ensure a revolt. 
27032443991,"So... both sides agreed the $9B loophole needed to be cut. Republicans wanted to save that waste, Democrats wanted to put that waste back into the system, essentially adding funding to an ovrrfunded program. I usually vote D or I, but Ive gotta go with the Repubs on this one. Waste needs to be cut anywhere we can cut it. "
27032448104,About damn time.
27032449145,as if the elephants vs asses is a legitimate squabble. 
27032449662,fuck
27032450265,And suddenly people cant get candybars with it anymore. Oh how I wish.
27032454366,I think its about time we make a list of addresses for all these guys and post it everywhere. 
27032455533,Just got done watching Grave of the Fireflies and then I see this when I open reddit. All I can think about is hungry kids.
27032456912,maybe such a generous food stamp program is a contributer to the record numbers in poverty?
27032458283,"I gotta hand it to the conservatives in this thread: Youve done a magnificent job of pretending that its not primarily Republicans who are in favor of slashing food stamps, and that Democrats are equally to blame. The ability of the American right wing to bullshit people never ceases to amaze me. And the sad thing is that most liberals and Democrats are poorly equipped to deal with your constant flood of misinformation. Conservatives tend to take their ideology very seriously, and learn to master all the lies and tricks. Liberals tend to be much more casual; politics isnt the central focus of their lives. As a result, they are very easy to lie to. Liberals tend to be trusting and have faith in others, so when you lie right to their faces, they are strongly inclined to believe you and agree with you. This is a nice quality to have in a human being, but it explains why liberals are always having the lunch eaten by conservatives. "
27032460444,"Hate to say it, but there is so much fraud and abuse in food stamps from my personal view. Of course it helps many also...but it seems like people treat it like free money...as if it doesnt have a cost to the tax payer. Id much rather pay in food stamps than cash (welfare)."
27032462087,"Sometimes tough decisions have to be made. Cant just keep giving handouts. For every 1 person who uses their foodstamps appropriately, theres 9 who dont. Too many lazy drug and alcohol addicts in this country. Ive been homeless, Ive been on foodstamps, im all for govt assistance if its used appropriately. But its not, and hardly ever is. Maybe im too harsh, I guess Im biased. I watched people get cash assistance only because they had children. Children they had no business having and children they dont take care of. I watched people buy alcohol when they shouldve been buying things that are actually necessary. Then you have me, only thing the govt could offer me were foodstamps. I declined. I was pissed off, and still am, about how little the govt cares about people without children. Thankfully I was smart enough to walk the same stretch every single day and over time the residents on that stretch would get used to seeing me. I would offer to do any odd job for very little pay or for food. That lead to someone letting me shower at their house/apt. Also later lead me to my current job that got me off the streets. Abuse of the system has gone on for too long. Im glad someone has the guts to make these type of tough decisions. "
27032463125,Eugenics is alive and well.
27032464257,Hurray! We took away food from our starving people! *High Fives all around*
27032467608,"And there are millions of sheep who will still remain poor and vote GOP because of a few hot-button religious issues. Oh, the humanity..."
27032468912,Are they engineering a revolt?
27032472562,Im glad to see this occur. Im only disappointed there was no structural reductions and only a loop hole being closed. But closing a loophole is a good day in government. Now only a few million more to go.
27032477536,"Good, maybe thatll cut the obesity rates too. You know America is the only country where even the homeless are still fat?"
27032477912, THE DEMS CONTROL THE SENATE. THEREFORE BOTH DEMS AND GOP WANT CUTS IN FOOD STAMPS. QUIT BLAMING THE GOP WHEN IT IS BOTH DEMS AND GOP
27032480907,wonder if those affected will vote in the next mid term election lets flush out the old bs and get some good ones in there
27032480947,"Perhaps now the unemployed, lazy people; dependent on government handouts, will get a job. Pay their way. And help stimulate the U.S. economy from within! :D"
27032481958,"not to mention its already down to $189/month at least that is if your applying as an individual in TN; so yeah, Im gonna buy myself all sorts of steaks and crab legs with my $6.30/day."
27032484151,"I dont understand why everyone is complaining. You all know NOTHING is going to change. The poor will get poorer, the middle class will become poor, homelessness will rise. The rich will get richer. It will never change because nobody is willing to do what it takes to change it. The people in charge are making too much money to want to change it. Companies have a legion of willing slaves to work for them, for next to nothing. I dont know why I even bother anymore, nothing is going to get better. At least not in our lifetimes it wont."
27032490555,"I think this is the change required to raise the minimum wage. What with the big corporations accounting for $7bn in food stamps. If this goes on, I see a French Revolution-esque rebellion coming. Storming of the Bastille soon? "
27032495483,I wonder what 9 Billion in military cuts would look like....
27032497043,"Welp, there goes the non-violent crime rates. "

27032506693,Just what I wanted to hear tonight when I already cant afford to fucking live.
27032508724,Damn those republicans are good at endearing themselves to the general public.
27032510007,Obama sure gives a lot of lip service to sticking up for the little guy but will he veto this?
27032514829,My food stamps went from a little over 200 to 189 which I believe is the new maximum for an individual. Right now this is all I have to eat...Im sure I could budget better but its gotten harder to make this stretch and the cut really didnt help that situation out When your hungry or worried about where the next meal is going to come from or keeping a roof over your head its really hard to concentrate on much else....I used to believe in the pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality but the whole system is stacked against that ...if your single and childless society doesnt care if you become homeless ...you become disposable and once you are homeless it becomes that much harder to climb back up I find myself trying to visualize what that would be like and its absolutely terrifying...so while I wouldnt of said this a few years ago I cant see how we can afford not to keep people at least fed know a basic sense ....and how do homeless people serve the interests of anyone? My saddest moments come when I realize that there is no help to stop that situation and sometimes I feel like its inevitable Fuck them for the cuts that brought it down to its current level even if these new cuts thankfully wont effect me 
27032515636,Theres an election coming up; **vote**. Study up on all the candidates and cast an informed vote for every office thats up for election.
27032517693,So for reference: a couple 12 packs of soda less per month. 
27032519798,Good. We cant afford it anyway.
27032521250,"Just reading through this thread, and... Do yall really view socialism as a viable option? It boggles my mind how anyone thinks an extreme approach is the answer. [cue the down votes]"
27032523042,Everyone knows that food stamps are abused by people who could definitely live without them. A lot of government programs are. Cutting this budget is hopefully signs that the screening to get them will be stricter. That way this 9 billion can go towards things the country really needs instead of giving people their food budget money so they can buy an Xbox One instead of budgeting and saving. Give an inch take a mile... 
27032527154,"I used to work in a grocery store in New York and I seen so many people frequently abuse the system to buy things such as: steak, crab, lobster, etc. (things people trying to save money do not buy so liberally). Those instances of abuse are what ruin programs like this for the many - its sad."
27032528533,"OK, only 1500 more cuts like this to solve our debt"
27032533784,Do you know how many people exploit the food stamp system? Cmon people...
27032534215,"The GOP wanted cuts, they got cuts. They really dont care that poor Americans will suffer, they just wanted cuts. On the positive side, farm subsidies were finally cut. Not as much as they should have been, but cut nonetheless."
27032534235,"Heres my point: Before you even begin bashing one another, first find out what really Farm Bill is.....I mean really spend sometime before you make a judgement... Food Stamp is a big part of Farm Bill.......now investigate why its even called Farm Bill.... Now if you commenting after reading....ehow, Wikipedia, how stuff works, worthless media, or just by making up your mind by the first page of what Google shows you.....you probably should think twice before posting.......unless your entire goal is all about copying and posting... Be an informed citizen........ research what them fuck is Farm Bill, which Congress recently passed is all about!! "
27032535143,"Fuck, man. Fuckin assholes. Its like they think poor people are just some made up bullshit and poverty doesnt really exist."
27032540535,"I have a friend whose family is rich, they own like many houses that are already paid off and rent out to other people for even more money. His parents are Republican and forces him to vote on issues like this. His sister got pregnant and decided to list herself as independent so that she could get food stamps. Yep. I have never shaken my head so fast in disappointments. "
27032555565,"As harsh as this sounds, THANK GOD!!! Imagine all the people they just motivated to educate themselves and get out and vote for interests of the common man. "
27032556922,I really dont want to see starving people in the streets but in 20 years it might not be a big deal for someone to die of starvation on our streets.
27032557640,"I dont think they understand what they are doing. People will become more and more desperate. BEST CASE that could happen is the crime rate will increase. WORSE CASE, riots and something similar to the french revolution. "
27032563526,"The whole program is epicly retarded and out dated. Buy up all the excess food and instead of using it to feed the hungry we tax people and then give them the money. The the US sells all the excess food such as corn and soy for filler and artificial crap. The whole thing needs t o be reworked, a farm bill to actually do something productive with the farms and a social welfare program around feeding the poor, the two no longer should be tied. "
27032567537,"I find it kinda messed up to have Rs wanting to cut social services, and then oppose any kind of minimum wage increase that would get those people off said social services. I honestly wonder if some of them wont be happy until people are starving and dying on the streets. "
27032570174,"I predict crime is going to be on the rise... UNLESS the new minimum wage laws tread in to effect... or is that just a helpfull suggestion? I base this on the fact that people will be losing a required monthly resources. Some people who receive foodstamps already have jobs, but cannot sustain their families on the minimum wage alone. So lets remove the foodstamps... and not cultivate some labour union movement or legislate minimum wage laws... chances are people will have to find other ways to supplament those loses in income (like GETTING ANOTHER JOB! YES! Thats the moxie! I have 2 underpaid jobs already, why not a 3rd one? Thatll solve the problem! YEEEEEEEY DEMOCRACY!) "
27032570383,It will still be double what it was back in 08 when Obama went to work fixing the economy.. Are these even truly cuts or just a decrease in the amount they were planning on increasing the budget? The SNAP annual summary may be one of the largest indicators of how much worse the economy has become under Obama. The number of people on food stamps has risen from 28 million in 2008 to 47 million in 2013. 
27032571087,"Yeah poverty. I know many people who are able to get a job, but dont because its easier to live off of the government."
27032573589,This is great news!
27032575377,So are they trying to piss people off enough to start a revolution? 
27032577264,Baggerz will get what the deserve come election day.
27032579466,Yet nobody wants an increase in taxes for the rich....
27032581103,I needed food stamps for a period of six months in my life. I wouldnt have done it were it not for my kids. It was not glamorous and every day I struggled to get a job and get off them. These people will NEVER understand what they are doing. Its like trying to explain an MMO to a goldfish.

27032592976,I volunteered to do a Americorps program for a year. Food stamps was a 1/5 of our monthly wage. 20% of anything makes a difference.

27032595734,"Its not the federal governments job to feed the people of this nation. Their purpose is to govern not provide. You need food, fell on hard times? Look to your community, local churches, friends, family. Yeah, thats right, its called local community. You should try it some time. "

27032605395,Let them eat cake!
27032608076,"One old guy I know ran into an eager beaver social worker who got him food stamps, an Obamaphone, and a Ukrainian housekeeper. He laughed his ass off, since he already gets subsidized housing, free transportation, free medical, free hot meal for lunch, etc., mostly from ex-Chicago mayor Richard Daleys vote buying programs for elders (who vote). While he lives on only about $700/month on Social Security, almost all of that is mad money since almost all his expenses are paid by other government programs. Thus he finds it hilarious that he gets food stamps, Obamaphone, and a housekeeper; and being old he repeats this hilarity every time I see him. Almost all government giveaways are rife with fraud and waste, so $9 billion is probably a fraction of what should be cut. Never doubt that we will have to pay the piper eventually from the Democrats bankrupting the country. "
27032613072,For all of those who arent quote sure on where they stand politically - Libs (most everyone on r/politics) are beta phaggots who blame everyone/everything in the world for their problems except for themselves.

Its weird but I didnt want to be lumped into that crowd. So when it was up I decided not to renew. What I saw there wasnt starving masses huddling for food. I saw people who just honestly wanted a free hand. I heard a woman gloating about how much she was able to exploit out of the system. They would go there with all their kids, letting them run all over the place wrecking stuff. One kid unraveled all the toilet paper in the mens room for one roll. There was still some left, but it was a mess. After witnessing that I dont mind the cuts. There was nobody there that seems actually down on their luck. They just wanted free stuff."

27032685425,"Why? Seriously why? Republicans justify this by claiming theyre helping to reduce the deficit, and its the biggest load of bullshit Ive ever heard. Anyone who has taken a basic macro economics class can justify otherwise. We need to cut welfare. No, you need to cut social security, because its the biggest chunk of the budget and its not sustainable with an aging baby boomer population. SNAP is a drop in the bucket. I do not understand the right-wing obsession with begrudging everyone that is poor. They think that all poor people are lazy, needle-using moochers who put themselves in the position they are in. Being poor is your fault! The republicans ingenious solution to paying off debt is metaphorically like trying to find as many pennies under the couch cushions as possible, and completely ignoring the $300K mercedes in the driveway that put you in debt to begin with.

I think attitude is the biggest thing that you have to focus on. I got out of the military with no savings and some debt. Got married and almost immediately my wife and I found we were going to have a baby. Nothing focuses your attention like that. I work 50 hours a week, I go to school full time, and my wife coupons like a mad woman. I consider myself on the very low side of middle class right now, but we live pretty well, and my wife watches every penny. What we found, is that by focusing, and paying attention to where everything goes, you can make ends meet. Couponing isnt glamorous, but its incredible to watch a 150 dollar grocery bill shrink down to 30 bucks or so. Im not saying that there arent people out there who can use a hand up, but in my opinion, people just dont focus enough on improving their lives. I would rather have government programs go to education benefits, training programs so people can escape dead-end jobs, and to financial planning classes which will teach people how to be smart with their money. I know people who drive nice cars they cant afford, paying interest thats sky high because they dont make enough to finance a good rate, and who have no problem paying for things they dont need with plastic, who suddenly realize they need some help.

27032703133,"The article said... &gt;Both the Senate and President Barack Obama are expected to approve the legislation. and this... &gt;This is the first time in history that a Democratic Senate has even proposed cutting the program. Now the upper chamber is expected to pass cuts twice the level it approved last year. and this... &gt;But Dems deserve much of the blame, the Democratic aide says. and this... &gt;One hundred three Democrats voted against the farm bill, but 89 voted in favor. and this... &gt;Democrats in the House and Senate agreed to cut nutrition aid for poor Americans because they have shifted to the right on SNAP politically, the staffer adds. Oh, please. Mother Jones said all of this directly in the article, yet it chose to craft headline to exclusively blame Republicans? They make me sick. This article is just worthless. Heres the best part. The 9 bill dollars isnt a straight cut to poor peoples food stamps. This is ALSO directly from the article... &gt;The cuts to the food stamp program come from closing a loophole that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreed needed to be addressed. A households level of monthly food stamps benefits is determined by how much disposable income a family has after rent, utilities, and other expenses are deducted. Some states allow beneficiaries to deduct a standard utility charge from their income if they qualify for a federal heating aid program called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, even if they only receive a few dollars per year in heating aid. The arrangement results in about 850,000 households getting a utility deduction that is much larger than their actual utility bill. Because the deduction makes these families disposable income appear to be lower than it actually is, they get more food stamp money each month. The farm bill that passed the House on Wednesday saves $9 billion by closing that loophole. So, a loophole was allowing people to essentially lie and claim their income to be lower than it really is. All the 9 billion cut does is close that loophole. Seriously, read the article next time before revvin up the false outrage. So, since the loophole being closed was allowing people to lie about their income and exploit the system, and Democrats voted to block fixing it, I guess all Im supposed to take away from this is that Democrats support exploitation and dishonesty. Well, if thats the case, Ill have some of Jon Stewarts farm with a bit of honey mustard."

I am not saying that it is the only cause and Im not saying he is the only to blame but to ignore the effects of his presidency when this site has put ALL economic blames on this last presidency is completely hypocritical. So now, we have a higher unemployment rate and we have more people who have stopped looking for a job than who are. We have spent trillions on the war on poverty since LBJ and literally nothing has gotten better. There are more poor now as a % of the population than there was when it was declared. The ONLY effect the war on poverty has is to buy the poor vote for democrats. With that said, it is mind boggling when all welfare programs has utterly failed, we contain down the same path. Every time the argument is said, they fail because its not enough! and welfare is increased, the poor do not decrease and they arent all of a sudden better off.

His only sources are citing how many people have enrolled, and how they enrolled. They mention NOTHING about how many people have lost insurance and have been unable to regain it through the exchange. But at least that scumbag is backing down from his original 80 million people will lose the insurance. Heres another source or two: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/19/insurance-cancellations-fewer-than-500000/4132959/ http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/01/03/fact-check-employer-health-plans/4307135/ Edit: sources"
27070750327,"So, can I take it this is you admitting your 5 million people figure was full of shit? It seems that way, since you didnt acknowledge the issue. But since this has turned into a source bash, why would you ever cite a magazine catering to corporate pigs everywhere? Its just that type of greedy special interest that has fucked what we knew of as our democracy. Good luck buddy."
27069731651,"So you counteract Forbes with USA Today, a died in the wool liberally biased organization that uses guestimations instead of facts. Your first article is an opinion piece with no factual support. The second one is at least from FactCheck.org (another liberally slanted organization, but at least better than USA Today) and acknowledges that people will lose their healthcare but doesnt come up with a number because it admits it doesnt have one. So you are a stooge to the liberally biased media, and more importantly to the Administration. Its obvious from your reply that you havent read the article, merely skimmed it, saw a sentence that fit your narrative and moved on. USA Today is a paper that supported President Obama in both of his elections and backed his If you like it, you keep it statement that even he acknowledged was false. What more do you people need? The administration is full of shit (like most administrations) and the bill is broken and badly needs a rewrite. WAKE. THE. FUCK. UP. Have a lovely day. "

27151430287,"Its frustrating that Republican defenders have such poor reading comprehensive and critical thinking skills. Pointing out that Obama lies, but does so less than the (Republican-offered alternatives) isnt an excuse. Its well supported by, for example, Mitt Romneys record during the last campaign; a stunning [533 Mitt Romney Lies!](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2012/08/29/mitt-romney-tells-533-lies-in-30-weeks-steve-benen-documents-them/) Politifact Ratings (Mostly False or Lower) * [Barack Obama](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/) 26% * [Mitt Romney](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mitt-romney/) 41% To go back a bit further, Obamas lies are in-arguably less awful than the Bush lies that cost us two trillion dollars, and the lives of 100,000+ people. Finally, you also told me to Call a spade a spade, call a liar a liar. Thats an odd thing to say in response to my comment, He did lie about this and other things. In other words, I called a liar, a liar. "
27151474189,Call a spade a spade was admittedly not the best analogy. My point was that it is unnecessary and counterproductive to point the finger back at Republicans every time Obama lies or screws up.
27151462239,We are. Saying he was the least shitty option IS calling a spade a spade. There was no less shitty option than Obama. At least not any any ballot that Oklahomans will see.
27151372683,"Why do you have to make that excuse? Every time he does something terrible the chorus of But Better Than A Republican comes in to soften the situation up for their guy. Its partisan and unproductive. Call a spade a spade, call a liar a liar. "
27151470599,"Your entire response confirms exactly what Im talking about. You spent nearly the entire post demonstrating how much more Republicans lie than Democrats...who is that news to? Im not a Republican defender and Ill call them on their crap every time, including the entire Bush train wreck. You of course assumed Im conservative just because Im critical of Obama, the exact kind of partisan bullshit Im talking about. Youve certainly got me on semantics, though. Congratulations. Pointing the finger at Republicans every time an Obama lie is mentioned isnt by definition an excuse but its a distraction and serves no purpose other than to create camps of us vs them and soften criticism of the liar who is the topic of discussion. Im sure you also understood my intent behind the call a spade a spade comment (call a spade a spade without having to remind everyone about the shitty diamond), but again chose to piddle around with semantics.

26913106672,"They modeled ObamaCare after the jet program, only more waste, and failure rate even higher. So your beloved program sucks even worse. How about we get the government out of all of it."
26914743323,"Good liberal response, never answered my question of how to get the government out of it. They cant run a lemonade stand, much less this. They would have had injected far less trauma if they had just included all these poor democratic voters with no health insurance in Medicaid, and left the rest alone. Thats where those are going anyway, but along with it are 93 million others who had insurance, now being cancelled all because of ObamaCare. Not to mention hundreds of thousands getting their work hours cut back from full time to 29 hours, all because of ObamaCare. Looking forwards to seeing the results of 2014 elections. And all the hoopla with Obama refusing to delay the individual mandate, and accepting the government shutdown to protect it, bullshit, he wants to delay it. Like everything thing else out of his mouth.................a big LIE!"

I dont have a problem with anybody owning a gun, I own one myself since Im a pussy and could never defend my family or myself with my hands. But when you take them out in public and display them during supposedly peaceful protests, you are accomplishing nothing but scaring those around you. If you fire shots in anger, you automatically forfeit your freedom and hopefully your life."
27139264850,"That is a retarded comeback, nothing I said came from FOX, but first line of liberal retort is claiming someone is a parrot for FOX.

27137479853,"And my guess is you are one of those that gets off on the government taking away peoples freedom by using force. And yes, the government could have prevailed, but the cat was out of the bag on Harry Reid and his son throwing Bundy off the land his family had been using for decades, just so they could make more corrupt deals by subverting the force of the government for themselves. yep, its those despicable teabaggers getting in your way."

27108335108,"I voted for him too, and I dont regret it unlike plenty of others who voted him into office. The way I see it, Obama has really opened my eyes to the current state of our politics. The first black president, Change, and all these other phrases that tricked us into believing that this president would be different. This president has shown me the current state of our political system. It doesnt matter how different any given candidate may be, the citizens are going to get screwed either way. The face of who is fucking us may change, but the fact still stands that we are getting royally fucked by whoever is in charge. "
27108456135,"i dunno, is it better to vote for the guy who can talk about the right things and maybe do them sometimes, or the guy who says all the wrong things and hope he accidentally does the right thing sometimes?"

27108264719,"I dont blame the people that voted for him the first time around, but the second time it blows my mind that people hadnt caught on to his constant lies. This is NOT saying mitt Romney should have won, just that Im amazed how many people still supported Obama after his first term. "

27108266963,"The Dems were always going to run him again no matter what, and nobody wanted to vote for a spoiler and as a consequence end up with Romney. Everybody was over a barrel. I have a really hard time believing that Romney even actually had all of the support that he supposedly had. After all of the Snowden revelations, what we know about Diebold, the tampering allegations in 2000 and 2004... I dont really have much faith in the election process at large anymore. Who knows whats fabricated and whats not."
27108519824,But come on. Remember who our alternatives were. 
27108248351,"I voted for Obama once, when he ran for the Illinois Senate. Once I realized he was all talk and charisma, I never voted for him again. He unfortunately did very little as Senator of Illinois, except launch his Presidential campaign. Im not saying that Romney would be doing a better job. I didnt vote for him, either. Lets just say Im very much looking forward to 2016. Ive had enough of Obamas ineffective leadership. "
27108447917,"I never felt worse voting than voting for that fucker a second time, knowing it was him or Romney I chose the evil i already knew would lie to and disappoint me. "
27108281127,"Dont feel bad. Its not like your vote would have changed anything, anyway."
27108235944,"Yep, that was vomit worthy. EDIT - LOL at the cascade of downvotes on this."
27108252715,"With all of the Congressional gerrymandering, I think were in for a looooooooong, bad ride. :( Even without it, the Dem party has been slowly morphing into Reagan-lite for years.

27108488096,"The really scary thing is that as much of a disappointment as hes turned out to be (I voted for him as well), Im still pretty sure he was the lesser of two evils."
27108708772,"I think most of us that voted for him, really just were more scared of the alternative: Mittens and John Sara Palin McCain."

27108514175,"I think its pretty standard for any President who can give a decent speech. Its part that saying things is easer than doing things, part that not everything is in the Presidents control no matter what he may say, and part that speeches can, and have been, given simply to pacify people without an action following.

27108428347,Just like the old joke. how can you tell a politician is lying?
27108491450,"Eh, better than the other guy."
27108515131,I feel ya. I still hold out that it was better than the alternative.
27108427192,"And thank god you did. Regardless of the fact that his presidency was 75% lies, at least when I graduate I may have a job. Cant say McCain or Romney wouldnt have fucked us more."
27108861921,"I was instantly turned off from the article when he said &gt;That¡¯s when I fully internalized that many Democrats literally had no actual political beliefs other than we support Obama in everything that he does, even when he takes precisely opposite positions in a three week period Now, please note - I think Greenwald is a superb journalist (for the most part). But I think this was a bit much. I know PLENTY of democrats, especially those who are actually progressive rather than the left that has been created by a huge vacuum of sanity by the right that shifted the spectrum and skewed things. I think hes done a lot of great things - I think the healthcare reform should have gone further, but I accept that he could only get so much done given that he didnt *really* have a super majority. However, this whole NSA thing? While there are things I still support him "
27108233784,"And lets not forget, though, that over the summer what he was saying was that we would have arrived at these reforms and conclusions about spying on Americans *without* Snowden. The President was *just about to get there!!!* That pesky kid foiled the big surprise! One of the biggest lies ever told in his Presidency, right up there with going on Leno and saying there was no domestic spying program at all."
27108228025,"Obama has really honed it into an art form, though. Bastard can sure TALK. And I voted for the guy. "
27108239101,"He campaigned on an awful lot, very little of which got any more than lip service. The ACA is a marginal improvement, but mostly a big sloppy love letter to insurers. Its disappointing to watch supposedly left-leaning pundits try so hard to sell it. I do think that a mandate is inevitable, but so much about the program is just fucked in a misguided and cynical attempt to preserve the insurance industry and prevent a shake-up in medical supply pricing strategies (which are all totally fucked and NEED a shake up.) Thered be a lot of fallout from establishing universal healthcare in the US because of the layers and layers of job-creating and pocket-stuffing bureaucracy that currently exist, but its the ONLY real solution."
27108973989,and yet youre still better off than with the other guy :(
27109001646,&gt; And I voted for the guy. He was better than the alternative. Thats about the only positive thing you can say.
27108232473,I cant say hed be much worse but I dont think hed be a lot better. Congress is the real issue anyway.

27108305999,"Uh isnt this what all politicians have to do? Isnt this more a culture of our political system and 24 hour news that will slam everything and blow small things out of proportion for ratings. Has made politicians afraid to enact any changes. Case in point the heat Obama is taking for trying to fix a health care system that everyone agrees is broken, corrupt, and overcharging us for everything."
27108314891,I challenge the people of reddit to find me a single candid picture of the president since he took office. The dude only appears for highly staged photo-ops. 
27108348024,"Hes either the biggest sociopath ever born, or hes a puppet with a gun to the back of his neck. Maybe both."
27108342354,"It blows me away everyday that I bought everything this guy said, hook, line and sinker, and it honestly seems like he could not do any of the things he said he would do. He either really believed he could do what he promised but couldnt get our incompetent Congress to make any real legislative decisions. Or hes just a puppet for the aforementioned incompetent Congress and the corporations that have spent millions on them. Either way, the American people have most definitely lost."

27108443734,"Maybe its just me, but how couldnt anybody spot that hes just that... a voice? Him and Romney both struck me as windbags. I didnt pay much attention to Obama or McCain during Obamas first go (I was too young to vote so I just wasnt interested), but do all Presidential candidates come across as nothing but talkers? "
27108468532,Voted for him in 2008. Felt molested and violated. Not in 2012.
27108608868,That is why I never vote for anyone. That way they can never do some things that I disagree with later.
27108610262,yeah he told me he would fight for healthcare and did nothing. he told me we with withdraw from iraq and did nothing. he told me he would give us a consumer finacial protectional agency and modify the rules to make it harder for the banks to screw us and did nothing come the fuck on dude.. yeah he is a fucking politician like all fucking politicians but dont pretend he hasnt done shit for us. YEAH HE FUCKS US WITH the whole NSA THING.. but you people who pretend he is all talk are part of the fucking problem. DO YOU REALLY THINK LIKE WOULD BE BETTER WITH PRESIDENT BOMB BOMB BOMB IRAN MCCAIN.. WHO THOUGHT IT WAS A WISE IDEA TO PICK PALIN? 
27108640271,"Voting for talk is *important*. It shows where the mandate is. Even if a politician fails to deliver, you shouldnt be upset that you voted for the *platform* that he promised. It sends a message that this is the platform you want. You should also vote for the platform you want next time. You should keep doing it. Politicians will *always* disappoint you. Its your job to sway where the mandate goes. Dont vote for people. Vote for platforms."
27108792991,"American politics are a bunch of popularity contests between the rich &amp; privileged. You didnt have much of a choice in the first place. Although, Obama was known to be for warrantless spying before his 2008 candidacy."

27108851109,"Oh yes. Bush was doing bullshit, but at least he was doing what he said! Obama says nice things and then does bullshit. But at least this should be the final lesson about how much one can trust a politician like him. Next time we need a real progressive candidate. Dont forget that people do not hate Obama for his left *promises* and *rethorics*, they elected him twice over those! The country is far far more left than the establishment thinks! They hate him because his actions are the polar opposite. "

27021718440,"The reason I dialed that back was that Id read that the consensus was that extending unemployment benefits in a depressed economy extended joblessness by a week or two so while it does extend joblessness the impact is very small.

Most of the time, you have plenty of time to shop around. "
26965518398,"Not having single payer, in other words, having a figurative gun to your head when you blindly accept treatment without being able to know what the procedure will cost, let alone have the time and security to shop around for the best price, it makes me think of that early Simpsons episode where Lisa is trying to buy a rare record to honor the memory of Bleeding Gums Murphy, and upon finding out the musician is deceased, Comic Book Guy immediately marks up the price of the record. Its pure insanity how were doing things. In 50 years people are going to look back and shiver at how we lived so dangerously, skirting financial ruin by just hoping were not slammed with a medical crisis."

27091491013,"Money goes from the corporations into the pockets of politicians who make the laws. Those corporations dont pay them unless they make the laws that benefit the corporations. The corporations are so big and have so much money, the politicians feel they cant win elections without these massive donations, so they acquiesce. Its legal, its awful, and its not democracy. Sorry to burst your bubble, but America is corrupt. "
27091485428,"How is this even legal in America? Brit here, and one big thing we learn about the US is that its supposed to have a legal environment that encourages competition, innovation and growth in business above all else - so how on earth can something like this be allowed? I know there are vested interests at play, but it just seems bizarre from this side of the pond that you could just ban a company from selling a perfectly legal product to people simply because other businesses are worried about losing customers. "
27091862556,"Im not saying i agree with it, because I do not, but the reason dealerships have superiority is because years ago people were worried that the large car companies would either overprice, not provide local service, or simply not care about all of its customers. So, to try to protect the consumer, politicians felt that dealerships would be able to provide good local service and actually care about their customers. However, as you can see, technology has changed and so should politics."

Campaign contributions come from multiple avenues, but where it counts the most, they come from corporations and rich businessmen like the Koch brothers. Those donations come at a cost. Its not outright bribery, but youll always notice the corporations puppets coming to their aid when they need it. See Governor Christie of New Jersey recently banning direct sales of Tesla cars. He got a lot of money from the states auto dealers to protect their interests. If Tesla had donated more than them, Tesla direct sales probably wouldnt have been banned. See the MPAA and the RIIA and their constant battle against the internet, file sharing, and streaming. Instead of adopting better business models and innovating (the supposed American Way), they used their puppets in the Government to block progress at every turn. See the Walt Disney Company profiting from public domain stories and then lobbying for stricter copyright laws to prevent other companies from following suit and competing with them. We need a Constitutional Amendment to get money out of politics, but what do you think the odds of getting that passed are at this point?"

Some states of no sales tax. Some have 10% sales tax. Its really a big complicated mess. I guess our reputation comes from a clear-eyed worship of the dollar over any other relationship.

My point is that its silly lazy and or dishonest to claim that 2014 already has a school shooting rate of one per 2 days. Third, the US has roughly the 18th highest gun violence rate per capita of all countries based on research done by politifact.com. My point here is not thats being 18th makes our numbers acceptable. My point is that you are making a strawman argument. Finally, this is my favorite one. Just like every other prohibitive law in the United States, the increase in the prohibitiveness of gun laws in the United States has a direct correlation to the amount of gun violence. Chicago is an excellent example of this. Restrictive gun laws will not help us. We must change the cultural attitude."

26746064131,"That chart is for **income** taxes. The super wealthy arent living on **income**, they are earning money from investments, dividends, loans against stock options, routing their shell corporation profits through offshore accounts, and so forth. The tax rate on those forms of money is much lower. Even Warren Buffet said he pays a lower rate that his secretary: http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/index.html Key quote from the article: The top marginal tax rate also rose for the wealthiest wage earners, but since Buffetts income is from investment gains, not wages, thats not a factor. &gt;The rich pay higher percentages than the poor. Only on **income**. When youre the CEO of some multinational and making a nominal $500K a year but also get $200 million on stock options, other money classified as carried interest or dividends and so forth, you **arent** paying **income** taxes on the bulk of that money. So you actually end up paying a much much lower percentage. For example, Mitt Romney: http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/21/pf/taxes/romney-tax-return/index.html He paid about 15% taxes. That doesnt sync up too well with your claims. "

Unfortunately, he was [lying](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/09/obamas-teacher-tax-whopper/). &gt;Only on **income** Nope. As Ive just explained, the CBO report includes all forms of compensation -- including capital gains. The rich still pay more. Much more. As for Mitt Romney, I dont care. I gave you overall statistics. Anecdotal evidence of a few outliers is irrelevant in a statistical discussion. "

This resolved the contradiction in voting for appropriations but not voting to fund them. The rule stood until it was repealed by Congress in 1995. Basically, if we voted to budget for items, we also voted to raise the debt ceiling to fund them, which made it so the U.S. couldnt potentially default on its debts. Then in 1995, the GOP eliminated the Gephardt rule, and then used the debt ceiling to shut down the government in 1996. "

26922157016,&gt;What a wonderful way to prove that the president was at the time given support as well as a temporary free ride. You mean Bill Clinton? Who was the president at the time he made those statements.
26922126954,"One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line. President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998 If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraqs weapons of mass destruction program. President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998 Iraq is a long way from USA but, what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face. Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998 He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983. Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998 We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.Constitution and Laws, to take necessary actions, (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs. Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998 Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998 Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies. Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999 There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue a pace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies. Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001 We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them. Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002 We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002 Iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power. Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002 We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction. Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002 The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons... Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002 I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security. Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002 There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002 He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002 In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002 We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002 Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating Americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real ...

27069264570,"well, one thing that did come out as true is that the CIA had live information of what was happening. This is important because the pentagon refused to send airborne support because they had no viable information such as who was leading it and such. If the CIA had just bothered to liaison with the pentagon the disaster might have been averted. "
27069769861,"oh yeah, i understand that completely. Just one of those frustrations that should be fixed but for institutional reasons never does get fixed. "
27069768369,"source for CIA in the city, though its not the best source in form of information.

27054392676,"Im not making any value statement. Just giving a couple numbers to obviously counter the 90% claim from above. That said, your first source to politifact is saying that many of the super rich live off investments and not necessarily income. While true, it still doesnt change the fact that the top 1% paid 37.4% of income taxes collected. &gt;This is disheartening considering that the 1% control roughly 35%[2] of the wealth. Without getting into my problems with that source and its methodology, going by their numbers they pay roughly the same percentage of the nations taxes as well. &gt;Lastly, the figure of 37.4% you stated is only income taxes, not all taxes like you state. I did say on income, although I suppose I could have worded it better."
27054305132,"That he did. On income, [the top 1% in 2012 paid 37.4% of all taxes, while the bottom 95% paid 40.9%.](http://www.aei-ideas.org/2012/12/top-1-of-american-taxpayers-pay-almost-as-much-in-taxes-as-bottom-95-and-half-of-that-group-paid-nothing-in-2010/) That does not, however, take into account capital gains taxes, which are a significant part of the tax burden on the 1%. Although I dont have numbers on that, it seems pretty obvious that the 1% would pay more capital gains taxes than the bottom 95%. So, the 1% already pays a massive share of the taxes collected."
27054368041,"True, the rich do pay more in capital gains taxes because they do have more investments. But you are forgetting some other important taxes such as payroll. Payroll taxes disproportionately affect the poor compared to the rich. With that in mind, it is estimated that the rich actually pay [less taxes](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/18/warren-buffett/warren-buffett-says-super-rich-pay-lower-taxes-oth/) as a percentage compared to the rest of the country. This is disheartening considering that the 1% control [roughly 35%](http://www.businessinsider.com/charts-on-us-inequality-2013-11?op=1) of the wealth. Lastly, the figure of 37.4% you stated is only income taxes, not *all* taxes like you state. Keep in mind that income snapshots of the top 1% dont really give the whole picture. The bottom of the 1% is made up of professionals such as lawyers and doctors. They are the ones that mostly make up the income tax figures on these sources. The upper portion of the 1% dont have normal jobs and dont really pay income taxes as compared to the wealth they bring in. "

[Lets look at the states](https://www.statescape.com/resources/partysplits/partysplits.aspx) and where they land economically.

(The [full report](http://alec.org/docs/RSPS-6th-Edition?utm_source=Main+alec+site&amp;utm_medium=RSPS+Download+page&amp;utm_campaign=RSPS+Download+calculator) is here.) Welfare expenditure is a pretty good indicator of how a states economy is performing, so well pick that. [Here is a list of states and the amount they spend per capita on Welfare](http://www.statemaster.com/graph/eco_wel_cas_tot_fam_percap-caseloads-total-families-per-capita).

Further, [when you look at welfare spending as a percentage of GDP](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/compare_state_spending_2014p40S) red states make up only 4 of the top 15.

[Looking at the numbers](http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm), Blue states only have 3 in the top 15, and have 8 in the bottom 15 (including the bottom 4, all at 8% or more). Gee, its funny how, the more you look at the numbers, the more you see red states continually beating out the blue states when you look at the numbers beyond the superficial and misleading surface. Still interested in reality? "
27124313815,"You present a strong argument good sir. I would think someone of your character would be above using words like liberal agenda. Its the political equivalent of yo mama. In regards to your first point, your claim that a good state for business equals a strong economy does not ring bells with me. A good state for business could also mean a good state for companies to take advantage of workers and dont have to pay equitable tax shares, or are more free of government regulations (such as environmental). You dont have to agree with me, just something for consideration. If I were to bring a new company into my city, I want a company with a strong union, high wages and benefits, contributes financially to the community in proportion to its rewards. I believe that is a stronger indicator of economic strength than how much profit a company can make. Which is really what good for business means, potential for profitability. Your second point, welfare is a good indicator of economic strength, may not be a universally accepted norm. [see here](http://www.unc.edu/~jdsteph/documents/common/chapters/WS%20&amp;%20Econ.pdf). Welfare rates as a measure of GDP or per capita has more to do with coverage levels, access, and local economies. Only one of those variables is directly correlated with a states economic strength. And I dont know what your personal stance on politicfact is, but there is this [analysis!](http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/28/occupy-democrats/pro-democrat-group-says-9-10-poorest-states-are-re/) Basically stating 9/10 red states are the most poor as a true statement. The person making the original statement is biased, but the data they pulled from is not. Now listen, I understand sources and data. Please understand that there are a plethora of sources citing data both ways. Please dont assume everyone that doesnt think like you or has accessed the same sources or put their faith in the same data as you as subscribing to a liberal agenda. You brought up some good points. But its not a matter of you being a bloody genius and your information is the holy be all of data and all conservative/republicans are great and all liberal/democrats are idiot sheep. Your red states are only economically stronger by the measures you chose to use and the data you chose to use. I chose a different set of data. "
27136452907,"&gt;you are being partisan as fuck. Please tell me what part of my comments were partisan. Did you even read that article? The Mostly False rating is based on Rushs comment that Sebelius was the sole decision maker and that she decided whether Sarah lived or died. Not that she had the ability to waive the policy. In fact, politifact stated that :Sebelius did have the power to overrule the age requirements of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network -- the entity that oversees transplants in the United States. The appeal was brought to Sebelius. She denied it. Then was forced to waive it under the ruling of a federal judge. &gt;Reality has a liberal bias Oh. Youre one of those people. I understand now."
27136411288,"&gt;...oh, so she didnt want the government to interfere and preferred to stay out of it? The transplant policy was put in place by the government with medical expert cooperation. Sebelius bowed to the policy that was put in place with their input. However, it is a government policy, so a government official intervening would not be the government interfering, but the government waiving a policy they put in place. Hence the reason Sarah needed to appeal to Sebelius to be put on the list. This wasnt a case of doctors saying no. It was a case of the doctors saying yes, but the government policy and Sebelius saying no. &gt;You really need to stop listening to partisan attacks and sharing their talking points. Excuse me? I didnt give you partisan talking points. I laid out the facts of the case you were asking for. Yes, the person who you replied to was rather hyperbolic in his framing of Sebelius, but the fact remains that she was a step in the girls appeal process to get on the transplant list, and Kathleen denied the appeal. Perhaps you should start looking into things for yourself instead of dismissing any information you dont like as partisan attacks. "

Edit: BTW you should look into the so-called Clinton surplus. There never was such a thing.
26832935905,"&gt;BTW you should look into the so-called Clinton surplus. There never was such a thing. [Yes, there definitely was.](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/) There are two common criticisms of the balanced-budget claim, the first is that the budget would not have been balanced if it werent for Social Security running a surplus in its separate budget; and the other is that the government uses an accounting scheme different from corporations. Neither of those actually affect the claim of a surplus (though they do affect the *amount*). &gt;&gt;But even if we remove Social Security from the equation, there was a surplus of $1.9 billion in fiscal 1999 and $86.4 billion in fiscal 2000. So any way you count it, the federal budget was balanced and the deficit was erased, if only for a while. [...] &gt;&gt;But even under accrual accounting, the annual reports showed surpluses of $69.2 billion in fiscal 1998, $76.9 billion in fiscal 1999, and $46 billion for fiscal year 2000. So even if the government had been using that form of accounting the deficit would have been erased for those three years."
26832966769,But the reason there appeared to be no deficit (or a surplus even) was because the government simply starting borrowing shit loads of money. The public debt did go down but the intra-governmental holdings went up. According to the US Treasury there was still a huge national debt.

So no, not everything will be paid back. http://www.businessinsider.com/sigtarp-tarp-lot-money-2012-4 Second, federal spending has gone down 2 years in a row, the fist time that has happened since the Korean War, and IIRC it is projected to go down again this FY. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/08/dennis-ross/rep-dennis-ross-says-us-spending-has-fallen-two-st/ Also, I find it funny you say no jobs. If thats the case, why do republicans/libertarians insist those on welfare are moochers and could get a job no problem if they werent so lazy? "
27149774111,"Like VelvetElvis said: it prevented another great depression. i.e. a soft rebound from the recession. Jobs back to pre-recession levels, moderate economic growth, and not massive job losses, catastrophic business failures and negative growth. It could have been much, much worse. It also could have been much better if the stimulus had been bigger with increased spending on education and infrastructure creating JOBS. But the GOP killed it, and hence the anemic growth out of the recession. "
27149710148,OOOOO k.....it was wasted and now we have a govt bloated to hell and ZERO growth and no jobs
27149934424,My god....you rubes will believe anything fed to you by leftotards Obama created this zombie bank hell while trampling individual freedoms left and right. There are no jobs.....all gains due to reduction of labor force participation rate and NO growth. Enjoy morons.
27046731210,Not all the GOPs problem here. Obama has publicly stated his unwillingness to negotiate on many things. Being able to appoint any judge he desires to rule anything he wants as consitutional is a huge danger to our society. No limit to what he can pass. Obama and Reid were the biggest critics of this when the repubs even discussed doing that. I wouldnt even want someone that shares my political views to have that kind of power.
27047178420,"&gt; Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and theyre sure trying to do so, its going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they cant and wont compromise. I know, Ive tried to deal with them. -- Barry Goldwater Unfortunately, the sentiment of compromise is lost on the current Republican party."

27046632271,"Why are you allergic to the truth? http://www.factcheck.org/2013/06/obamas-judicial-juggling/ Dems *DID NOT* come to an agreement. In some categories they treated Bushs nominees worse than Republicans are treating Obamas nominees. Youre simply ignoring the facts because they arent beneficial to your team. For example: &gt;Circuit Courts of Appeals: Obama¡¯s appeals court judges waited an average of 240.2 days between nomination and confirmation during his first term; Bush¡¯s waited an average of 277.0 days during his first term, the longest of any recent president."
27046386071,nice job responding is such a mature manner. lol 
27046302267,When it comes to stalling nominees the GOP has the worst track record as of late. The Dems came to an agreement with the Bush administration on a number of nominees while the Republicans spit on such ideas. The GOP has been by far the most obstructionist of both parties.

126739529,http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/jeb-bush-biggest-nightmare-common-core Why Jeb Bushs Greatest Political Achievement Could Sink a White House Run 
27144520306,If you define greatest as meaning the thing with the most impact - that would have been fixing the election in Florida (and therefore the entire country) for his brother in 2000.
27144001707,"[Factchecking common core, just a little of the nonsensical disinformation from Republicans.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/oct/21/fact-checking-common-core-school-standards/) It would be amusing if Republican lies sink Jebs chances, but somehow I dont think the country would elect another Bush yet. The people behind the objections really dont want public schools to become better. It interferes with their plans to destroy public education and replace it with voucher schools. "
27144118596,"Its the Bush name. Fool me once shame on me, Fool me twice oh wait hows that go again..."

26938867918,"Can you give an example? This is news to me if true. Maybe politifact should run a politifact article on if politifact can be trusted? I read through this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com#Criticism_of_specific_fact_checks And while I accept some of the criticisms of them, with how many articles they publish Im not sure that shows a pattern of intentional dishonesty. "
26938738163,"Yet another example of false equivalence in the media of America, trying to pretend that theres some equality between how much Democrats and Republicans lie and about what. Republicans make shit up completely out of thin air and are treated as if they have facts on their side. They lie so often that no fact-checking organization can even keep up with them. So how is it PolitiFact consistently pulls shit like claiming the biggest lie of a year was a Democrat claiming Republicans want to kill social security, when thats been the entire partys stated goal for decades now."
26938717056,Can we stop posting Politifact? They are genuinely awful and get a mind-blowing number of things wrong.
26938891028,"The meme is a bit obnoxious, but other than that it doesnt seem all that hard to fact-check such a statement. So in this particular case, what are the mind-blowing number of things wrong?"

26718284639,"you mean like how you turds claimed Bush controlled gas prices? How Halliburton did? Im not a political major but when I remove myself from major media I do know Obama and Bush are about even this very second on public approval, yet one race approved one, then the other.......

26718689676,"It worked out for a lot of people...does anyone think its purley coincidental that before the 9/11 attacks the following activity was going on: Huge surges in purchases of put options on stocks of the two airlines used in the attack -- United Airlines and American Airlines Surges in purchases of put options on stocks of reinsurance companies expected to pay out billions to cover losses from the attack -- Munich Re and the AXA Group Surges in purchases of put options on stocks of financial services companies hurt by the attack -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., and Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Huge surge in purchases of call options of stock of a weapons manufacturer expected to gain from the attack -- Raytheon Huge surges in purchases of 5-Year US Treasury Notes Cmon people???"

27075214754,I remember it clearly. There was one civilian flight in the US on Sep 12. It was the evacuation of the bin Ladens.
27075135781,Does anyone not remember how literally the day or two after 9/11 the many Bin Laden family members in the US at the time were flown out of the country without having to undergo any sort of questioning by the CIA? This is a well-documented fact.
27075493819,But...but..the Saudis are our friends and allies! Surely..no..it couldnt be!!!
27075280646,"Why would the family members if Osama bin Laden need to be questioned? They were all westernized playboys and models who live in Zurich and Riyahd. Half the family was in the US to gamble in Vegas, attend an investor conference, visit Disneyland and shop in Beverly Hills. They have less to do with an estranged uncle than you do with any of your distant relatives. Would the police question you if a cousin you hadnt seen in 20 years committed a crime?"
27075505413,Bin Laden had been a well-known terrorist for at least a decade prior to 9/11. Theres no way his family in the US hadnt been investigated up the wazoo for years.
27075317734,[deleted]
27075871759,I honestly forgot all about that until reading this. But I do remember.
27075918571,&gt; Theres no way his family in the US hadnt been investigated up the wazoo for years. Sure theres a way: friends in high places in the US.
27075919467,&gt; Why would the family members if Osama bin Laden need to be questioned? Because they were his family members. The US is holding prisoners all over the world without trial for much less cause.
27075381347,They didnt have anything to do with it and were going to be attacked just because of their name. Thats enough reason to take them out of the country 
27075332833,Nope. Not a fact.
27075753129,Not really. They spent 3 days under FBI protective custody and flown out of the country when the general grounding was lifted. 
27075175825,That was one of the first things I learned that *really* raised my eyebrows. I hadnt even begun to question the official narrative of that day yet but I can definitely say learning that really didnt sit right with me.
27075938086,[Here](http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091301flight#a091301flight) is a page with many links from reliable sources

27075648993,"Im positive that the Bin Laden family was even *more* displeased with Osama after 9/11 for just that reason. He was persona non grata with the family for years beforehand - the children of a billionaire construction magnate typically want nothing to do with the kid thats topping out the FBIs most-wanted list. Then, all of a sudden, this catastrophe goes down in the USA and Osama is implicated. The safety of the Bin Laden family members in the USA is now compromised, and The Bin Ladens very simply have the connections that will get them out of country, and I dont care what anyone says about it. I hate the conspiratorial implications in this story. I mean seriously - this grand conspiracy supposedly goes down, all air traffic is halted, and *then* the high-profile Bin Ladens get their special trip out of the country? Give me a break. Im just some dummy sitting in a sports bar and I would have evacuated the Bin Ladens a month beforehand."

27030890747,[deleted]
27030891121,"A few points of contention I have with Mr. Obama: a) The solution to joblessness is not to increase unemployment funding, its to open up funding for the many projects you promised instead of funneling it into a broken and corrupt health care reform system. b) You are the executive branch, not a dictator. You still have to work with the other branches as part of your job; if I refused to do a massive part of my job, Id be fired on the spot. c) Equal pay for equal work already exists. This tired wage-gap myth has already been thoroughly debunked. d) Good to see you invest in alternative energy. Good on you. Now lets see how much of it is given to your political donors or lost to companies like Solyndra. If you keep your word, as I hope you do, good on you. e) Mr. Obama, hearing you talk about how partisan politics is hurting America is sorta like hearing Stalin talk about how central government is inefficient. When you are the worst offender of your party, its very hard to take you serious. f) Bragging about Detroit. Really bro? g) It doesnt matter how much job training and job protection programs you create if there are no goddamn jobs. Stop spending money on stupid shit, fix our immigration system, deport illegal immigrants who commit crimes, and make an efficient legal system for immigration, and you will have a relatively healthy job system. h) $9/hr is still poverty, sir. i) At what point are we going to stop pitching manufacturing jobs, and start making jobs that are actually worth a damn and necessary? Who gives a fuck what youre manufacturing if you have no money to buy it with. j) Universal Kindergarten is a good idea. Its not yours, and you need to stop acting like it was your idea, but it still is a good idea. If you pull it off, good on you. k) Its not that people on the opposite party arent willing to compromise, its that your version of compromise is do everything your way or do nothing. Compromise entails actually offering solutions on both sides and coming to an agreement; have you ever considered the Republicans are pushing really hard against you because youre an ideologue who refuses to compromise? Theyre assholes too, but come on Barry, youre not dumb. l) Please, more substance, less sob stories. m) Also, please, stop trying to spend money we dont have. My childrens future is looking worse with every word you say. n) I almost voted for you the first time. Youre making me very glad I didnt. Please actually create solutions instead of spouting out ideas with no way to fund them or long-term plans. o) If your policies fail, can we spend the next eight years talking about how they inherited your mess and the President isnt responsible at all? p) Can you, the rest of the Democrats, and the Republicans please screw off? The Republicans are bad, but at least they understand math. EDIT :: people seem to be bitching about section p. The Republican plans are too drastic in terms of cuts, and they cut to the bone, but at least they are TRYING to balance the budget instead of spending us blind. Its telling that one party is speaking about cuts to everything across the board until we level our deficit and debt, while the other is talking about how they can possibly spend more. The Republicans are shitlords, dont get me wrong, but again, at least they get math. They understand if you have zero of something, you probably shouldnt promise people more of that zero something. EDIT Part 2 - The Edit Strikes Back :: It also is making me very sad that you guys dont understand reddiquette. You disagree with me, ok, but that doesnt mean you downvote, that means you comment and have a discussion. If this is how you Obama fans treat people you disagree with, that might be the reason nobody is willing to compromise with you or have a conversation with you."

27030907967,John Boehner looking like Americas first black speaker of the house behind Obama right now ... homie looks like he went to the tanning salon and ordered the extra crispy. 
27030907995,You can hate or love Obama. The man is a damn good public speaker. 
27030908060,Boehner is about to get up and punch Obama if we look at his face very closely. I called it.
27030908129,"Could somebody please explain to me what the major topic being discussed is? I just recently got to see part of it and it was something about minimum wage?

27030933476,"Two sentences about the NSA, no comment on benghazi, no comment about Marijuana legalization, didnt mention snowden. But its ok 4 year olds are getting Grade A nap time. "
27030934991,"Ugh so sick of hearing the Republicans bitching about Obamacare and how it takes away peoples insurance. Its fucking bullshit - the reason your insurance is being changed is because it does NOT meet the minimum federal standards, aka your plan is shit. You should be happy that you arent paying for something that is substandard and that you are going to be receiving a better plan."

27030938434,"President Obama really is the best republican president we have had in literally decades. The right has gone so very far to the right that he might appear liberal, but in reality he is just a moderate republican. If the republicans in the house were not crazy, and the democrats were not so spineless we would have fixed many of the common sense things he talked about tonight. Now I am watching some apple pie spewing AMERICAN FUCK YEAH lady talk about in platitudes. All I can say is that you all had better vote next election."
27030938872,Seriously Republcians how do you fall for this shit? is the thought of being considered equal to the 1% because of your race and religion more important than what actually is?

27030941617,Shes still talking about herself..... Someone needs to tell her that this is meant to be a response to Obamas speech and not a speech about her life. 
27030941770,"lol @ a kid with Down Syndrome loving Bruce Springsteen. Also I GUARANTEE he doesnt actually do that shit. He might dance to some music, but the most American of musicians as a name drop was DEFINITELY a plant."

27030947502,"Turn down the gain on the microphone, I just want to hear her not whats happening inside of her."
27030947512,"One hell of a speech, as they said on NBC: very center left agenda phrased in a center right friendly fashion. Funny enough to keep everyone engaged, and serious enough to instill confidence. Quite an amazing standing ovation for the injured veteran. Like the increase in federal wages, and the way Barry wants to handle the nuclear situation in Iran. U.S.A.!! "
27030947702,A prayer? WTF is this?

27030948023,I think the 4 republicans are having a contest seeing who can say more BS in 10mins. This lady is winning atm.
27030948247,At least shes talking about opportunity instead of entitlement.
27030948257,Brookland stand up!
27030948318,"I understand a token God Bless is expected, but why is she praying to god every five minutes?"
27030948344,*Brookland* Pre K? Why would we ever want to fund that?!

27030948932,What is with her opening her eyes real big?
27030948980,Well that was a bit tame. Looking forward to the crazy versions though.
27030949200,"You ever notice that wherever you go, Brookland is always in the house?"
27030949287,"Much more moderate response than usual for the GOP. Now comes three more...the Espanol one, the Tea Party one and the Rand Paul Party one."
27030949498,Meant to soften the Republican image Oh brother.
27030949962,"Wait, that was the response? Aside from Tax Breaks, School Choice and nebulous health care reform I dont remember anything specific? Isnt this the party that has congress and could actually put forward specific proposals, or am I miss-understanding the American process?"
27030950343,The first thing Fox News is stating after the GOP response is that its hard to follow the act of presidents SOTU speech.
27030950811,"cbs literally said next to nothing about the republican response because there was almost no coherent agenda, just talk about downs syndrome and appeals to god"
27030951265,Al Sharpton compared the response to a Hallmark card.
27030951404,How are these people on NBC supporting the republican response? Theyre talking about how great her response was...
27030951783,Paul Krugman: Where was the content? There was nothing there!
27030951982,A hallmark card. Thats exactly what it was

27030953890,"not a single NSA mention! we did it guys, the NSA is gone forever!"
27030954280,Anyone else catch how loud her blinking was? Right at the end of her response... *BLINK* *BLINK*

I think the enemy combatant program clearly is illegal, but until a court stands up and says so, its legal. II. Obama put an end to using black sites on his second day of office. He also refused to challenge the previous administration on the legality of this practice. Congress would also have a hard time pressing charges against Obama about this because they knew about it and approved the practice. III. President Bush was quite open about bypassing the FISA courts when spying on Americans. The practice has gone unchallenged legally, and so it continues. IV. This is a power that presidents have exercised for more than 50 years. Signing statements are subject to judicial review, but a signing statement would have to be a pretty serious violation of existing law for it to justify impeachment. V. I Googled this. Interesting. There have been a few Congressional Subpoenas issued that the Obama administration has not complied with (The Fort Hood Shootings, HHS regarding Health Care implementation, Fast &amp; Furious and other smaller items). I didnt know enough about this. I dont want to disagree on this one. I would say, however, that Congress has a lot of power that they are not exercising. [This article was helpful](http://www.talkleft.com/story/2007/7/8/1731/15806/lawrelated/The-Congressional-Subpoena-Power-How-It-Is-Enforced) (but long. And technical) VI. Thats a stretch. From where I sit this ACA is a *gift* to private insurers. As far as misleading Congress, its Congress who created the bill, not Obama. If there is an attempt to destroy the private insurance market, creating a mandate that every American has to buy private insurance seems like a strange way to do it. VII. [Obama has increased border security](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jul/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/more-border-security-and-patrols-under-obama-previ/). [He dramatically increased the number of deportations](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/10/american-principles-action/has-barack-obama-deported-more-people-any-other-pr/). VIII. The claim that there were intelligence warnings of terrorist attacks in Benghazi is unsubstantiated. There is nothing there. IX. The claim that the IRS unfairly investigated conservative Tea Party groups has also been debunked. Liberal political groups were equally targeted. I dont mean to be an Obama apologist. I genuinely believe that the power exercised by every President since Nixon is an overreach of the position and would very much like to see that power restrained. It could be that impeachment of a President is what needs to happen, but really Congress just needs to get its shit together and reclaim some of those powers. Impeachment was an arguable reality with Bush. Fabricating facts in order to lead the nation to attack a foreign country is a giant accusation. Outing a CIA agent is a smaller crime than leading a nation to war on fix facts, but still certainly a high crime. "

26943589793,"Bullshit. ER visits are a red herring and contribute between 2-10% of the cost of healthcare. A bigger driver is the fact that Medicare and Medicaid patients only provide the providers with 60 cents on the dollar that private insurance provides. The providers (hospitals and doctors) overcharge the insurance company to make up for the shortfall that government care causes, and then and only then does the insurance company pass that cost onto you. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/28/nick-gillespie/does-emergency-care-account-just-2-percent-all-hea/"

Private insurance is a scam. When Americans are paying twice as much for healthcare than any other countries, with outcomes that are declining (as in life expectancy is dropping, infant mortality is up, etc.) then obviously private insurance is failing, because insurance companies care about profits (excuse me Wall St.) to the exclusivity of all else.

Wikipedia article on it, but I can only find one on [RationalWiki](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop).) Its a technique developed by creationist debater Duane Gish in which you overwhelm your opponent with mountains of misleading and false statements. It always takes the opponent more time to address the lie than it does to state it, so the opponent cannot address anywhere near all of your points in their allowed time. This leaves the opponent with three poor choices: 1) address as many points as possible, 2) make no rebuttals and focus on other issues within the scope of the debate, or 3) call you a liar and then do 1 or 2. If the opponent chooses option one, you simply say that they failed to address all of your points and therefore they must be wrong because they cannot explain things. If the opponent chooses option two, say that they didnt address any of your statements because they must not have an answer. If they choose option three, accuse them of making baseless accusations (because they dont have enough time to prove all of your lies, see option one rebuttal), then rinse and repeat. This leaves your opponent in a perpetual state of damage control, scrambling to keep up with the mountain of complete garbage you throw into the debate. If they address your statements, they lose. If they dont address your statements, they lose. If they call you out on it, they lose. And if you do it enough the audience will start to believe what youre saying.

26919591819,"So let me get this right -- GOP was supposed to support a piece of legislation that was crafted behind closed Dem party doors (without the promised C-Span coverage) with crafty presidential deals and letters not worth the paper written on, where long and deeply held moral and religious beliefs are trampled, where waivers are passed out like Stalinist favors to big corporate buddies and cronies, where the public couldnt find out what was in it until after it was passed, where you cant keep your insurance or your doctor, and where the Hill leaders pushing the bill have a childish habit of being nasty to the GOP. In other words, the GOP is just supposed to shut up and support the worst legislation to come down the pike since Rostenkowskis catastrophic healthcare plan. Right. "

27036630716,"It kind of makes sense that part of the gap is because the jobs women usually take are lower paying jobs that the jobs men usually take. But then you have to consider if a job like school teacher is only low paying because its dominated by women, whereas a job like computer programmer is higher paying because its dominated by men. From one of the comments: &gt; Ive studied salaries over time for clergy. Salaries went down as women entered the market. I often heard church boards argue that they could call a woman for less money. I think this has driven down wages in that field. For some of your low paying jobs it may be that the salaries are lower because women are in them, not because they paid less before women entered them. It would be informative to look at the salaries of secretaries and school teachers over time, to see if the transition from male domination to female domination correlates with a decrease in salaries, simply because employers feel they can pay women less, and therefore they will also pay men less."
27036611070,"&gt; What is wrong and embarrassing is the President of the United States reciting a massively discredited factoid. The 23-cent gender pay gap is simply the difference between the average earnings of all men and women working full-time. It does not account for differences in occupations, positions, education, job tenure, or hours worked per week. **When all these relevant factors are taken into consideration, the wage gap narrows to about five cents.** And no one knows if the five cents is a result of discrimination or some other subtle, hard-to-measure difference between male and female workers. I know why the President lies about this, but whats your excuse for not calling out the 23 cent gender gap as a lie?"

26939794468,"Quite a bit separates the two parties. You might not consider abortion or gun ownership to be important, but that doesnt mean they arent valid reasons for supporting one platform over another. --- &gt; Both support big business and bailouts. Both receive financing from big business. This one is correct and unfortunate. &gt; Both support interventionist foreign policy Thats a very vague phrasing. Democrats are more opposed to military action than republicans as a general rule. The push to bomb Iran is largely Republican. &gt; Both have made war in countries we didnt need to be in. This statement doesnt really mean anything. Its just a personal opinion about where we didnt need to be. Its overly simplistic to suggest that the US didnt need to be involved in the World Wars. The US participation in the WWI and WWII are arguably what pushed our economy to dominate the world stage for 50 years. &gt; Both continue to support a federal reserve system that loans the government currency that carries interest, which makes it impossible to ever get out of debt. The US government has been in debt *since in was founded*. There were a few years around 1835 were the US had almost no debt, [^(1)](http://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/debt-and-gdp-main6.png?w=1024&amp;h=603) but the US being in debt is not a new phenomena. &gt; It was a democrat that stole all privately held gold. I assume that youre referring to [Executive Order 6102](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) or 1933? Where the government ordered all private gold owners to *sell* their gold to the government at a price of $20.67 per ounce? &gt; Democrats got us involved in WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. The most recent war in that list started 57 years ago... Also its *HIGHLY* disingenuous to say that the democrats got us involved in WWII. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was was drew the US into WWII. &gt; The democrats started the welfare state that has failed to lift people out of poverty. Actually, many Americans (38.9%) will find themselves in poverty at some point in their life[^(2)](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/PageError.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/Default.aspx), but programs like welfare and food stamps help lift these people out of poverty so that only 11.6% will have experienced more than 5 years of poverty. There are also thousands of other factors that contribute to American poverty. &gt; Obama assassinated US citizens. Thats a very grey area. The only American who was intentionally targeted was Anwar Al-Awlaki, who was a self-proclaimed Jihadist working for Al Qaeda in Pakistan who claimed to have trained the underwear bomber.[^(3)](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57585798/who-were-the-4-u.s-citizens-killed-in-drone-strikes/) &gt; Obama expanded the drone strikes in the middle east. Correct, but drone strikes have lower civilian casualty rates than traditional warfare. You can argue against being in Afghanistan at all (and I would agree with you), but increasing drone use might be preferable to other forms of combat. &gt; The Obama administration has ruled that drone strikes against US citizens on our soil is within the executive powers. Again... thats a very grey area. The white house made it clear that they were only referring to someone who posed an immediate threat to the lives of others. Much in the same way a police officer is authorized to use deadly force without going through a trial. Personally I dont see the need for drone strikes inside the country, but the justification is not entirely without merit. &gt; Obama refuses to close Gitmo. Actually Obama has repeatedly tried to close Guantanamo, but has been blocked by Congressional Republicans, notably Ted Cruz.[^(4)](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/177/close-the-guantanamo-bay-detention-center/)"
26939899782,"On a phone so I cant format like your post, but will follow its outline the best I can. Guns and abortion - both are ways to get their people elected to maintain the status quo. Interventionist foreign policy - the Republicans want to attack Iran, Democrats want to attack Syria and did get involved in Libya. Wars we didnt need to be in - I can almost grant WWII a pass because the Japs attacked us. But they attacked us because of our economic sanctions. Again due to interventionist foreign policy. But all the other wars we were not in immediate danger of being invaded. The closest would have been WWI, the Zimmerman note that promised Mexico all the lands lost in 1848 if they sided with the Central powers and invaded te US. Our solution, war with Germany. The Federal Reserve - They print the only legal tender. We have to buy their tender with treasury bonds that are worth more down the road than is paid for them up front. They return the bonds for more than they paid, meaning we have to issue more bonds than before to cover the interest on the previous bonds to buy more FR notes to begin the process over again. We can neer even begin to pay our debt in this system. Stolen gold - yup, FDR ordered all privately held gold turned over to the government for $20/oz, then revalued it at $35/oz to sell to other governments. They stole value if nothing else. Welfare state and poverty - those of us at the threshold have been taxed into poverty in a failed attempt to end poverty. We are not living in LBJs utopian great society. Assassination of US citizens - is this Anwar al-alwaki the father that was assassinated or his son that was also assassinated. And being US citizens they are guaranteed a trial. Even when a cop kills someone that poses an immediate threat is not justified. We are guaranteed a trial. Remember Dorner? When the cops had him surrounded bit instead of trying to take him alive they burned the cabin. The state does not need the authority to use lethal force. The state is made up of people just like you or me. Does their costume make them special? Drone strike - Lower civillian casialties. Maybe. But at least with ground troops if we piss of the people were attacking they can fight back. Drone strikes are totally one sided. Gitmo - Its a military base. He can move the prisoners or order a trial for them. He is the Commander in Chief afterall. Both parties are basically the same. Maintain the status quo, dont rock the boat too much. Statism."

27127066378,"Bush wasnt going to lose no matter how you look at it. Americans were pretty stupid around the 2004 election and people didnt start to realize how badly the Bush administration fucked this country until after 2006. Remember Bush had the big scandal in which Dick Cheney ordered one of his staff to leak the name of a CIA operative in order to retaliate against her husband. They held the investigation so that it wouldnt conclude until after the campaign. You also had the Alberto Gonzalez attorney scandals in which the Bush administration went after Federal Prosecutors who werent toeing the Republican party line. Obama has had plenty of scandals in his presidency but none of them are anything like Bushs.

26921993534,"The thing that both parties are going to lentghs to pretend doesnt exist is the mandates of the free trade agreements like GATS which basically preordained only one outcome to the whole healthcare debate for the US years ago, a situation which results in a lot of people dying unnecessarily every year as the US gets more and more behind the developed countries on healthcare quality. Just so the corprations can use the investor-state provisions to coercively gain access to markets in other countries. So, I cant see any explanation other than that the two parties wanted the US to get a privatization of the system because anything else JUST WOULD NOT DO, given our stance - a stance which almost no Americans would understand - because it seems very immoral to view things like public healthcare and efficient, low cost provision of services as a theft of a market from its corporate owners, which is how the free trade agreements frame things. So, so the means by which big US corporations shoehorn open foreign markets would not hav eto be changed, each American is going to have to spend a half million dollars they otherwise would not have to spend, over their lifetimes... This was too important to leave up to democracy, so the corporations have been working on making it something that nations could not change through democracy and thats what the politicians are trying to do, lock in privatized healthcare irreversibly. So, they both decided to play good cop bad cop and pretend to disagree. They are posturing a fair amount but in fact they agree a lot more than disagree. They agreed to put corporate interests ahead of Americans interests, even though thats something which represents a very real betrayal of the best interests of the people of America, all of us. Something they know we can no longer afford.. They did this to block single payer, paid for by taxes, everybody in, nobody out, all doctors in network, no more gag clauses, no more tiers, no more bankruptcies. Single payer which we can afford, and which would save a huge amount of money. **Instead we got something much like what they have in Massachusetts which has resulted in NO shrinkage of medical debt and no improvement in affordability.** The result is that weve been shoehorned into a healthcare model we havent been able to afford since the 90s, and nothing else got discussed. This is in a context of healthacre financing experts already knowing before the 2008 election that none of the things purported by Obama would save money. All in all its been a really disgraceful acting performance for all of them. They have let the American public down miserably. "
26921561143,"I wouldnt say Obama lied, but there really wasnt a central debate about the nuanced aspects of the legislation. Instead we got screaming about Death Panels. So the press, opposition (conservatives), and ignorant fellow countrymen all failed us in this respect. Incidentally, this very much reminds me of how people talk about Obamas campaign promises. As though those promises were the central discussion in the 2008 election. There was no in depth discussion about whether closing Gitmo COULD be implemented because everything was being drowned out by a shouting match about whether Obama was a communist or whatever. "
26921849403,"Personally, I think people are just dumb when it comes to Obamas misinterpretation of You can keep your plan if you want to. If the person has read anything about the ACA, they know that it establishes plan minimums, and obviously if the plan you have doesnt meet those minimums then its against the law. Will it be more expensive? Sure, if it covers more then it will probably cost a little more. At no point do I honestly think Obama meant to lie to people.

So, while bending the truth and living in his own little fantasy world, he was not bold faced lying. He was just, living in a reality that may not entirely coincide with ours. Politicians do this all the time. Sometimes theyre more pronounced, sometimes they are outright lies, but not often are they so visible and so definitive that you can truly nail them down over it. Hell claim that youre better off not having those plans, and that you shouldnt have wanted those plans. Sure thats your choice, but thats what hell say. Personally we should have just gone to a universal paid-by-taxes system that did away with all this crap and been done with it. But whatever."

26921967354,So this has gone from being good thing for our country and the millions of people without healthcare to still a good thing for our country and the millions of people without healthcare and a minor inconvenience for handful of people? This is what the Republicans were so concerned about that they have to lie about its effects on a near daily basis?

26922052884,I think people mis-understood the spirit of what Obama was saying. His point was that this new plan wouldnt eradicate older plans. 
26922082727,"Its not complicated. Obama either lied or hes an idiot. You lefties want to defend Obama by trying to refocus the attention on lying republicans but no matter how much you try to refocus it, the fact remains that this whole healthcare act is all Obama and the liberals doing. You can say republicans are lying and fear mongering but it can also be said that some of them are self diluted idiots who are exaggerating too. The failures of Obamas healthcare act and how the republicans are capitalizing on his failure are separate issues. So when I hear John Stewart finding a way to somehow turn this back on republicans, it only shows how biased he really is. He appears to be objective but hes not, its all part of his cute Im witty and smart brand. His priority is the marketability of his show. Cmon reddit, youre his target market. You should know better. Bottom line, these politicians and the majority of Americans, especially redditors, dont understand economics. If you did understand how a functional economy works, youd know both the old and news systems are flawed down to the core and nothing will change because everyone is somehow benefited by it, in one way or another.

Thats why they added in the Government subsidies to help people pay for them, in many cases while the plan will be more expensive the costs will be picked up by the Government and many people will personally pay less. I have very little sympathy for people who dont pay attention to things their Government is doing. None of this was hidden from you except by your own ignorance. "
26922139434,"I think the point to his comment was if the healthcare bill was or is as bad as the opponents of said bill claim it to be they wouldnt have the need to invent stories and sling constant lies about it.

OR IT MIGHT CAUSE SPONTANEOUS MALE PREGNANCY. No, it being poisonous is bad enough you dont have to give me a little song and dance number unless you think it really isnt bad at all and just need to tilt the balance between me being bit and not being bit. And in relation to Obama being dishonest Jon Stewart also gave plenty of jabs and punch lines involving Obama and Obamacare but his political satire makes a good point. Healthcare was even worse prior to Obamacare or did everyone forget that part already? Obviously its far from perfect and the bar just happens to be very very low. "

26893372788,"I [linked](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/citizen.asp) to the Snopes article in another comment since they explain it pretty clearly. Basically, while a Kenyan born Obama would have been eligible for citizenship due to his mothers heritage, he would not be born with it due to residency requirements of what was then the law. The law required a US residency of one of the parents for so many years after a certain age, which his mother was too young to have. This would bring into question whether or not natural-born means literally born with citizenship or just born with the possibility of citizenship. For instance if I married a woman in France and had children, they would have citizenship from both. If their children also become citizens automatically, then eventually all of France and most of Europe would be American citizens."
26893356227,"&gt; the argument can be made that a Kenyan born Obama would not be a natural born citizen but a Canadian born Cruz would be. I asked you to explain this. I read the rest of your post. I want you to explain how, even if he was born in the middle of Mecca and his father was the Ayatollah, Obama wouldnt be a natural born citizen when his mother was a US citizen.

26836853882,"I dont understand why this is even being argued. The NSA is clearly collecting data, and they were doing so previously without our knowledge. It fits perfectly with one of the definitions of spying, even if it doesnt fit your personal definition (which wasnt wrong, it was just the first definition).

26722841740,"The Clinton impeachment was not at all about Clinton. After all, we were in the middle of one of the most prosperous times in the history of the US, and he was already in his second term. No... that impeachment was an attempt at swaying public opinion away from the ridiculously popular Clinton/**Gore** duo. They needed a way to secure victory in 2000, and the only way to do that was somehow shine a negative light on Gore. The whole political strategy for the Bush-Cheney ticket was in the works long before the 2000 election. In fact it started pretty much as soon as Bush 1 lost re-election and [Cheney was forced to re-enter civilian life.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2000/08/cheneys-multi-million-dollar-revolving-door) The impeachment gambit barely worked, requiring the Republican-led legislature of Florida to completely fuck the election results. I mean honestly, how much time, money and effort was put forth in seeking the truth about a mother-fucking blowjob? And what actually came of it in regards to its effect on Clinton while he was in office? Anything? Zero. Fast-forward to today, and the same thing is happening again except insert Benghazi. History and politics are just repeats of the same old shit. Republicans have no chance in 2016 unless they can squash Hillary. Look how ridiculous they were in the last cycle. Their primaries are a complete joke. Mother-fucking Michelle Bachmann, Hermann Cain? Are you kidding me? The Democrats dont really have any more viable candidate than Hillary at the moment, so thats why shes being targeted so heavily. Pay no attention to what the talking heads say about her not being a target regarding Benghazi. A bigger bullseye could not possibly be painted on her right now. Its blatantly obvious when Paul Rand comes out and says shes not fit for ever holding public office again. Politics, politics, politics. Its incredibly sad that were in this state. Republicans have no desire to actually govern and advance society. They are only concerned about finding ways to make the rich get richer and securing their own jobs. Thats literally all they want to do, hence the 100% obstructionism right now. If all they do is talk about Benghazi for the next three years without actually accomplishing anything, they will have achieved their objective: squash Hillarys chances in 2016 and install yet another cluster fuck administration that will probably permanently destroy the economy. The whole thing is pathetic. All of congress needs to be replaced."
26722905228,Now thats an I can get behind.

Obama administration is caught using the IRS to target political opponents. Obama administration wiretaps personal phones of AP reporters. Obama parties with celebrities. And thats just this week.

26722886685,"To be fair, Clinton also lied about leading us into war. We just didnt pay much attention to that because the economy was good so only domestic stuff mattered.

26722978984,"Yeah but your dumb ass is probably to dumb to realize or even care that Clinton tried more than once to invade Iraq. You seem to think that Democrats are good and Republicans are bad. They are are both equally worthless. They are two heads of the same coin and your dumb ass falls for it every time. Heres a brief little history lesson for you, they were the same fucking party, and split in two to monopolize the political process. Your dumb ass thinks you have a two party system. You have one party under two different names. You: Wars started by Bush bad. Wars started by Obama good. Me: Doesnt fucking matter, war is bad period."
26722469805,Shah. 
26722514932,That is an interesting case. There seems to be a lot more than meets the eye. Why did it happen when it did? Why was the case brought to attention even though FBI investigators found no illegal conduct...hmmm

26722573086,Clinton got impeached? Guess I missed that part.

26722748281,also: Benghazi.
26722772407,The high water mark about all of this for me was when Dennis Kucinich was trying to get Bush impeached there was a particular day where Kucinich got his 23rd or 25th co-signer for the impeachment bill AND John Stewart had Bill Clinton on his show. This happened on the same day. Anyway Stewart just softballs Clinton through the whole interview and never once asked the question you are discussing. If Stewart had asked Clinton what he thought about being impeached for his behavior meanwhile Bush was busy murdering people and lying about it without zero repercussions whatsoever then I think it would have blown the lid off of the media blackout on Kucinichs impeachment activities. It would have made a difference. I lost all respect for Clinton and Stewart both that day. Not to mention the entire democractic party. That was the day they all lost my support forever. Havent watched the daily show since.
26722813933,"Nobody was serious about the impeachment. Thats why the sent Ken Starr, instead of a real lawyer. "
26722816370,"Thats because there were other justifications for those wars. And please dont downplay what Clinton did... even if youre doing so for good reasons. Having an affair, then lying under oath, tells us A LOT about a persons character. Losing that trust was a huge deal. We should remember it as such. "
26722821267,How many false statements have been made by Obama and his aids regarding Benghazi?
26722831751,"Clinton perjured himself while in office. Honesty and integrity are the most important requirements for President to the American people. Bush had amazingly high approval ratings during his call to war until it declined around his second term. HoR was Republican controlled until 2006, so he got away with a lot. Both lied to the people, one was caught while in office and one wasnt. Even if the Dems had substantial evidence for false reports on WMDs, they wouldnt have been likely to act on it. No one wants to contest a President with over 90% approval rating, its political suicide and sadly this is why were just now getting reports of how bogus the executive branchs claims for war were."
26722860973,Stupid. Sometimes. Throw them all out? How? Im game. 
26722855575,Why are you all so stupid as to believe one side is any better than the other? Throw them all out.
26722873837,Bush never used the US military to help his marriage. 
26722912196,"Oh fuck off with that one. Clinton: - Allowed Iraqis to be starved through sanctions. Albright then said this was a justified action on 60 Minutes. **Lie #1: Children are sacred.** - Blew up the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing 4, hunting terrorists with NATO-banned B2 bombers. **Lie #2: The international community loved America under Democratic leadership.** - Chose Janet Reno, known across the country as the adjudicator during the brainwashed children sex cases allowing for the arrest and incarceration of many innocent people at the hands of child therapist with an agenda. **Lie #3: Under Clinton, the media was all about objectivity and the Department of Justice was all about justice.** - Let the ATF press charges against their own undercover agent, Carol Howe, after it is revealed she knew and attempted to warn the government about plans to bomb the Murrah building. **Lie #4: The government valued and appreciated good intel during the 90s.** - Murdered the Branch Davidians through an extremely silent White House during the suffocation of allegedly abused children at the hands of a militarized FBI. **Lie #5: The Federal Government is a benevolent state in the hands of a popular Democratic president.** Overall, the lies of Clinton killed as many, or more, than Bush, with far more domestic killings done in the name of Homeland Security. Under his administration, the PATRIOT act was concocted in the months leading up the Oklahoma City Bombing by now Vice President Joe Biden as the Omnibus Counterterrorist Act of 1996. Let it not be said that Clinton only got a blow job when we discuss his heinous and malformed presidency."
26722994887,"Oh heres a little tid bit of info for your Dem loving ass. More people have died in wars while Democrats were in office than Republicans. Most wars the US has fought were started while Democrats were in office. Oh yeah if you want to talk about Clinton getting impeached a blow job, if he cant even be true to one person, his wife, how truthful do you think hes going to be to a country. Oh yeah and I know the down votes aer coming for this but dont give a fuck, so just to get you fucktards started I gave myself a downvote, have a nicee day."

26914853633,As a Nebraskan im glad something from the state is looking positive in the news.
26915013843,"I think its more a matter of this being the only feasible option. If you let it vary by state youd open up a huge can of worms: Gay service members wouldnt want to serve in certain states if they knew it could affect their benefits. But in the military you dont always get to choose where youre going to serve. Also, certain assignments may be better for promotion and if one is in an anti-gay marriage state that would force the service member to potentially miss out on benefits due them to remain competitive in their career. If youre familiar with how the military works and try to think through options that would let the states dictate marriage for service members youll quickly realize that theres really no way to do it. Either you find yourself codifying discrimination in a manner thats pretty obvious (and vulnerable to legal challenge) or youre vague, leave a lot of it up to the states, and end up with an incoherent patchwork of rules thats nearly impossible to administer."
26914853535,"I dont know anyone who is going through the same-sex benefits process in the regular army, but its been officially open to homosexuals for a few weeks now. "

26914945401,"it should be noted that he is a republican. I mainly say this, not because republicans tend to be homophobes and anti gay marriage but because people seem to be blissfully unaware that dems do that. Dems always put republicans in charge of defense. It is a right wing post.[ Obama has a record number of republicans in his cabinet.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/10/barack-obama/Three-Republicans-Cabinet-Most/) (but he is the partisan one.. Obama has a republican sect of commerce, transportation and defense and the right still filibustered gates because everyone gets filibustered under Obama) The right dont do this. The right never put dems in charge of the labor or the EPA or anything else that is seen as left wing bush head of hud.. republican.. epa republican, labor, republican.. sect of health cand human services .. republican. He did have one dem, the head of transportation. But they never put a dem in charge of anything seen as left wing. The dems always have a republican defense sect."
26915022427,just let me believe that somebody with power decided to do something good for once. why cant this happen ever?

Im all for personal responsibility and understand having sex very well can lead to a baby, but no matter how much we can say wait till marriage, wait till you are financially stable to have sex, it isnt going to happen. Closing abortions clinics will not save the state money. If someone gets pregnant who can not afford a child, and now can not have the means to have an abortion, the state is going to be paying A LOT more money for the next 18 years to care for this child, then had the women been able to have an abortion. Lets not also forget about medically necessary abortions as well, for either the life of the mother, or knowing that a baby is going to be born with a chronic disease, or other serious medical problem.

26770409424,The reason no one knows what has happened is because right now the Texas Senate has no idea what the hell it did or didnt do.
26770367191,"Let me try to explain this for everyone: The Texas parliamentary rules allow a filibuster to be prematurely ended after three successful specific points of order, two of which are 1) if the person carrying out the filibuster speaks on a subject that is not *germane* - that is, related to the bill under discussion - or 2) if the person carrying out the filibuster accepts physical aid from anyone else (as it was ruled accepting the back brace was) or sits down, etc. The Republican chair made a ruling on a point of order that may only be overturned by a majority vote (**thus, invalidating the entire point of a filibuster**, the purpose of which is to *survive* a simple majority). The Republicans unfairly (i.e., entirely against their own Rules of Parliamentary Procedure) acted to table the filibuster, which would allow them to move forward with regular business and proceed with a vote. You would have to hold a legislative session in the utter absence of decorum to rule that sonograms are not germane to a discussion of abortions. According to Texas own rules: germaneness is not a precise concept. To institute such a strict definition of germaneness is to scrap an entirely legitimate filibuster in order to get their way. tl;dr: in Texas, the filibuster might as well not exist if you accept the Republicans ruling on germaneness.

All to kill Rick Perrys anti-abortion bill that could close all but 5 clinics in the state. "

26769816005,"&gt;The record for the longest filibuster goes to U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, according to U.S. Senate records. &gt;Thurmond began speaking at 8:54 p.m. on Aug. 28 and continued until 9:12 p.m. the following evening, reciting the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, President George Washingtons farewell address and other historical documents along the way. Thurmond was not the only lawmaker to filibuster on the issue, however. According to Senate records, teams of senators consumed 57 days filibustering between March 26 and June 19, the day the Civil Rights Act of 1957 passed. muh 13 hours"
26769822326,Its nice to see a woman I voted for using the GOPs tactics against them. Go Wendy!

26769826142,To me this goes past the issue of the bill she is protesting. Does it not speak to the ridiculousness of the current state of politics that they took her seat away and she cant so much as lean on the desk or take a break? How does any of that have the best interests of the people at heart. To me that makes the entire senate look like a joke of an institution.

26769833848,Good. Knock this stupid ass bill right out of the running.
26769836707,"This is more important than most people realize. The abortion laws passed in the last few years are a nationally coordinated effort of the religious right, intended to overwhelm the opposition and the courts, and written from templates provided by the evangelicals anti-abortion organization, Americans United for Life. What far too many dont recognize is that most of those laws and the efforts to pass them is defiance of our Constitution, the rights it guarantees, and the Supreme Court decisions that confirmed those rights. Thats betrayal of the oaths of office to support and defend our Constitution. "
26769837017,"The constitution says abortion is legal. Republicans want to go against the Constitution. Instead of outright banning abortions in Texas, Texas Republicans are looking to close abortion clinics by changing the rules, causing 80% of clinics to close, leaving only 5 clinics for all of TX. This will also end up raising the price for an abortion. In the end, it will mean less access to abortions (especially in rural areas) and, most likely, more tax money spent on government support of these parents and children when they are born. I was there protesting on Sunday and I will be there again tonight to support Wendy Davis."
26769837729,"Outstanding. I hope she can swing it.. Edit: for the record, Im pro-life. Not rabidly so. Ill never stand out in front of a clinic with a bullhorn. I wont badger anyone. If it was someone I knew, Id try to talk them out of it, but Id respect their choice. Thats what this is all about. Having a choice. Also, those clinics also provide birth control and OB-GYN services to women at risk."
26769841766,"On the one hand, the filibuster is a frankly *fucktarded* political tactic, I mean just incredibly stupid bureaucratic wank. On the other, this is a vile, stupid, pompous piece of legislation with enormous negative outcomes and no consideration to the consequences. I guess what Im saying is, yall are pretty fucked, but I would buy that lady a drink."
26769854428,Im still waiting for my reimbursement from Rick Perry using my tax money to remodel his house. 
26769875349,"To those saying that Abortion is wrong because its murder and babies are innocent victims: First of all, Murder is TOTALLY okay under multiple circumstances, there are a zillion scenarios where it is absolutely within the law to kill someone against their will. Some people are awarded fucking MEDALS for it. Im not saying murder is nice or right or whatever, Im just saying that if you claim abortion should be illegal because its murder, that argument does not hold up in the U.S.A. As for the I want to save the babies argument: Why is it okay that 33% of ALL PREGNANCIES (read: billions of people) meet their demise through natural miscarriage before being born? There is no one marching to save them, or to shame their mothers. No one reminds the world that these babies are dying and have experienced pain and EVERYONE needs to intervene. How many old white guys are losing their shit over what has been an accepted part of humanitys reproductive pattern (losing 33% of fertilized eggs/pregnancies to miscarriage?) Oh - thats right, none. Why? Because it is totally okay with these people if natural forces (ie - not HER) cause a woman to miscarry (which by the way, is presumably equally painful for fetuses as abortion) but it is NOT okay for a woman to compel the same process to occur in her own body. So: If your sympathy truly is for saving babies, there are a zillion times more babies dying via natural miscarriage then there are babies being willingly aborted. Shouldnt this be the focus for all the effort from the Pro-Life camp? Shouldnt Pro-Life people be outraged that women are even allowed to attempt to conceive after 6, 8, 10 repeated Early pregnancy losses? Shouldnt they say: A women who has that many miscarriages has inadvertantly caused the death of 6, 8, 10 babies and should not be allowed to try again in order to prevent the likely death of additional babies? Shouldnt they be pushing for homicide investigations for all miscarriages? Shouldnt they be burying their own miscarried babies with full funeral service? Shouldnt they be absolutely devastated to hear when someone has had a miscarriage? Why arent the masses lobbying to investigate this phenomenon? Why are there no investigations into miscarriage as possible neglect or homicide? Why are there not millions of bull-horn blowers bawling their eyes out in front of hospitals for miscarried babies? Are miscarried babies not as important as the aborted ones??? Did they not endure the same (alleged) pain as an aborted baby? The difference, plain and simple, is that pro-life (pro-birth) people do not think women should have the same power to influence the outcome of her pregnancy that nature has. A bona - fide Baby Saving Operation would be focused on how to save as many babies as possible from demise. The Pro-Life operation does not focus on this. Instead, it focuses on How to Force Women to give Birth against their will. Personally, I think the supposed grief over aborted babies and concern for fetal happiness is a sham. Its clear that the focus is on a means of pregnancy demise that actually accounts for a VERY low number of dead babies when compared to other (natural) causes. I know of many, many women who have had early miscarriages and have not cried about it or even given it much thought. But a woman who admits to a remorseless abortion???? look out. Here come the Shame Police, who will gladly cry for her dead baby Its bullshit. Its an effort to disallow women control over their own bodies. Period. Dead babies has nothing to do with it. You go, Wendy Davis. Maybe you can offer Rick Perry the opportunity of examining your vagina for signs of pregnancy before you proceed. A 13 hour filibuster could have adverse effects on an unborn fetus, and of course, Uncle Rick only wants whats best for them."

26769950418,"Im sick of all these people trying to control other peoples lives because they dont agree with them (specifically abortion and homosexuality). Personally, I dont particularly like abortion, but all it means to me is that Im not going to get one. Its as simple as that. Women know there are alternatives, but no matter what they choose, its not going to be easy for them. People need to back the fuck off and mind their own business. "
26769950540,What the fuck? Why is this how we have to get shit done in congress? Fucking games.
26769951292,"Everyone is claiming shes a hero, but when Rand Paul filibustered, everyone cried about how the GOP filibustered to get there way. Rick Perry still represents about half of the population in Texas, whether you like abortion or not. Theyll mindlessly obey his commands too. Yawn."

26769953746,Someone get /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza on this. People sent pizza to Rand Paul during his filibuster and I think Wendy Davis deserves the same treatment. Nothing like showing your appreciation for someone by sending them enough deep-dish pizzas to last for a month.
26769954452,"Its ridiculous that this is a legitimate tactic. Edit: I assume the downvotes are because people think I disagree with what shes doing. To be clear, Im all for it. Fuck those guys. I support the right to choose. I just think its ridiculous that that is a legitimate tactic for deciding things in our legal system. "

26769984276,Im glad someone is standing up against these ignorant assholes.
26769986897,"Given that this is Texas, why not just pass a law stating that all abortions must be carried out with a handgun? Theres no way in hell Texas Republicans would be against abortion then."

26769995565,"Im donating $5 to NARAL and $5 to EMILYs List for each hour Sen. Davis speaks. Im also offering to match donations from my facebook friends to any other abortion rights organization, to the best of my financial ability. "
26770000918,"Although I am an atheist, morally, I am opposed to abortions. I wont go at length as to why I feel this way, but there it is. However, I recognize that this is a personal moral, one that (probably) roughly half the population disagrees with. This being the case, I have absolutely no right whatsoever to force my belief on anyone else, especially about something that has such large real world implications and consequences. We all know the issues with banning out clinics such as Planned Parenthood. How can a person, who is fully aware and knowledgeable of the consequences, still claim to stand on the moral high ground and force those implications into reality, condemning thousands of REAL world lives in the name of you not wanting to feel uncomfortable with it? This is the question I pose to Governor Perry and those of his ilk. I personally would never vote in favor of abortion. My morality would not allow it. Nor would I vote against it, for my morality would not allow that either. I may personally disagree and feel uncomfortable about something, but that doesnt mean I get to dictate actions that have never and will never (I would think) affect me. Morality should *never* be the sole basis of writing law. It can be argued that even things like murder, theft, or rape isnt illegal on solely moral grounds; these actions are all extremely detrimental to individuals AND society as a whole. What detriment does abortion inflict on society? On me?"
26770002311,"Like it or not, its a shame that this is the tactic that must be used to kill a bill."

Unless you have personally adopted a child I dont wanna hear that THEY HAVE ADOPTION Bull$hit. look into the terrible state of American orphanages and you can see for yourself the compassion of pro-lifers

All these damn bible beating politicians make me sick."
26770058247,Good for her. Im a Republican and I believe abortion is wrong but at the same time its none of my business to tell a woman what to do with her body and its about time people start minding their own business and stop telling other people what to fucking do.. The Republican Party and Conservatives have a lot of good ideas but they wont get anywhere until they give up this abortion and anti gay shit. Lets move on to the next century guys and gals. There is a New World Order and there is no room for that stupid shit anymore.

26770064422,"Heres my (male) take: if youre a man, stay the hell away from this debate. You dont get to tell a woman she cant do something with her body, especially because we NEVER have to go through the process of pregnancy and/or childbirth. Its so ignorant I could scream."
26770065325,I hope she has the strength to go all the way. What about government not sticking their nose in your medical business. If they are clueless to the point of saying your body would take care of an unwanted pregnancy in the case of a legit rape; I say the should NOT give their darn opinion
26770066067,"Oh Rick Perry! I remember that guy, hes the guy that wants state-sanctioned prayer day and cant form complete sentences. They let him make laws?"
26770068799,"The Texas House and Senate are a terrible place of ignorance. They pay around $7500 over the course of 2 years for the positions, so you end up with nothing except peoples wives and rich assholes that have no idea what the average person needs."

26770081442,They are trying to end the filibuster because she put a back brace on.
26770081971,"Its funny how the official Republican party line is no abortions and yet theyre also anti-social programs to help the poor. I find it ironic that the party will claim to care about people before theyre born and then turn around and tell them to suck it up or, essentially die, after theyre born. I applaud Wendy Davis and her one-woman effort to fight for the right to abort a pregnancy. A pregnancy for people who the Republicans demand carry to full term. A pregnancy that will cost a mother (and maybe even a father) a lot of money with no one to pick up the bill. A pregnancy whose child may one day be that loser bum that the Republicans hate. The one that theyd be happy to watch die homeless, sick, or starving..because its all about personal responsibility. All of these people talk about children like theyre all going to grow up to be valuable members of society. Thats not true. Some will grow up to be murderers. Some will grow up to leech off of the system. Some will grow up and have no discernable impact on society (good or bad). And yet if any todays unborn, magical, right to life collection of cells get to a point in life that they will need help, they would meet the cold, unfeeling shoulders of Republicans who will do nothing to lift a finger to help. What a sad, shitty joke."
26770086465,Anybody got some info on the bills shes going after? Is it like the how wide are your hallways? stuff in other states? Or one of those fetal pain bills?
26770086616,ones ability to stand should not dictate what laws are passed. I admire her dedication but the system is a joke and we should be embarassed.
26770091347,Wtf? They are calling a point of order over if Senator leaned too much while being assisted with a back brace and the filibuster should be over
26770096667,"I want to start an organization that funds transportation for women that need services that are going to be lost after this bill passes or if they would like to leave the state and help them start a new life in a different state that has stronger womens rights.

26770103184,This is incredible. My utter respect to her. Sen. Judith Zaffirini is also serving some truths right now.

26770122867,Many of my friends and family members are in the building right now. One of my friends got a picture from inside the overflow chamber in the capitol building. http://instagram.com/p/bAHWkXr5kQ/ 
26770126143,I love how the filibuster is being filibustered by the people in the senate. 
26770129212,Go girl!
26770129575,So can someone explain to me the rules here? I have a few questions that are confusing me on the matter. * Why cant anyone else also filibuster with her? Or can only one person filibuster a bill? * What exactly is she allowed to do other than talk? is she required to stand for 13 hours straight? * What are voting rules during a filibuster? I remember something about how votes can be made to end it or something of the nature.
26770129730,Why couldnt a Senator that supports her stance ask her a bunch of questions to waste time?
26770131736,She currently has 2 strikes against her for breaking the filibuster. One more strike and its over. She cannot receive assistance from others (earlier one strike from help with her back brace) and she must stay on topic.
26770132720,The Lt Gov is a Republican I am assuming for being such an ass?
26770134935,Texas is such a fucking horrible place that one of the few sane people in charge is doing such an arduous task for something that shouldnt even be an issue. God bless this fucking horrible country. 
26770137720,"If you are in Texas, please consider sharing your story or a friends story on not only abortion, but womens health issues in general. She needs these to keep her filibuster going. 500 words or less! http://wendydavisforsenate.com/standwithwendy/"
26770151818,"Fuck Rick Perry. Seriously, fuck that guy."
26770157703,"I think the focus of the argument should be less about the morality of abortion and more about whether this law is driven by religious beliefs. Lots of people believe that life begins as early as conception and to terminate it amounts to murder. Those people have every right to that belief. But, those who believe differently must have their rights respected, too. In my opinion, to pass a law that forces everyone to adhere to one set of religious moral standards, even if the overwhelming majority agree, would be a complete trampling of the rights of the people who believe differently and should therefore be considered a direct violation of our first amendment. Regrettably, the belief of many is that Gods law trumps human law, thus making the beliefs of others, and our inalienable rights, irrelevant. I dont expect that my shpeel will change anything, I just wish to voice my own opinion, as is my right. My opinion is that the fact that were even entertaining the idea of a law based solely on religious arguments is absolutely ridiculous, given that the documents upon which our country was built, the very ones for which an entire war was fought, made it inescapably clear that there is to be a separation of church and state for no reason other than to protect our freedom to practice, without persecution, whichever religion we choose. "
26770158370,Reminding everyone inspired by Wendy Davis to support organizations that help women run for office. Some examples: * [EMILYs List](http://emilyslist.org/) * [She Should Run](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/) * [Womens Campaign Fund](http://www.wcfonline.org/)
26770160519,"The Texas Democratic representatives in the state House and Senate have been absolute heroes all week. Its been sass and kicked ass at every hearing.

26770182020,Go get em Wendy! Show the Wingnuts that reason isnt dead yet!
26770183218,"To those that dont understand how this bill will close womens clinics that also perform abortions: The bill requires that all doctors performing an abortion have admitting privileges to a local hospital. Seems reasonable on the surface. Wouldnt it be in the best interests of a womans health for her doctor that performed an abortion to be able to treat her for any emergency at a local hospital? Scratch the surface just a little bit and you will quickly see that thats not the case at all. To begin with the assumption has to be made that a local hospital even exists and if it does that she cant receive any emergency care there besides the doctor that originally performed the abortion. Many clinics are in rural areas (Texas is a big state) with limited access to ambulatory services and if complications do occur she can be treated by any attending emergency doctor at any hospital so there is no real need for admitting privileges(AP). AP are not automatic. It can only be granted by hospital administrators and is usually restricted to specific procedures. In addition, hospitals that are non-profit religious based will deny AP to any doctors that perform abortions. If you do the slightest research it becomes apparent that a lot of hospitals have become associated or bought up by religious organizations and have agreed to abide by their religious restrictions despite the views of the doctors themselves. Okay, so just go to another hospital you say? Its more than likely there isnt one unless youre lucky enough to live close to a county hospital and even then, I wouldnt go there if my life literally depended on it. Lastly, the bill requires a clinic that performs abortions be compliant with the same standards of a surgical clinic. I would be on board with this especially in the wake of the horrific conditions uncovered with the late abortion clinic. Im not because abortion clinics, along with dentists, podiatrists and a myriad of of other specialists perform minor surgery in office settings and comply with these codes. They are only making a special exception for gynecologists that perform abortions which reveals their hypocrisy. If a dentist that extracted an impacted tooth had to comply with these same laws then you should expect to have to go to a hospital. "

Claiming that an abortion related sonogram bill isnt germaine to a filibuster about abortion is ridiculous. And then attempting to table the appeal to this rule without allowing a vote or discussion about it!

26770434146,"Did they ever call a vote to actually end the filibuster? I just reviewed the notes and didnt see it. The ruling was if she got 3 warnings (lets just assume those warnings were valid .. and at least 2 of them werent.) THEN they would put the vote to the body to end the debate. They never did that. They started the appeal to challenge the 3rd warning, then stuff happened, then tabled. Then procedural inquiries Then bedlam. Then called roll.. more yelling, then apparently they voted. But as far as I can tell they never voted to end the filibuster. Anyone have info on this?"

Isnt there something to be said for allowing people to make decisions for themselves and face the consequences of them for themselves? If more women were held to account and were educated and supported in their decisions, these points would be moot, women would only have abortions out of great need and when they feel like they cant protect their born baby. Instead we create a society where we disempower women, make choices for them, limit their options and then expect them to act like they live in fantasy fairy land where all children are precious to their communities and have all the resources they need to live perfect lives. AND then we shun them and punish them when it all doesnt magically work out !? I AM SICK OF THIS RUBBISH! YOU CANT FORCE PEOPLE TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION. EVEN GOD GAVE US FREE WILL.

This time, they had to lie to stop the filibuster, then time ran out on them. It led to real drama, and people talking about it, which is good. But given the current political climate, they will try again, and they wont make all those mistakes next time. UPDATE: I spoke too soon. Some [polls appear to show](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/jun/27/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-majority-texans-support-faile/) that most Texans are not in favor of more abortion restrictions.

26770876715,Why are politicians like Rick Perry in office?
26742355490,Because many voters can neither spell nor define infrastructure. They often dont understand marginal and effective tax rates so they dont or would not want to move into the next tax bracket and lose money. There are voters who do not know what LIBOR is and why rigging it would be a scandal/problem.
26742164807,"Infrastructure improvements are almost a freebie. That work would require vastly increasing employment (to actually do that work) and by moving that many workers from public assistance to becoming tax payers, and the increases in employment to support them as valuable consumers. The only drawback is the reason this does not happen. By decreasing the numbers of people fighting for limited jobs you force down the price of labor, and this is why shortsighted corporations fight against these programs. Why we continue to vote for those who work against improving our nations services, I have no idea."
26742708464,"Interesting, I fall within those numbers and have always paid taxes, roughly 20%. "
26742488675,"&gt; and by moving that many workers from public assistance to becoming tax payers Just like many spending programs, this is nice in theory. The only problem is that the middle class doesnt really pay taxes anymore. Sure, they pay into Medicare and Social Security, but thats just about it. In 2010, a family of four earning $50,000 per year paid $-37 in income taxes. And yes, thats a negative sign. [[source]](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/09/obamas-teacher-tax-whopper/)"
26994070787,"Except that article assumes 4.7 million cancellation notices means 4.7 million lost insurance which is idiotic. Most of the cancellation notices include automatic roll-over into a new plan, plus the *AP article that they cite* detailed that some states decided to allow insurers to continue non-grandfathered plans after the notices were sent, invalidating a lot of them. Ill take conjecture over completely invalid logic anyday."
26994686363,"As I have said here before: If its time to renew my car insurance and my insurer says, In your new policy, we no longer cover 100% of hail damage, but we are going to start covering the first 25 miles of towing. No one in their right mind would say I LOST my car insurance. Its a disingenuous twist for the lazy press to follow the GOP talking points and say people are losing their insurance. [As POLITIFACT noted:](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-under-his-health-care-law-those-/) BEFORE the ACA, in a government study of one average year; over 14% of people lost their insurance plan, and a whopping 1/3 (around 15 MILLION people) lost their plans due to changes made by their employers."

26865601664,"That article says it is against the law, and completely up the prosecutor. It also doesnt address the issue of gay married people being allowed to transfer a gun to their spouse, because it cant happen, because the feds dont recognize gay marriage."
26865288548,"&gt;What is wrong with verifying that a person that wants a handgun can show they are responsible with it and if not then that privilege is taken away? Absolutely nothing, but thats not what these laws do. These laws, specifically the recent background check laws, do nothing to address any of the issues and concerns. They criminalize law abiding citizens for extremely stupid reasons. These are the situations that would now be felony if these laws passed. 1. If you rent, have a roommate, leave for more than 3 days, with your guns at home, both you and your roommate have committed a felony. 2. If you want to leave your fiance a gun, even if she is licensed to carry her one, that would be a felony. 3. Gay couples, married or not, under federal law would not be granted the same status as a hetero couple, therefore discriminating against them, and making them felons. 4. Letting someone else shoot your gun, felon. 5. Giving your brother/sister a gun, felony. 6. Transfers between step parent/step child, felony. This is even in the case of everyone being legally able to own a gun. And, couple that to the fact that there is no registry, completely unenforceable, and up to severe law enforcement interpretation. &gt;The voter ID laws coming from the ~~Republican~~ *Democratic* side of the aisle are working to put obstacles into the process for *law biding* people that would ~~have voted for the wrong party.~~ *buy/own a gun.* FTFY.

27003221182,"Exactly. Ive had that exact same conversation with my aunt. She retired a few years ago after nearly *forty years* as a nurse in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Naysayers *never* understand the core differences between preventative care and reactionary care, or what they mean for costs in the long run. The fun part of this is that Insurance companies look down on preventative care because its a cost *now*, otherwise they would encourage people on their plans to get checked up regularly by simply waving co-pays for routine checkups. Its pretty obvious why our healthcare system is the way it is when you understand that insurance maximizes its profits by convincing you to skip preventative checkups now, only to cut your benefits later when you need them. Dont pay now, and dont pay later. Its how insurance companies maximize their profits."
27003105946,"Pre-fucking-cisely. How many people do you know who put off going to the doctor until something gets really bad? Now think of all the people *poorer* than your friends and family; think theyre getting preventative care?

He has been willing to compromise. Cruz hates obamacare, he always has, yet he was willing to compromise to the point of just delaying the mandate 1 year. The government would have never been shutdown if this compromise was met by the senate, it wasnt so it shut down. Then now after the shutdown Obama decides to delay the mandate anyway...

27156578597,"Im one of those 750,000. I work as an adjunct professor at a community college. I earn only $505/month when I actually get paid. I do not get paid in the months of May, September, or January. (That assumes that I teach Fall, Spring, AND Summer.) The college claims that I only work 4 hours a week. I work many more than that. I earn too little to get any subsidies from the ACA. And the states rules make it impossible for me to get any benefits whatsoever. (Ive been told multiple times that I would never, ever qualify for Medicaid or Section 8 (the lack of income 3 disparate months out of the year is part of the reason), and I would have to have an employer claim I work 20 hours a week minimum to get the minimum SNAP assistance. I am soon to be homeless--the class B trailer with no electricity or plumbing is scheduled to be towed off the RV lot because it got purchased by someone who is going to raze the park and build high-dollar condominiums instead. The lack of housing will likely mean that I will not be able to teach anymore, as I doubt a shelter will let me stay with even the partial income I have, and I will likely get arrested as I try to ultralight camp in the Big Pine Key Key Deer reserve to survive. This summer will likely be the last term I ever teach, if I can make it that far. No one else wants to hire me. Once Im homeless, getting a job will be nearly impossible: even with a place, no one has wanted to hire me because of conflicts with my teaching schedule OR they claim that my education disqualifies me OR they tell me that I misrepresented myself on the application if I dont mention my education, and they wont hire a liar for the job. Ive thrown in the towel. I will probably die from something preventable in my late 40s to mid-50s (Im 45 now), if I dont take matters into my own hands before then. Im doing everything I can to keep myself above water, but it seems futile. People dont want to hire me because of my depression, yet no one is willing to treat it unless I have lots of money. (When I finally found a treatment that seemed to work back in the days when I was teaching 75 piano students weekly and have the back taxes to prove it, the treatment cost over $600/month counting dr visit and medications. Ive been unmedicated now for over 2 years and am down to just 6 piano students spread out between Ft. Lauderdale and Key West.) No one is willing to risk taking a chance on me anymore, and I dont feel like I have the strength or confidence to try again. No matter what my successes were in the past, I am now a failure to my family, my school, and myself. Your only worth in this world is what you can provide to it, and the world has shown that it doesnt want what I can offer. I cant pay for the possibility of other opportunities (getting temporary certification to teach K-12 in Florida will cost me almost $500 that I dont have, so I cant even apply for band director or choral director jobs). I cant afford to move. I cant afford to stay. So be it."

Voldemort, as I will call him until I have no need to think of this subhuman anymore, is a wanton thief who abuses his power for personal gain. He is only for small government for those who are rich enough to donate to him or hire a lobbyist. If you are poor, well you need big papa government to make sure that you are not smoking weed. You need big government to make sure that you dont challenge established companies in things like beer production. Just an utter and total scumbag.

27156546360,"&gt;In short, your state leaders lied when they told you they would come up with an alternative to Medicaid expansion. They didnt lie if pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps or borrowing 40k from your parents retirement account are considered alternatives. People should really spend 1 minute trying to understand the conservative-think. In their minds all this shit is 100% above board, rational, honest, good, etc. There is nothing sneaky about it. The only sneaky thing, from a conservative and libertarian viewpoint, is poor people getting medical care they didnt pay for. I loathe conservatives and libertarians. But I am not stupid. I understand them. I dont play games. I know what their positions are. We are being too gracious and too polite when we call what the conservative politicians are doing sneaky or lies or whatever. Its neither lies nor sneaky. Its all done in the open and with an understanding shared by much of their base."

I have no idea how the state is going to afford it. What really makes it bad is that these states could have created a state based exchange or other state based solutions. They rejected a state based solution for the actual insurance and opted to use the federal website. But then when it comes to medicaid which the feds would be paying for, now they MUST have a state solution. It makes no sense."

The expansion that was turned down isnt about health *care*. Theyre about money. Health care remains *available* to those 750,000 Floridians, its a matter of who is paying for it. Now, if we want to have a discussion about whether its affordable, or who should subsidize it if its not, thats fine. But can we please stop making this issue something other than what it is - redistribution of wealth. Edit: I think insurance is fundamentally the wrong approach to health care, and would support a single-payer or similar solution. In the meantime, all ACA does is shift the burden of cost for insurance from one party to another. It does nothing to improce healthcare, it just redistributes the cost. For every dollar someone saves, someone else is going to be paying more (whether through taxes, or higher premiums on non-subsidized policies)."

The ACA isnt even close to perfect, and I think we all agree there may need to be changes, but at least someone in Washington actually tried putting one of these ideas into action. Thats how you solve problems. "
27156597914,"I could see the economic reasoning for this, and the political. Florida has a larger population of older citizens than other states, and these older citizens will utilize their health care far more than the young. If the healthy youth in an insurance pool are charged to pay for the care of the less healthy elderly, then one must assume the insurance costs to the young are higher in Florida. What we are probably seeing is class/ageist warfare between the old need the care or will die, and the young who need the money in order to live the kind of life that their predecessors had. In a society that refuses to acknowledge homeless in the streets for a couple of cents, this is not far of a stretch.

27156613912,What do you expect? The GOP acts in the interests of its few thousand uber-wealthy patrons and acts against the rest of America.

Doing a good job too. Sure, you say, they havent passed a single bill! But theyve told us theyre doing it, and much better than those awful Democrats. Thats how you know theyre doing a great job. Looks like the great elected officials in Florida are just continuing doing the Good Work. "

27156747572,What happens after the feds stop footing the bill for expanded medicaid? My guess: Fire teachers to come up with the funds to pay for it. Thatll be popular.

Well fuck politics when it comes to health. I am so glad I do not have to live in a country where giving birth is a fucking stress.

Share the fucking wealth. Your neighbour will one day save you. Whatever rant done."

Georgia made the same decision by refusing to allocate funds for development of trauma centers. Basically, the weak, poor, sick, and stupid better get out of those states if they want to continue being taken care if unconditionally. Not to mention that a significant number of Floridas uninsured happen to be illegal immigrants. Seems like they knew exactly what they were doing and theyre happy with that conscious decision."

27156778842,"The real kick in the teeth for Florida is that the federal government quit subsiding the uninsured, because that was going to be covered by expanded medicaid. So not only did Florida decline the federal money to support the expansion they also lost money that went straight to the states hospitals to cover the uninsured/underinsured."
27156822609,I live in Florida. And I know plenty of poor people that got insured for the first time ever through healthcare.gov Now I know this is my personal Anecdote but who cant get healthcare here in my state and why? 
27156855886,None of this matters. Republicans are against gay marriage and abortion. All these morons that lost their health care coverage wont give a shit about their healthcare as long they keep voting on those 2 hot ticket issues.
27156856658,"Governor Brewer and our state legislature did one thing right. They didnt let Arizonans suffer without health insurance. And they very easily could have not passed the expansion as well as lie about why they werent going to pass it. This state is awful politically, but at least it aint Florida."

Its weird thinking that a state thats almost equal in minority population sees republicans win every major election. Why is that?

27157210166,So...hows the ACA looking now? Seems like some those republican states that opted out would rather criticize than help their citizens. Good on those for actually coming up with a plan even though the Republican Party still hasnt come up with an Obamacare replacement. 
27157278726,"&gt; Theyre just hoping that voters arent paying close attention in an election year. ... they havent paid much attention in the last eight years, have they?"
27157295572,"At this point Im simply happy I was able to get an exemption this year (from the fine) for not being able to get health care. Any health care plan is at least over twice our yearly income, and since I live in FL I would have qualified if they expanded medicaid, but so it goes. Luckily the government was understanding (after two weeks of phone calls) and isnt forcing us to pay the (95?) dollar fee because of this situation (for one year). Life with one family member with cancer, another with brain damage, a third with fibromyalgia and a fourth recovering from pnuemonia with no health care can be rough, but Ill take the wins I can no matter how small. "
27157307617,This is blatantly all Obamas fault by destroying the private healthcare insurance market. Yet its being spun in a way to appear as Republicans are personally attacking citizens healthcare. So amazing what you can do with the media on your side.
27157390675,So are the Republican states referenced in the article not on Obamacare or what? How could that be cost effective?

And there is a pretty clear formulation of the Iraq War by Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bill Kristol, and all their neocon buddies prior to 9/11. Furthermore, since we were specifically talking about AL GORE, it should be noted that he was opposed to it in 2002 http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/gore/gore092302sp.html"
26730392541,"For what its worth, [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/) has Obama at 22% promises broken. Not bad."
26730441599,"From your link quoting Al Gores prepared statements: &gt;Nevertheless, Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power. Moreover, no international law can prevent the United States from taking actions to protect its vital interests. &gt; We also need to look at the relationship between our national goal of regime change in Iraq and our goal of victory in the war against terror. In the case of Iraq, it would be more difficult for the United States to succeed alone, but still possible. By contrast, the war against terror manifestly requires broad and continuous international cooperation. Our ability to secure this kind of cooperation can be severely damaged by unilateral action against Iraq. If the Administration has reason to believe otherwise, it ought to share those reasons with the Congress  since it is asking Congress to endorse action that might well impair a more urgent task: continuing to disrupt and destroy the international terror network. Here are some more from the current democratic leadership and others: Pelosi in 98: Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process. Bill Clinton in 98: If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraqs weapons of mass destruction program. John Kerry Oct 02: "
26730379353,"&gt;Im sorry honeybunch sugarplum. Maybe you dont remember how the Bush administration went before congresses and lied but I do. There were the 21 Senate Democrats - along with one Republican and one Independent - who voted against the war resolution. And 126 of 207 House Democrats voted against the resolution as well. They got just enough of the corrupt democrats like Kerry, Biden, Clinton, Reid to go along with it though. Not to mention they had months and months to look over intelligence reports and even had access to Bushs intelligence reports. yet they all ended up saying exactly what Bush was saying about WMD. &gt;Funny how you bring up a Republican who demanded and campaigned on the repeal of the ACA. No one lies more than a politician on the campaign trail. He didnt bring up his assault weapons ban during the campaign either. I wonder why? Because he was a severe conservative. lol."

26727145602,"Ok, Candy."
26727159755,factcheck.org is a biased source and the other page confirms what I originally claimed. that obama called it an act of terror the day after the attack.
27126624936,"It is Republicans who enact laws requiring immigrants to carry ID. Republicans who scream of terrorist sneaking over the border to behead our fair blond heads. Republians who ban the study of hispanic history. Most importantly, it is Republicans who block all immigration reform. It is Obama who moved to strike down Arizonas claim to decide citizenship. It is Obama who has championed the Dream act. It is Obama who has ordered extensions to hundreds of thousands of the children of illegal immigrants. The charge that he is not waving his magic president wand is the sad foot stamp! declaration that politics is for daydreamers staring into a mirror and shouting what they would do, if they were relevant. Cant blame them for dreaming. The Obama administration issued a politically charged executive order that will make about 800,000 young people who were brought to the United States illegally as children safe from deportation proceedings, and may make them eligible for work permits. The policy was announced by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. http://www.snopes.com/politics/immigration/dreamact.asp#2U3WXbumSfAQWr0d.99"
27126594012,"Utter bullshit. While theres something to the sentiment that the responsibility does not lie *solely* with the Obama Administration (indeed, its never that simple), you are giving him far more credit than he deserves for his alleged attempts to introduce a humane approach to immigration. The point is that were looking at about an average of 1,000 deportations *per day*. Those are families torn apart. Children left without caretakers. Fathers and mothers and sons and daughters who just disappear, often without any warning and often under extremely Constitutionally-dubious circumstances. And the fact of the matter is that there is plenty Obama couldve done already - things he could do *today* - to minimize the impact our immigration policies have on millions of people. Stroke of a fucking pen, he could expand his Deferred Action program to include a larger segment of the population. He could put an end to Secure Communities. He could greatly neuter the amount of power thats been afforded to ICE. He could alleviate the suffering and fears of hundreds of thousands of families. Instead, hes opted to throw us breadcrumbs and nothing more. He does not get to escape accountability here."
27126643869,"As I already said, Im well aware of the breadcrumbs hes tossed us to keep us placated enough. However, he doesnt need a magic president wand to do something about Secure Communities or expand Deferred Action, both of which would have a greater impact than everything else youve cited. 800,000 young people safe from deportation proceedings? Great! But as long as local law enforcement agencies continue to be compelled to cooperate with Immigrations and Customs to round people up off of the streets, many of those children will be separated from their parents. Thats no victory. Again, to characterize any movement in these areas as demanding a wave of his magic wand is incredibly disingenuous, and a sad attempt to once more insulate the president from the burden of responsibility he *shares* in this situation. No, blame does not fall squarely on him. But the tone with which you seem to exalt him with doesnt do anyone any favors."
26827698857,"&gt; So he should get credit for the good things in the economy (corporate profits) while remaining immune to criticism about the things that suck about the economy? Generally speaking, presidents get too much of the credit and too much of the blame for what happens in the economy. No matter what the circumstances, the president tends to have less control over it than critics or fans will assume. http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/11/presidential-blame-credit/ http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/12/obama-claim-economic-victory-or-not/ http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/25/can-a-president-control-gas-prices-depends-on-when-you-ask/ "
26827631645,"&gt; So he should get credit for the good things in the economy (corporate profits) while remaining immune to criticism about the things that suck about the economy? No, he should be given credit, good and bad, for things that have changed, esp due to policies hes pushed through, since hes been in office. He should not be held responsible for those things that are more foundational, or that are not within his realistic ability to affect, for a variety of reasons. I think its safe to say the Stimulus Package (whens the last time you even heard that phrase, compared to often we heard about it when it was supposed to be the devils pill?) has had its effects, including lowering the unemployment, etc. House prices have rebounded. And given the situation he inherited, I think hes done a decent job with the budget crisis as well. Corporate profits and worker share of profits are things that are guarded like few other things, and are deeply rooted in the way this country is run, including the media, going back to mccarthyism. Frankly, I think you just dont like Obama, and arent very interested in a neutral analysis, with further educating yourself about our economy and political system. But excuse the ad hominem opinion."
26827654140,"&gt;Frankly, I think you just dont like Obama, and arent very interested in a neutral analysis, with further educating yourself about our economy and political system. But excuse the ad hominem opinion. Of course I dont like Obama, but its absolutely ridiculous and base that you would assume ignorance is the cause of that. Im not exactly sure what you mean by a neutral analysis, are you triangulating between the parties of today, or are you considering relative cultural, historical, and international norms? And the ad hom isnt just a lazy substitute for an argument (which seems to be one of an impotent executive), its so far off base as to be laughable. My degree is in political economy, and my minor was history. Specifically, I set out to study the rise and fall of empires when I realized I had a great example of an empire in decline outside my door. "
26827326866,"&gt; and thats not an accident when you stuff your economic team full of bankers &amp; investors. This. A thousand times this. Barack Obama is not a progressive. Hes not a liberal. Hes not a socialist or a Democrat. First and foremost hes a corporatist. He wouldnt have gotten the job otherwise. Dont believe me? Look up Larry Summers, who hes probably gonna nominate to chair the Federal Reserve."
26827288924,"&gt;nor can it be addressed by a sitting President. So he should get credit for the good things in the economy (corporate profits) while remaining immune to criticism about the things that suck about the economy?
